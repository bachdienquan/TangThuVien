She was in a simple white cotton dress, and her long hair was loosely curled. Her look was neither gaudy nor lavish; it was simple, yet fully capable of withstanding any scrutiny. Her makeup was likewise applied lightly, and she clutched a white handbag in her hand. This, paired with a pair of plain black heels, made her look like a goddess from a secluded and peaceful oasis. </p><p>Her beauty wasn't the type to awe the masses, but her facial features were delicate and easy to remember. She gave others the feeling of being caressed by a gentle spring wind. There were such women in the world, whose beauty was not stunning but still enchanting all the same. And it just so happened that Huo Mian was one of those few women, who could captivate those around her with her unique presence. </p><p>\"Oh my, Huo Mian, you're here! Hurry upstairs to the Peony Room on the second floor. Everyone's waiting there. If they knew you came, they'd all be overjoyed!\" At the door, old classmates who were in charge of welcoming guests gave her directions with warm smiles. Huo Mian nodded, returning the smile as she made her way slowly towards the second floor. She didn't know why, but she felt an unplaceable sense of unease bubbling up inside of her. This was a feeling that she hadn't had in a very long time. </p><p>Truth be told, she rarely attended these high-school reunions. It wasn't that Huo Mian was unsociable, or that she thought she was too good for them. Only that, during those three years of high school, someone left such a deep mark in her heart and soul that she had subconsciously avoided all of these events. </p><p>This time, she only chose to attend because her high school homeroom teacher personally called and invited her. Ms. Yao was over sixty years old and had retired a long time ago. From what Huo Mian heard, she immigrated to New Zealand with her daughter some time ago. But now, not only did she suddenly return to the country, she also organized this reunion. Huo Mian really had no reason to refuse. Although she was never the type of student that caught the teacher's attention through academics, she was as fond of Ms. Yao as her old classmates were. </p><p>Besides, that person's been missing for seven years. There is no way he will show up for this reunion, right? Reassuring herself, Huo Mian struggled to suppress her unease. </p><p>When she finally pushed through the door, there were already twenty or so people inside. Hearing the door open, they all looked over at the entrance and saw Huo Mian smiling timidly. </p><p>\"Hi, everyone. It's been a while,\" she greeted. </p><p>\"Hey, if it isn't the beautiful Miss Huo, what a surprise that you actually came to a reunion! Hell must be freezing over,\" one of her female classmates said in a mocking tone. </p><p>Huo Mian smiled awkwardly and didn't reply. Just then, the Class President, Han Xu, stood up and walked over with a warm greeting, \"Huo Mian. It's been a while, everyone missed you! How're you doing these days?\" </p><p>\"Oh, I'm doing well, Class President,\" Huo Mian looked around the room. When she didn't see the homeroom teacher, she couldn't stop herself from asking, \"Where's Ms. Yao?\" </p><p>\"Ah, Ms. Yao just called and said that she's stuck in traffic. She'll be here soon. Come on, take a seat first.\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded. Finding a quiet corner, she sat down and listened to the loud banter of the classmates around her. </p><p>It had been many years since they graduated from high school, and everyone had changed. Some were now famous entrepreneurs, some were working for the government, and some others had gone to study abroad. All in all, compared to these people, the girl who'd once been touted as a genius with an IQ of 130 could not appear any more ordinary right now. </p><p>After graduating high school, she rejected colleges in the capital city and surprised everyone when she applied to the nursing school at a local medical academy. After graduation, she went directly into the provincial hospital to become a nursing intern, signing a 3-year contract. </p><p>Now, she had a stable relationship with an intern in the ophthalmology department of the hospital where she worked. Although his family background was fairly average, he had a decent future ahead of him. Huo Mian felt that she could ask nothing more from this life. She didn't wish for wealth and fortune, only stability and security.</p><p>Then, someone suddenly patted her back. Startled, Huo Mian turned around.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":1,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:38.053","Link":"Chapter-1","NameDisplay":"Chapter 1"},{"ID":181120947385532237,"Name":"Chapter 2: The Man of Her Dreams","NameUnsign":"Chapter 2: The Man of Her Dreams","Description":"<p>Chapter 2: The Man of Her Dreams</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian sighed in relief when she saw who it was.</p><p>\"Lingling, are you trying to scare me to death?\"</p><p>\"Hey, I thought we agreed that you'd wait for me by the doors first so we can come in together. I can't believe you ran in before me,\" Lingling said as she pulled up a chair and sat next to Huo Mian.</p><p>\"I was going to wait for you, but I saw an old classmate by the door. He said that everyone was upstairs, so I came up.\" Huo Mian smiled gently.</p><p>The one that greeted her was Zhu Lingling, her best friend since high school, who was now a flight attendant for an international airline. She was a pretty girl and was Huo Mian's only close girlfriend. Like Huo Mian, she was amiable and exceptionally kindhearted.</p><p>\"Lingling, I thought you've been busy recently.\"</p><p>\"How can I not be busy? I'm super busy! We were supposed to fly to Xing City today, but I didn't want to miss our reunion so I asked a colleague to cover my shift. Oh hey, where's your doctor? Why didn't you bring him?\"</p><p>\"He had a surgery scheduled today so he couldn't make it.\"</p><p>\"Not bad, not bad. I see a bright and promising future for him. By the way, how's your house-hunting going?\"</p><p>\"We're getting there. Out of the three apartments that we went to see, there was one that we both liked. We're going to talk to his parents about it before making a final decision.\"</p><p>\"Wow, that's fast. Where is it located? Buying a new place is a big deal, so you'd better think it through first,\" Zhu Lingling said.</p><p>\"It's on 3rd Ring Road so it takes a little over 20 minutes to get to work by bus. It's pretty convenient,\" Huo Mian replied as she smiled faintly.</p><p>\"Nice, I heard that apartments on 3rd Ring Road are worth an average of 8,000 Yuan per square meter. Your boyfriend must have some savings then!\" Zhu Lingling exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>\"It's not going to be a one-time payment. We're just placing a down payment for now, and the two of us will slowly pay off the rest of the mortgage. We're still young, and have plenty of time.\"</p><p>\"So… after buying the apartment, are you guys going to get married?\" Zhu Lingling asked as she reached out to hold Huo Mian's hand.</p><p>\"Yes, it seems so, if nothing unexpected happens.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>\"Mian.\"</p><p>\"Yeah?\"</p><p>\"Are you sure that you're willing to … get married, just like this?\" Zhu Lingling suddenly asked, with a serious expression on her face.</p><p>\"Well, at this point, does it matter if I'm willing or not?\"</p><p>\"Mian, you know why I'm asking. Have you really forgotten about him?\" Zhu Lingling lowered her voice down to a whisper, but Huo Mian still heard every word clearly. A trace of sadness appeared in her eyes, with a hint of almost undetectable heartache.</p><p>\"What's the point? So what if I'm not willing? This is how my life is supposed to be, and I've surrendered to it. I surrendered 7 years ago,\" Huo Mian said as she smiled bitterly.</p><p>Just as Zhu Lingling was about to say something else, the doors of the private room opened, prompting everyone to stand up immediately. Huo Mian and Zhu Lingling followed and looked towards the entrance. To her satisfaction, she saw their old homeroom teacher, Ms. Yao, whose hair was now greying…and, standing beside their teacher was…him?</p><p>The man who disappeared 7 years ago, the man who used to be the most important person in Huo Mian's life…it was like a dream for him to appear in front of her like this, giving her no time to prepare herself at all.</p><p>Huo Mian's entire body went numb, and her brain blanked out…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":2,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:38.553","Link":"Chapter-2","NameDisplay":"Chapter 2"},{"ID":1811209473942775,"Name":"Chapter 3: Anxiety","NameUnsign":"Chapter 3: Anxiety","Description":"<p>Chapter 3: Anxiety</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Oh god, did I see it right? That person...is that Qin Chu?\" A girl's surprised shriek came from the crowd, grabbing everybody's attention from the shock they were previously in.</p><p>\"Qin Chu… that really is Qin Chu,\" another girl repeated those words excitedly. </p><p>Huo Mian was completely stunned as she gazed at the silhouette by the door. That person stood out more so today than he did all those years ago. The glow radiating off of his body made it impossible for one to ignore him or look away. He was 185 centimeters tall, clothed in a black dress shirt and black pants. However, his simple outfit and neat, short hair looked dazzling on him. Those chiseled cheeks, sharp nose, thin lips, and deep eyes had appeared in Huo Mian's dreams countless times.</p><p>Now that she had seen him in person, she was speechless. At that moment, she felt as if her heart was about to pop out of her chest. </p><p>\"Mian, what did I just say? Speak of the devil and he shall appear. This situation is so cheesy that it could be from a soap opera,\" Zhu Lingling said to Huo Mian after she recovered from the initial shock, gently brushing Huo Mian's arm. </p><p>But, Huo Mian was completely unresponsive. Her gaze and thoughts were unmoved and still lingered on Qin Chu. </p><p>That man's appearance was untouched by the seven years that had gone by, other than the appearance of a hint of maturity and resilience in his facial features, indicating the passing of time. The corners of his lips formed a slight smile, which was unlike the younger and colder Qin Chu, who would never let such an expression show. Was it he that had changed? Or was it time that did?</p><p>Qin Chu scanned the room, but his gaze did not falter when it passed by Huo Mian, treating her like all the other classmates. An inexplicable feeling of disappointment stung Huo Mian's heart. </p><p>\"It's been a while,\" Qin Chu said after skimming the room. </p><p>\"Oh god, my darling, are you really back? Am I dreaming? Where have you been all these years?\" Liu Siying asked in excitement as she dashed towards Qin Chu.</p><p>Everybody knew that Liu Siying was crazily infatuated with Qin Chu back in high school. He was the reason she did not speak to Huo Mian, not even once, throughout high school. She regarded Huo Mian as her arch nemesis back then, and the relationship was still no better seven years later. As soon as she saw Qin Chu in the flesh, she did not hold back and jumped at him like a starving dog chasing after a bone.</p><p>The other girls surrounded Qin Chu as well, as everyone loved dreamy boys like him.</p><p>\"I've been studying in the United States this whole time,\" Qin Chu casually said in response to everyone's inquisitions. </p><p>It had been a whole seven years since Qin Chu disappeared completely. Nobody, not even his high school sweetheart, Huo Mian, knew where he had gone. </p><p>At that moment, the class president, Han Xu walked up with a smile on his face and said, \"It's good to have you back. This must be the closest we've had to a complete class. Come, Ms. Yao, please be seated. We can talk while we eat.\" </p><p>Ms. Yao was helped into the main seat by Qin Chu before he seated himself in the chair to her right. Just as Han Xu was about to sit down in the chair to Ms. Yao's left, he heard her call Huo Mian's name.</p><p>\"Ms. Yao?\" Huo Mian answered as she stood up. </p><p>\"Come and sit beside me.\" Ms. Yao gestured for her to come.</p><p>Han Xu was mortified. Luckily, he reacted quickly and followed Ms. Yao's words. \"Come here, Mian. It's been so long since she last saw you. Why don't you come sit here and catch up?\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded and walked closer, despite her unwillingness to do so.</p><p>With every step, her heart trembled harder. She was approaching Qin Chu step by step…</p><p>It might have been that she was too nervous, because as soon as she sat down, she knocked over the wine glass, shattering it on the floor.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":3,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:39.043","Link":"Chapter-3","NameDisplay":"Chapter 3"},{"ID":18112094739512950,"Name":"Chapter 4: Forced Kiss","NameUnsign":"Chapter 4: Forced Kiss","Description":"<p>Chapter 4: Forced Kiss</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I'm so sorry…\" Huo Mian quickly apologized.</p><p>During the commotion, someone handed her a piece of napkin which she used to clean the edge of her dress. It was only after she raised her head that she realized that it was Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" she spoke with a distant tone as if she had put their past relationship behind her.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't respond; he casually chatted with the other classmates and seemed to have turned his attention away from her.</p><p>This continued until Liu Siying purposely asked loudly in front of all of their classmates, \"Oh yeah, Huo Mian, I heard that you are getting married soon? Your fiancé is a doctor, right? Good for you. Don't forget to invite us to your wedding. After all, we were classmates.\"</p><p>After her words, the entire room fell dead silent as everyone watched Qin Chu's reaction closely.</p><p>\"Not yet. Our families are still discussing it, but I will notify everyone once we decide on a date,\" Huo Mian said with a bashful smile.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt a piercing glance towards her.</p><p>\"You are getting married?\" after a moment of silence, Qin Chu finally spoke to her for the first time.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded … for some reason, out of fear or nervousness, she couldn't even say the word 'yes'.</p><p>\"Oh, congratulations.\" There was a smile on his face, but his gaze was icy cold.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" said Huo Mian politely with awkwardness. She didn't dare to look directly at Qin Chu as his smile was too oppressive. She had imagined their encounter numerous times, but she never expected them to meet in this situation. At this thought, she was once again flustered.</p><p>\"It's such a pity. Back in the day, Huo Mian was one of the prettiest girls in school. I always thought that you would marry into a rich or influential family, but I never expected you to settle down so soon. Haha, what a pity. If I knew this would happen, I would have asked you out. Haha, why don't you consider me instead?\" Wei Dong said half-jokingly. He had always been a troublemaker during high school and had already had a few drinks.</p><p>Wei Dong came from a well-off family, and his father was in the construction business. With the booming real estate industry over the past few years, he was doing quite well following his father. Thus, during gatherings, he was always confident, even when he joked.</p><p>Zhu Lingling immediately rolled her eyes at him and said, \"Give me a break. You have no chance. You already lost to Prince Charming Qin when we were in school. How could you win Huo Mian's heart now?\"</p><p>Before she finished, Zhu Lingling suddenly realized that she had touched a forbidden territory so she quickly shut her mouth.</p><p>The relationship between Qin Chu and Huo Mian seemed to have turned into the plot from Jay Chou's movie -- Secret.</p><p>Qin Chu showed no reaction to Zhu Lingling's words. He simply continued to stare at Huo Mian with a piercing gaze.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled awkwardly before standing up. She said, \"Umm, excuse me, I need to use the washroom.\"</p><p>In reality, there was a washroom inside the private room they were in. Huo Mian simply wanted to find an excuse to escape from this situation or, more specifically, from Qin Chu.</p><p>After Huo Mian walked out of the dining room, she started to breathe heavily; she could even hear her heart rate accelerating.</p><p>Huo Mian never thought that she would reencounter Qin Chu under such circumstances. It had already been seven years, and his sudden appearance caught her by complete surprise.</p><p>After she calmed down a little in the washroom, she touched up her makeup before walking out with her head down. But before she knew what was happening, she was pushed against the wall by a large hand. Then…those icy lips suddenly approached her, and the foreign yet familiar presence caused Huo Mian's brain to immediately short-circuit.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":4,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:39.513","Link":"Chapter-4","NameDisplay":"Chapter 4"},{"ID":181120947401202520,"Name":"Chapter 5: Entanglement","NameUnsign":"Chapter 5: Entanglement","Description":"<p>Chapter 5: Entanglement</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Before Huo Mian had the chance to push him away, he suddenly let go of her hands. A wickedly alluring smile appeared on his face as he lifted Huo Mian's cheek.</p><p>With a magnetic voice, he said, \"Huo Mian, I'm back.\"</p><p>Huo Mian slightly trembled when she heard this familiar voice, and as she looked into his evocative eyes, the things that she had been suppressing for so long seemed to have resurfaced from deep within her.</p><p>She couldn't even remember how rushed she was as she left the washroom, or how she fumbled around to open the door. She only knew that she was in a complete daze.</p><p>\"Mian, what's wrong? Why…is your face so pale?\" Zhu Lingling stood up in a hurry to help Huo Mian.</p><p>\"I'm fine.\" Huo Mian's face was extremely pale even when she said nothing was wrong.</p><p>After a moment of thought, she decided to leave. Huo Mian carefully leaned toward Ms. Yao, and spoke into her ear, \"Ms. Yao, I'm sorry, but I have to leave now. I'll come by on my own and visit you some other time.\"</p><p>Ms. Yao looked at Huo Mian profoundly and nodded, \"Okay, be careful on your way back.\"</p><p>Huo Mian didn't care about anyone else's gaze as she grabbed her bag and left. Her exit was so abrupt that she even confused Zhu Lingling.</p><p>\"Huo Mian is so arrogant and fake, she has never attended any of the high school reunions. What a show! I knew something was up when she agreed to come this time. She must have found out in advance that Qin Chu would be here as well, and now she's going to leave in advance just to seduce him. What a scheming opportunist! She used the same cat and mouse trick to seduce Qin Chu back then, and now she's doing it again. She makes me sick,\" cursed Liu Siying nonstop.</p><p>The other classmates had no comments to make, because seven years had passed since the events between Qin Chu and Huo Mian took place.</p><p>Huo Mian knew that Qin Chu was too dangerous, and she felt the same bewilderment as she did back then. She thought that she had forgotten everything long ago, but who knew the same feelings would come back when she saw him today?</p><p>Memories poured out of her mind like a flood rushing out of a broken dam.</p><p>Many things happened on the night of their graduation seven years ago, and she once believed that she would never see Qin Chu again.</p><p>Later on, this man mysteriously disappeared, and no one knew where he had gone.</p><p>Now, he suddenly returned like magic. It was unbelievable.</p><p>Huo Mian lived in the ordinary world, so how could she possibly withstand this kind of torment?</p><p>No matter what, Huo Mian wouldn't dare to interact with Qin Chu again. Just like seven years ago, no matter how much they loved each other, they could never be together because they were from completely different worlds. In addition, she didn't think that they would cross paths again after that incident. After all that she had been through, her only dream now was to marry a stable man and live a comfortable life for all of her remaining years.</p><p>After she left the hotel and got into a taxi, her phone began ringing nonstop, and the calls were all from Zhu Lingling. Huo Mian didn't pick up because she had no clue what to say. Her mind was scattered as if she had lost the ability to think.</p><p>It was close to eleven when she returned to where she lived. Huo Mian opened the door and it was completely dark inside.</p><p>After turning on the lights, she noticed that no one was inside or outside of the bedroom. It seemed like Ning Zhiyuan hadn't gotten off from his night shift yet.</p><p>Her boyfriend, Ning Zhiyuan, rented this two-bedroom apartment after they both graduated. She lived here as well because it was easier to take care of Ning Zhiyuan, and also since it was close to the hospital she worked at. There was no need to take the bus and they could sleep in for a bit longer. The environment was very pleasant, and the rent was also within their budget. Huo Mian always thought that it would be great to live here until they bought their own place. Plus, with Ning Zhiyuan around, Huo Mian already felt hints of the warmth of a home. </p><p>They've been together for quite a long time now, but truth be told, Huo Mian was aware that most of their sentiments were more of mutual reliance than of love.</p><p>Huo Mian took a quick hot shower, changed into her pajamas, and returned to her bedroom to rest.</p><p>Just then, her phone suddenly began to ring, and she looked over to see an unfamiliar number.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":5,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:40.12","Link":"Chapter-5","NameDisplay":"Chapter 5"},{"ID":18112094740669186,"Name":"Chapter 6: The Proposal","NameUnsign":"Chapter 6: The Proposal","Description":"<p>Chapter 6: The Proposal</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>\"Hello?

We broke up seven years ago—\"</p><p>\"I'm downstairs.\" Qin Chu interrupted, immediately hanging up the phone before she could respond.</p><p>How does he know my address? Was it that big mouth, Zhu Lingling, blabbering again? Huo Mian thought. Thinking back to the event in the washroom, Huo Mian really didn't want to go downstairs. She had no intention of seeing him.</p><p>But if I don't go downstairs, would he keep waiting? Will he run into Ning Zhiyuan when Zhiyuan returns home?</p><p>Huo Mian wrapped herself in a jacket as possible scenarios played out in her head. After a moment of hesitation, she unwillingly made her way downstairs.</p><p>Sure enough, Qin Chu was downstairs with his back against a silver Audi R8, holding a lit cigarette between his fingers.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, what do you want?\" Huo Mian walked over to the man, glaring at him.</p><p>Lifting his head, Qin Chu intensely gazed at Huo Mian. It was those damn eyes again, the kind that made her feel as if she was the only girl he could see, as if he was still doting on her like how he used to.</p><p>\"Mian, you're still the same as before. You haven't changed a bit.\" Qin Chu gazed at her without blinking, his eyes full of emotions that were too complicated to explain.</p><p>With a bitter smile, Huo Mian responded, \"You're wrong, people do change. Qin Chu, regardless of what you're after, I hope that you can let go of the past. I'm tired, and I don't want the trouble anymore. Plus, we both have our own lives now, so could you please stop acting so crazily?\"</p><p>\"I'm not crazy. I've never been saner,\" Qin Chu said with the utmost sincerity.</p><p>\"Then why are you doing this? Just to reminisce with me?\" Huo Mian scoffed.</p><p>Qin Chu's eyes sparkled as he gazed deeply into her eyes. He then said faintly, \"Huo Mian, marry me.\"</p><p>Huo Mian almost lost her mind upon hearing those words.

Moreover, he was proposing, at the worst time and location, to the wrong person. This was probably the single most preposterous thing Huo Mian had ever experienced.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, stop it. We're not children anymore,\" Huo Mian's voice sounded hoarse as she turned her face away from him.</p><p>\"I'm not joking around,\" Qin Chu stared at Huo Mian's familiar face as he reiterated. </p><p>\"So you're just messing with my emotions? Are you enjoying yourself?\" Huo Mian laughed dryly, noticing the despair in her own voice.</p><p>\"I'm not.\"</p><p>\"So, you're telling me that you're serious?\" Huo Mian's fury turned into laughter as she looked at him, suddenly finding him ridiculous.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't reply, but his expression said it all.</p><p>Huo Mian took a deep breath in and pointed at him, \"Fine, Qin Chu, repeat what you just said.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, let's get married.\" He knew her well enough to repeat this statement immediately.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, listen to me. I am getting married, but not to you. You need to stop living in a fantasy because it's never going to happen between us.

You hurt me and almost destroyed me, but you'll never understand how I felt because you're not me. You never lived through the nightmare that I have. So please, we each have our own lives now and I have a boyfriend who loves me more than anything in this world. Just leave, I never want to see you again. To me, you're just a spell that can never be broken, so I would rather go on with my life without you in it.\"</p><p>Huo Mian thought that she had made herself very clear, so she turned around to head back upstairs.</p><p>However, Qin Chu suddenly grabbed her arm…</p><p>\"Let go of me! Qin Chu, what else do you want from me?\" Huo Mian barely finished her sentence before Qin Chu pulled her into his embrace.</p><p>He hugged Huo Mian so hard that her head smashed right onto his broad chest; she smelled the light scent of a Versace brand cologne on his white shirt. For a second, Huo Mian felt extremely comfortable and familiar in his arms. Tears welled up in her eyes as memories flashed by.</p><p>Surprised at herself, Huo Mian cursed in her head. Huo Mian, are you crazy? Don't you remember what this man did to you back then?</p><p>He's the devil, so why are you wasting your time talking to him? You're about to get married to Ning Zhiyuan now! Huo Mian suddenly came back to her senses at the thought of this.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, let go of me, you asshole, or else I'm going to scream for help!\" Huo Mian threatened him as she furrowed her eyebrows.</p><p>Yet, Qin Chu didn't seem to hear her – he closed his arms around her even more, unwilling to let go…</p><p>He hugged her tightly as if he had retrieved a piece of lost treasure. Qin Chu was not a man of many words; he was happy just to be able to hold Huo Mian in his arms like this. Coming back, he had one goal: no one will ever break them up again, no one.</p><p>Just then, Huo Mian heard a familiar voice behind her, \"What are you doing?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":7,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:41.19","Link":"Chapter-7","NameDisplay":"Chapter 7"},{"ID":181120947416654440,"Name":"Chapter 8: Misunderstanding","NameUnsign":"Chapter 8: Misunderstanding","Description":"<p>Chapter 8: Misunderstanding</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Startled, Huo Mian turned around. Standing not far behind them was her boyfriend, Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p>He seemed to have just come off his night shift. In his hand were Huo Mian's favorite snacks, grilled corn, and iced cola.</p><p>Huo Mian's mind finally snapped back into focus. Shoving Qin Chu away, she immediately explained, \"Zhiyuan, it… it's not what it looks like. Please don't misunderstand. Let me explain, alright?\"</p><p>\"Fine. I'm listening, explain.\" Surprisingly calm, Ning Zhiyuan glanced back at Huo Mian. Then, his gaze shifted towards Qin Chu, who was standing behind Huo Mian. His eyes were filled with animosity. Ning Zhiyuan knew Huo Mian very well and didn't think that she was the type to mess around behind his back. Huo Mian barely even used her WeChat, and her daily schedule was a bee-line between home and work. She was an honest woman and therefore, he believed that there had to be a reason behind the scene he had just witnessed.</p><p>Before Huo Mian made up her mind on how she should explain the situation to Ning Zhiyuan, Qin Chu suddenly opened his mouth and spoke, \"Huo Mian… is mine.\" </p><p>Upon hearing this, Huo Mian felt like her head was about to explode.</p><p>She never thought that something as cliché as this would ever happen to her. She suddenly felt like this was some kind of sick cosmic joke.</p><p>Having heard this declaration, the familiar tenderness drained away from Ning Zhiyuan's eyes, and it was replaced by an icy chill.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, what the hell are you talking about?\" Huo Mian was finally enraged.</p><p>\"Mian. First, you tell me. Just who is he?\" Ning Zhiyuan asked as he pointed at Qin Chu with a grim expression on his face.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, listen to me. He's just… my… high school classmate,\" Huo Mian's voice clearly wavered as she spoke. Technically, she wasn't lying. It was indeed true that Qin Chu was her classmate for three years back in high school. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, we were more than just classmates, weren't we? Why don't you tell him how we just kissed in the hotel bathroom?\" Qin Chu said cruelly, a haughty smile tugging at the corner of his lips. </p><p>Having heard this, Ning Zhiyuan's expression darkened. He felt his entire body going numb. </p><p>\"I didn't…\" Huo Mian struggled to correct Qin Chu's distorted version of the truth.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, don't lie. You can't lie about this when my scent is still on your lips.\" Qin Chu reached out and swept his forefinger across Huo Mian's lips in an extremely intimate and provocative motion.</p><p>Then, Qin Chu glanced over at Ning Zhiyuan again.</p><p>\"You are Huo Mian's boyfriend, but has she ever told you about her past?\" he asked.</p><p>Her past? Ning Zhiyuan thought in surprise. It was true, Huo Mian never once mentioned her past to him. Aside from still being close friends with Zhu Lingling, Huo Mian never attended any reunion-type of events, and he never asked her about it either.</p><p>\"What, you didn't know? Hasn't she ever mentioned that, seven years ago, there was a man she loved deeply? That person was me,\" Qin Chu said, enunciating each word. Huo Mian felt the old wound in her chest, long healed over, tearing open again with excruciating slowness.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, tell me, is what he said true?\" Ning Zhiyuan's voice was cold, no longer holding even a hint of warmth.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":8,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:41.667","Link":"Chapter-8","NameDisplay":"Chapter 8"},{"ID":181120947422434058,"Name":"Chapter 9: Cracks","NameUnsign":"Chapter 9: Cracks","Description":"<p>Chapter 9: Cracks</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"No, Zhiyuan, let me explain. It's not what you think it is!\" Usually, Huo Mian was a fairly composed woman. However, when it was about matters that touched upon the events from seven years ago, her mind would completely scramble to the point that she'd struggle to even form words. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, you're not a liar so why lie to him? You should tell him everything that happened between us back then.\" Qin Chu's tone was overbearing.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, let me ask you this. He's your ex-boyfriend, right? Did he, or did he not, just touch you? Did he kiss you? Well?\" Ning Zhiyuan walked towards Huo Mian. In all the time that she'd known him, this was her first time seeing him this serious. The expression in his eyes was nearly murderous.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and Huo Mian had been together for a while, but the most they'd ever done was hold hands and kiss; they have not gone all the way yet. Perhaps, it was because Huo Mian was a traditionalist at heart, and Ning Zhiyuan, with marriage in mind, had been willing to hold it off. Now, upon hearing that the woman he had worshiped as a goddess had been tainted by another, he could no longer hold back his rage.</p><p>A surge of unnameable fury soared up to Ning Zhiyuan's chest, leaving him so enraged that his face drained of color.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't want to lie to Ning Zhiyuan. She had been kissed against her will. However, if she told him the truth now, wouldn't it just deepen his misunderstanding?</p><p>Just as she struggled to figure out the best way to explain everything to Ning Zhiyuan so it'd be easy for him to understand, Qin Chu's voice rang out again, like that of the Devil out of Hell.</p><p>\"Looks like you didn't know that we slept together seven years ago either?\"</p><p>Qin Chu's words were like a bomb, completely shattering what little remained of Huo Mian's senses.</p><p>She would have never, in a million years, thought that Qin Chu would bring up what happened seven years ago so nonchalantly, and with such an indifferent expression on his face. This wasn't supposed to happen - it didn't feel like something Qin Chu would do. Had the last seven years turned him into another person altogether? </p><p>\"Qin Chu, when did you become so shameless…\" Stunned, Huo Mian could no longer form a complete sentence.</p><p>\"You bastard! What did you say?\" Ning Zhiyuan demanded, eyes red, as he grabbed Qin Chu's collar with one hand. The cola and grilled corn he had been holding were tossed aside.</p><p>A smile tugged at the corners of Qin Chu's lips as he glanced over at Huo Mian casually.</p><p>\"Looks like you two haven't gotten that far yet. It seems like Huo Mian doesn't actually like you that much, heh.\" </p><p>\"Asshole! What did you say? I'm going to f***ing kill you!\" With that, Ning Zhiyuan hurled his fist at Qin Chu's face.</p><p>Qin Chu, on the other hand, dodged aside with great agility. Immediately after, Ning Zhiyuan charged over and threw another punch. This time, it was too quick to react to, striking Qin Chu before he even saw it coming. </p><p>Qin Chu stumbled back several steps. Wiping a smudge of blood from the corner of his lips, he said in a cold voice, \"I'll take this punch since you've been taking care of Huo Mian for me for the last few years. But you're not going to get another chance.\"</p><p>\"Alright, then hit me back. Come on, asshole. What gives you the right to treat Mian like that? Even if you are her ex, it's all in the past. Why the hell did you come back looking for her?\" Ning Zhiyuan was nearly mad with rage. He had to admit that his mind shattered when he heard Qin Chu say that Huo Mian slept with him seven years ago.</p><p>Seven years ago. How old was Huo Mian then? Eighteen? She was still a naïve high school student...</p><p>No man could ever withstand being challenged by such a formidable adversary in a relationship. Ning Zhiyuan was no exception.</p><p>Ignoring Qin Chu's warning, he charged at him like a crazed beast.</p><p>This time, however, Qin Chu didn't dodge. Instead, he threw a punch at Ning Zhiyuan's face as he rushed at him, sending Ning Zhiyuan crashing to the ground.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":9,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:42.243","Link":"Chapter-9","NameDisplay":"Chapter 9"},{"ID":181120947428253676,"Name":"Chapter 10: Tragedy","NameUnsign":"Chapter 10: Tragedy","Description":"<p>Chapter 10: Tragedy</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Zhiyuan!

You immoral… woman. Don't touch me. You make me sick.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's face was now streaked with tears. She shook her head, hurt. \"I didn't, Zhiyuan. I didn't betray you. Please believe me. Those were all things that happened in the past. It's already over between him and me.\"</p><p>\"Believe you? About what? That you're still a virgin?\" Ning Zhiyuan mocked, wiping the blood off his bottom lip.</p><p>Huo Mian looked down, her lashes veiling her eyes. She didn't reply. </p><p>\"Why aren't you saying anything? Is he wrong? You're not going to tell me that you're still untouched, are you?\" Ning Zhiyuan demanded, his gaze full of disdain as he glared at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"No, he's right. I was with him seven years ago. But it's all in the past now! Zhiyuan, would you let me explain? I'll tell you everything that happened between us.\"</p><p>Pa! A sharp sound cut through the air as Ning Zhiyuan raised a hand and struck Huo Mian's left cheek hard. Immediately, a burning pain surged up where the slap had landed.</p><p>Beside them, Qin Chu's pupils contracted sharply. Deep in his eyes were hints of heartbreak. </p><p>She reached out to hold Ning Zhiyuan, but he pushed her aside. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, I thought you were a decent girl, someone I could grow old with. I truly wanted to marry you and build a life together. I never thought that you'd be one of those tramps. I must have been blind. To think that I spent so much time courting you in college, not daring to touch you like you were some kind of goddess, I've got to be f***ing blind!\" Ning Zhiyuan laughed. \"You f***ing played me, bitch!\" </p><p>\"Zhiyuan. You can hit me or curse at me all you like. None of that's important. You're hurt, let's go to the hospital first, alright?\"</p><p>Huo Mian stumbled to her feet, trying to help Ning Zhiyuan up, but he shoved her again.</p><p>\"Don't touch me, Huo Mian. Get your filthy hands off me. You're not taking me anywhere. Get lost! I never want to see you again. Get out of here!\" Finishing his bellowing rant, Ning Zhiyuan crawled up from the ground like an injured animal and took off. </p><p>Huo Mian stood in place, sobbing silently.</p><p>She didn't know why things had turned out like this. Hadn't fate tormented her enough? Didn't she already pay the price for what happened seven years ago?</p><p>Why force her like this? Why couldn't she just live like a normal person? All she wanted was to live an ordinary life, nothing more.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, come back to me. Marry me.\" Qin Chu's voice sounded from behind her, near-relentless. His statement was not a discussion, nor a plea. It was an order, one that didn't seem to have any room for objections. Huo Mian knew that the Qin Family had that kind of power. People from the Qin Family were privileged from birth, and in this city, they were virtually gods and could do whatever they wanted to. Seven years ago, she'd learned this the hard way, and brutally paid for her mistakes. It seemed that, like her, it wasn't over for Qin Chu either.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":10,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:42.827","Link":"Chapter-10","NameDisplay":"Chapter 10"},{"ID":181120947433462979,"Name":"Chapter 11: Investigation","NameUnsign":"Chapter 11: Investigation","Description":"<p>Chapter 11: Investigation</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian didn't remember how she got home.

The lingering pain on her cheek was the mark that Ning Zhiyuan's hand had just left behind.</p><p>They had known each other since college, and Ning Zhiyuan courted her for a very long time. It was only after careful consideration that she began dating him. He wasn't extremely outstanding, but he really had been good to Huo Mian.

Qin Chu's return seemed to have shaken everything into disarray.</p><p>After a while, she regained enough of her senses to check her cell phone.

I'll fill you in when I see you again. I'm okay, don't worry about me.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling replied a few seconds later.</p><p>\"Okay, as long as I know you're alright.

Who was to blame?</p><p>In the dark, Huo Mian softly sighed. She knew that some things couldn't be kept away forever. These were things that couldn't be evaded.</p><p>City outskirts, in the upper-class district-</p><p>A silver Audi R8 steered slowly onto the grounds of a majestic manor, and the dozen or so guards bowed towards his car in respect.</p><p>With a quiet squeal, the car slid to a stop before the front door of the manor and Qin Chu stepped out from the vehicle without an expression on his face. He opened the door and walked in.</p><p>Mrs. Qin immediately rose to her feet, smiling and saying, \"Chu, you're back. Your dad and I have been waiting for you to start dinner. Hurry, go wash your hands.\"</p><p>Qin Chu didn't respond. Instead, he walked straight into the dining room and sat down beside his father, Qin Yumin. He stared at his father with mixed emotions.</p><p>\"Dad, I have something to ask you.\"</p><p>\"What is it?\" Catching his son's less-than-amicable gaze, Qin Yumin felt a strange sense of unease.</p><p>\"Back then, in order to force Huo Mian and I apart, what did you two do to her family?\" </p><p>After Qin Chu finished with his question, both Qin Yumin's and Mrs. Qin's expressions had undergone a drastic change.</p><p>\"Chu, what… are you talking about?\" Mrs. Qin smiled stiffly.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't respond and continued to focus his unwavering gaze on his father, trying to find some answer on his face.</p><p>Qin Chu went abroad seven years ago and hadn't been back ever since. He didn't know what happened during that time.</p><p>However, earlier, he sensed a deep hatred in Huo Mian's tone. </p><p>He was smart enough to guess that his parents probably did something unscrupulous to Huo Mian's family.</p><p>Qin Yumin felt very uncomfortable under his own son's gaze.</p><p>A minute later, Qin Yumin lowered his eyes.

Picking up his cell phone, he dialed a number.</p><p>\"Check something out for me as soon as possible,\" he said and then promptly hung up.</p><p>Then, he slowly unlocked one of the drawers and took out a yellowing photograph.</p><p>There was a girl in the picture with a ponytail.

She wanted to explain to him what had happened yesterday.</p><p>At the Outpatient Ophthalmology Department -</p><p>When Huo Mian went in, she found He Man, one of the nurses, carefully bandaging the wound on Ning Zhiyuan's forehead.</p><p>\"Geez, how did this happen, Doctor Ning? How can you be so careless?\" The female nurse's voice was artificially high-pitched, in a way that made people uncomfortable.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan,\" Huo Mian called out softly by the door. </p><p>Both of them turned around to face her. Ning Zhiyuan's expression was blank as his gaze fell upon Huo Mian. There was no telling what he was thinking of. </p><p>\"Ah, Huo Mian, you're here. You two go on and chat, I'll leave.\"</p><p>\"Don't go.\" Ning Zhiyuan suddenly reached out and grabbed He Man. \"Finish patching up my wound.\"</p><p>\"Doctor Ning, um… you should really let your girlfriend tend to you,\" He Man said as she chuckled awkwardly.</p><p>Huo Mian wanted to say something, but before she could, she heard Ning Zhiyuan spat out word by word, \"She is not my girlfriend anymore.\"</p><p>\"What did you say?\" Huo Mian's slightly frowned. </p><p>\"I said, we broke up yesterday. You're not my girlfriend anymore, and I'm not worthy of an upper-class girlfriend like you. So why don't you go find your super rich ex-boyfriend?

You already slept with someone seven years ago... how old were you back then? Eighteen? Huo Mian, I finally see how shameless you are. No wonder you chose to date me ... it seems like I was getting someone else's leftovers.\"</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan purposely emphasized the word 'leftovers' ...</p><p>Even Nurse He Man, a bystander, turned to look at Huo Mian with shock and disbelief. Although Huo Mian was faced with Ning Zhiyuan's cruel words, she felt more disappointed than hurt.</p><p>She could not believe that such insidious words would come from the mouth of a man who looked so gentle and kind...</p><p>Huo Mian gave Ning Zhiyuan a disappointed look before slowly saying, \"Zhiyuan, everyone has a past. What happened between me and Qin Chu is already history...\"</p><p>\"Shut up and stop showing off your ex-boyfriend. I find him disgusting. Who does he think he is? Does driving an Audi R8 make him cool? If you like him so much, why don't you go make up with him and leave me alone?\"</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, you may not be calm right now and I know that you are angry. When people are angry, they make irrational decisions and end up regretting it. I'll give you time to calm down and we can talk later.\"</p><p>After speaking, Huo Mian turned around and left...</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was a little distressed...</p><p>He courted Huo Mian for a whole three years, surprising everyone at their medical school. He had indeed fallen in love with her, but he could never accept his fiancee's disgraceful past.</p><p>Not to mention that her ex-boyfriend dared to brag about it and even kissed her yesterday.</p><p>He and Huo Mian had been together for so long, yet they've never slept together. All this new information about her past was not easy to process.</p><p>\"Doctor Ning, I can't believe that Huo Mian is so frivolous. What a shame,\" He Man</p><p>muttered under her breath.</p><p>\"Why is that a shame?\" Ning Zhiyuan frowned lightly.</p><p>\"A shame that a man like you went to waste, of course. So many nurses in our department think you're a great catch,\" He Man said with a smile on her face.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan pursed his lips...</p><p>Truth be told, Ning Zhiyuan was quite attractive and looked somewhat like the main character from a Korean drama. In big hospitals like this, most attending physicians were middle-aged men in their forties. Younger doctors were rare and, therefore, were much more popular.</p><p>Many nurses had confessed their feelings to him in the past, but he already had Huo Mian.

I feel like you've been distracted all day,\" the new nurse, Huang Yue, asked with a hint of concern.</p><p>Exhausted, Huo Mian shook her head.</p><p>She had been listless this entire day. What was worse was that it wasn't even because of the cold-war situation with Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p>She had been thinking about the man that she shouldn't be thinking about. </p><p>Was he really back? What happened last night wasn't a dream, was it?</p><p>Her daze lasted until her shift ended. Huo Mian changed from her white nurse's uniform into a pastel-blue dress. Grabbing her bag, she walked out.</p><p>She was just in time to catch sight of Ning Zhiyuan's white Chevrolet, which was parked outside of the front entrance.</p><p>He had just bought it last month. Since they were planning on getting married, Ning Zhiyuan's parents had helped pay for the car. This, along with their own salaries, summed up to over a hundred thousand Yuan. It was a pretty good-looking ride.</p><p>The license plate read 0510, which was Ning Zhiyuan's birthday. It was him for sure.</p><p>Did he stop here to wait for her?</p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to walk over and ask, she saw He Man, who was wearing a miniskirt. She sprinted over to the car and, after quickly opening the door, hopped onto the passenger seat. </p><p>Then, the car sped off...</p><p>Light drained from Huo Mian's eyes, bit by bit. She unhurriedly pulled out her cell phone and made a call.</p><p>\"What is it?\" On the other end, Ning Zhiyuan sounded annoyed.</p><p>\"Is your shift over? I need a ride home.\" </p><p>\"Not yet. I have another surgery. I'll be working overtime so you can go home first. Don't call me for no reason. Bye.\"</p><p>With that, Ning Zhiyuan hung up the phone.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled wryly; she knew why Ning Zhiyuan was lying. He was trying to get revenge on her.</p><p>However, what he did was just low.</p><p>Huo Mian suddenly got the feeling that the ordinary man she had dated for three years was no longer ordinary.</p><p>She looked up at the sky. It was grey, just like her mood.</p><p>Then, Zhu Lingling called...</p><p>\"Mian, are you off work now?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"Come to my place, I'm off today and made something yummy for you. It's marinated pork trotters!\"</p><p>\"That's good, I happen to be hungry too. Wait for me.\" Hanging up, Huo Mian flagged down a cab and headed towards Zhu Lingling's home.</p><p>Zhu Lingling's parents lived by the city outskirts. To make her commute to work easier, she had rented a cozy little place near the airport.</p><p>Whenever she had the time, Huo Mian would go over to mooch off her food. It seemed that, aside from home and the hospital, that was the only place she could go.</p><p>Setting the pork trotters on the table, Zhu Lingling began rambling off before Huo Mian even had the chance to eat. She was asking about what happened yesterday.</p><p>Unable to bear the bombardment, Huo Mian recounted the events for her in a relatively detailed fashion…</p><p>Of course, she kept some of the more provocative details, such as the forced kiss, to herself, only brushing over them.</p><p>\"That's what happened. You're welcome to comment, Miss Zhu Lingling.\"</p><p>Huo Mian stared at Zhu Lingling with pursed lips and big wet doe-eyes. It was a cute look.</p><p>\"Gosh, that's intense. So, what you're saying is Mr. Blueblood Qin Chu proposed to you yesterday?\" Zhu Lingling stared back at her with a look of surprise.</p><p>\"Girl, please. That's not the issue here. The issue is that Zhiyuan doesn't trust me anymore and wants to break up...\" Huo Mian complained.</p><p>\"Mian, tell me the truth.

It was a while before she finally responded, \"What does it matter if I love him or not? Things happened. There's no taking them back, and there's no changing how things turned out.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling heard a heavy melancholy in Huo Mian's voice. She felt a genuine pang of heartache for her friend.</p><p>\"Mian, when we were in high school, the fact that you and Qin Chu got together was what made me believe that fairy tales can be real. You were both such outstanding people ... how did it ever get to where it is today? It's such a pity. I'm going to say something, but you can't get mad. I've always felt like Ning Zhiyuan wasn't good enough for you. I mean, back in school, you were…\"</p><p>Huo Mian cut Zhu Lingling short before she could finish.</p><p>\"Lingling, stop. It's all in the past. No matter how I feel about Qin Chu, there's no way we can ever be together again. You know what happened, that incident seven years ago, and what it did to me. I've already lost my family. What could be worse than that? I really wish that I was the one who died back then.\"</p><p>At this point, Huo Mian's voice caught in her throat.</p><p>Zhu Lingling was aware of what happened. It was that incident which made Huo Mian hide away her radiant aura, resigning to become a hobbling member of the common masses.</p><p>Zhu Lingling placed a hand on Huo Mian's shoulder and comforted, \"Mian, listen to me. It's been so long so stop blaming yourself. Haven't you been trying to make up for it all these years? I don't think you can place all the blame on Qin Chu either. You know very well that he had been out of the country for years. Considering how he felt about you, I don't think there's any way he could have known about what happened.\"</p><p>\"So what? He's still a member of the Qin Family, isn't he? Can he really shake off all the blame for what his family did?\" Huo Mian's eyes were red as she demanded.</p><p>\"Mian...\" Zhu Lingling seemed to want to say more.</p><p>However, she was cut short when she saw Huo Mian raise a hand. \"Lingling, you don't have to say anything else. You're my best friend, and I know that you're just telling me what you think is best for me, but… you can't possibly understand the things I've experienced. Let me make up my own mind about this, okay?\"</p><p>\"Alright, I just hope that, whatever you decide, you don't wrong yourself. I've seen how hard the past few years have been for you. I really wish that you could return to being the high-and-mighty Huo Mian from before, the one who wouldn't let anyone else influence her.\"</p><p>Huo Mian smiled bitterly but didn't reply.</p><p>All she wanted was to have a good time eating pork trotters. However, with the heavy subject of Qin Chu hanging in the air, she no longer had an appetite.</p><p>She barely touched the food before quickly leaving her friend's place.</p><p>On her way back, she wondered if she should call Ning Zhiyuan again. After all, she was in the wrong first.</p><p>Just as she pulled out her phone and was about to dial, it rang.</p><p>The caller ID displayed her little brother's number.</p><p>She picked up immediately, \"Zhixin.\" </p><p>\"Sis, hurry. You need to come to the hospital. Mom collapsed.\" On the other end, Jing Zhixin's voice was wrought with anxiety.</p><p>\"What? Mom collapsed? How? Which hospital? I'll head over right now.\"</p><p>\"We're at the Fourth People's Hospital, the one near home. Come to the seventh floor, room 709.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll be right there.\" </p><p>Hanging up, Huo Mian's expression was distressed. \"Sir, please turn around and go to the Fourth People's Hospital!\"</p><p>Twenty minutes later-</p><p>Huo Mian rushed up the stairs and barged through the doors of a hospital room.</p><p>Her mother was lying on a bed, still unconscious. Her face was pale, and she was wearing an oxygen mask.</p><p>Beside her was a boy in his late teens wearing a black Nike tracksuit. His hair was a bit long and his facial features were rather delicate.</p><p>He was Huo Mian's half-brother, Jing Zhixin, and they were related on their mother's side.</p><p>\"Sis, you're here.\"</p><p>\"Zhixin, what happened to mom?

She said that our mom fainted in front of her convenience store. I told the teacher that I had to leave, called for an ambulance, and came right away.\"</p><p>\"Mom's always been fairly healthy. How did this happen?\" Huo Mian was sick with worry.</p><p>Just then, the door opened and a doctor walked in. \"Which of you is Yang Meirong's family member? Come outside for a minute.\"</p><p>\"I am.\" Huo Mian hurriedly followed the doctor outside.</p><p>\"You're the patient's daughter, right?\" The doctor made a guess based on Huo Mian's age. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>\"Were you aware that the patient suffers from high blood pressure?\" questioned the doctor harshly.</p><p>\"I know, but my mother has been taking her medications, and she had been making sure that she gets enough rest. I check her blood pressure whenever I have the time, and it's been fairly stable for a while now.\"</p><p>\"Our guess is that the patient suffered from some kind of shock, resulting in heightened blood pressure. As her children, you really need to be more careful. The patient has heart problems on top of high blood pressure. If this keeps happening, it'll cost the patient her life. Do you understand?\"</p><p>\"Suffered a shock?\" Huo Mian was surprised.</p><p>She was busy with her job, and only went home once every two weeks. Her little brother was a good kid, so what else could have been the trigger?</p><p>\"When the patient wakes up, you can ask her yourself. We recommend that she stay at the hospital for a week to regulate her blood pressure. What do you think?\"</p><p>\"Not a problem.\" A nurse herself, Huo Mian didn't dare to take chances. She knew how serious the condition was.</p><p>\"Okay, you can go pay the hospitalization fees now.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded. Then, she hurried downstairs and headed towards the cashier's stall on the first floor.</p><p>\"The total comes to 7908 yuan.\" </p><p>\"That much?\" Huo Mian's expression was troubled. Over these past few years, half of the money she had earned was spent on her brother, and the other half had gone towards the down payment for the house she had bought with Ning Zhiyuan. She only had three thousand yuan left in her bank account. Now, they were asking for more than seven thousand, all at once. She really didn't have that much money.</p><p>\"Are you paying or not? Hurry up, there are people behind you. Don't hold up the line.\"</p><p>\"I'll pay.\" Huo Mian hurriedly took out her credit card. She had gotten the card last year, and she remembered that its spending limit was ten thousand yuan.</p><p>Having paid the fees, she went back to the hospital room. By then, her mother had woken up.</p><p>\"Mom, you're awake,\" Huo Mian said carefully. </p><p>\"What did you come here for? Get lost!\" Yang Meirong seemed extremely upset to see Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Mom, I was the one who called Sis.\" Jing Zhixin rushed up and tried to calm her down.</p><p>\"You don't need to come and see me. I'm not sick, I don't need to stay at a hospital. Zhixin, go fill out the discharge forms. We're going home.\"</p><p>Yang Meirong was insistent on getting out of bed.</p><p>\"Mom, your condition is rather serious. They need to get your blood pressure down first. You have to stay here for a week before you can be discharged.\"</p><p>\"It's none of your business. Whose fault is it that I ended up this way?\" Yang Meirong roared. \"Our family would have never ended up like this if it weren't for you, you accursed thing!\"</p><p>\"Mom, don't say that. It's not Sis's fault.\"</p><p>\"Shut up.\" Yang Meirong was clearly very worked up. \"This accursed thing killed your dad with her bad luck, and now that damned man is back too. He came to our home and strutted about, thinking he's almighty just because he has money. Compensation? That's a neat way of putting it. Who wants his stinking money? Can his money bring the dead back to life?\"</p><p>At that, Huo Mian felt her heart sink as she finally seemed to understand what happened. \"Mom, did … Qin Chu come looking for you?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":16,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:45.983","Link":"Chapter-16","NameDisplay":"Chapter 16"},{"ID":181120947464391594,"Name":"Chapter 17: Rage","NameUnsign":"Chapter 17: Rage","Description":"<p>Chapter 17: Rage</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You have the audacity to ask me that?

Over these seven years, no one had been more bereft than her. </p><p>At this thought, she fell silent. Turning around, she pushed open the door and left. </p><p>\"Sis, I'll walk you out.\"</p><p>Jing Zhixin followed her out, knowing that his sister must be feeling down.</p><p>\"Sis, Mom just has a bad temper. Don't think about what she said. She's been like this for a few years now. Besides, from what I read, women her age can get menopausal. That's what's happening to Mom for sure.\"</p><p>\"Oh, squirt, what kinds of books have you been reading?\" Huo Mian looked at her brother, both mad and amused.</p><p>\"Sis, don't worry about what's happening here. I'll take care of mom. Go do whatever you have to do.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded. \"I'll call off work tomorrow and come to take care of her, you should go back to school tomorrow. Oh, and here's the money to cover your living expenses for next month. Take it.\"</p><p>Huo Mian pulled out a thousand yuan in cash from her purse and handed it to her brother.</p><p>\"Sis, I don't need it. I still have money left from last month. Besides, I'm working part-time at school, so you don't have to give me money anymore. You're getting married, and there's going to be plenty of things that you and Zhiyuan will need money for.\"</p><p>\"Take it. Even if I'm getting married, I can still spare a little bit to give to you. Zhixin, I know you're concerned for me, so you've been careful of where you spend your money. But, you can't pinch money where it's meant to be spent. You're still a growing boy and need to eat properly.\" With that, Huo Mian rubbed the top of her brother's head affectionately.</p><p>\"I know, Sis. You too.\"</p><p>Huo Mian left the hospital with a heavy heart.</p><p>She hadn't expected Qin Chu to find her mother and brother so quickly. What was he trying to do?</p><p>Perhaps, they really needed to talk... </p><p>Taking out her cell phone, she pulled out her call history. That unfamiliar number ending with 8866 was definitely his.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, she made the call.</p><p>As soon as the call went through, Huo Mian began questioning angrily, \"Hey, Qin Chu. What in the world do you want from me?\" </p><p>\"I'm sorry, President Qin is in a meeting. May I ask who is calling?\" An unfamiliar man's voice came from over the line. </p><p>Caught by surprise, Huo Mian didn't speak.</p><p>\"I'm President Qin's assistant, Yang. May I take a message for him?\"</p><p>\"No, thank you,\" she replied coldly and then hung up.</p><p>GK Headquarters, inside the executive meeting room- </p><p>Qin Chu was wearing a black dress shirt that was custom-made in Italy with cuffs adorned with luxurious diamonds.

The atmosphere seemed to be a little tense.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Chu opened his mouth and said, \"That case? I've already rejected it.\"</p><p>\"Huh? Rejected it? Why would you do that, President Qin? It took our department three months to draft a proposal after spending the last year working out the budget and business metrics. It'll profit for sure, and has already been approved by the Chairman.\"</p><p>When Qin Chu heard those words, he raised his head and unconcernedly looked at the director of Land Development before saying, \"GK is in my hands now and I don't need to justify my decisions.

Where are you?\"</p><p>\"You don't need to do that. Meet me at Café en Seine on Half-Mountain Road.\"</p><p>\"Alright, I'll head over right now.\"</p><p>Hanging up, Qin Chu's lips perched up into a smile.

Huo Mian was already waiting inside. </p><p>From afar, he saw her sitting by the window.</p><p>He could only see the side of her face, but the sight of her had already given him butterflies in his stomach nonetheless.</p><p>For the past seven years, she was constantly on his mind, and the thought of her almost drove him to insanity...</p><p>He suppressed the urges in his heart and slowly walked in...</p><p>Huo Mian was dressed simply. Before meeting Qin Chu, she returned to her apartment to change.</p><p>She was wearing plain white pants and a yellow tee; the look was simple but poised.</p><p>Huo Mian was also too lazy for makeup unless it was for special occasions. She felt that rubbing chemicals on her face made it sticky, and since it didn't seem to have anti-aging effects, she'd rather not go through all that trouble.</p><p>Qin Chu strode over and sat down in front of her...</p><p>Huo Mian's thoughts snapped back to reality and she calmly said, \"What do you want to drink?\"</p><p>\"I'll have whatever you are having,\" he answered.</p><p>\"But I'm drinking water.\"</p><p>\"Then I'll drink water too,\" he insisted.</p><p>Huo Mian felt helpless as she waved the waiter over, and said, \"Excuse me, can he get a cup of water?\"</p><p>Turning back around, she glared at the face in front of her, ever so familiar yet distant, before slowly opening her mouth.</p><p>\"Qin Chu.\"</p><p>\"Mhm.\"</p><p>\"Let's talk.\"</p><p>\"Sure.\"</p><p>\"What do you want from me?\"</p><p>\"I want us to go back to what we were before,\" Qin Chu blurted out without a second thought.</p><p>\"Ha, that's impossible, Qin Chu.

Did he not find a girlfriend while he was abroad?</p><p>Her thoughts started to run wild...</p><p>She was pulled back to reality when she heard the doorknob turning.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan pushed open the door and walked in, unsurprised that Huo Mian was home.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, you're back. Did you eat yet?\"</p><p>\"Mhm,\" he answered with a strange expression on his face before heading into his bedroom.</p><p>He ignored Huo Mian, who was sitting on the couch in the living room...</p><p>Huo Mian followed him in, \"Did you have a lot of surgeries today? Are you tired?\"</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan didn't answer; but rather, he opened the closet and began packing.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, what are you doing?\"</p><p>\"I won't be living here from now on,\" he said with a cold tone.</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"Because I don't want to see your face.\" His answer was simple and vicious.</p><p>Huo Mian fell silent...</p><p>\"I am going to live in the new place, and I will leave the furniture and appliances here. I don't plan on returning your part of the down payment. I've spent enough on you over the past three years, so I'll count the down payment as payback. From now on, we don't owe each other anything.\"</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, money's not the problem.\"</p><p>\"But the problem is that I have no money. Haha, how rich is your ex? He's the prince of the GK business empire, isn't he? Huo Mian, I've really underestimated you. You have such a powerful ex-boyfriend, so what are you doing with me? Were you just using me to pass the time?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":19,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:47.42","Link":"Chapter-19","NameDisplay":"Chapter 19"},{"ID":181120947479047658,"Name":"Chapter 20: Unworthy","NameUnsign":"Chapter 20: Unworthy","Description":"<p>Chapter 20: Unworthy</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Judged by the way Ning Zhiyuan spoke, he seemed to know already who Qin Chu was.</p><p>In fact, it wouldn't have been hard to figure it out. Qin Chu's name appeared on finance newspapers and TV shows quite frequently these days.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, I spoke with him today, and I'm never going to see him again,\" Huo Mian explained patiently. \"I just want to be with you. Don't be upset anymore, okay?\"</p><p>\"Like I'd believe any more of your bullshit. Do you still think I'm going to marry you? I would have to be insane! What, am I just going to wait for you to have your little affair after the wedding?\" With that, Ning Zhiyuan picked up his leather suitcase bitterly and headed towards the door.</p><p>Huo Mian reached out to stop him. \"Zhiyuan, have you calmed down? Did you really mean what you just said?\" she asked again.</p><p>\"Get out of my way! I don't want to talk to you. If you ask me, I think it's better for you to quit your job. After all, it wouldn't be good for us to work at the same hospital anyways. I'm a doctor, so I'm naturally not going to quit. You're just a nurse without much prospect, so why don't you just go find your ex-boyfriend and live the high life?\"</p><p>With that, Ning Zhiyuan angrily shook off Huo Mian's hand, shoved open the door, and left...</p><p>As she watched Ning Zhiyuan walked away, Huo Mian was surprised that she didn't feel the slightest bit of sadness.</p><p>It was as if she could finally let out the breath that she had been holding for a long time. But… how could that be the case?</p><p>She was left dumbstruck by her own realization...</p><p>A moment later, she took out her cell phone and sent a WeChat message to Zhu Lingling.</p><p>\"Lingling, what are you doing right now?\"</p><p>\"I just got off a flight, and I'm eating instant noodles right now.\"</p><p>\"Come out for a drink, my boyfriend and I just broke up. I should be upset, right?\"</p><p>\"Ahem… You guys broke up? What happened? Did Qin Chu leave the country again?\"</p><p>\"Please, girl. My current boyfriend is Ning Zhiyuan.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that guy. You should've gotten rid of him long ago. He wasn't good enough for you anyways.\"</p><p>\"Alright, stop blabbing. Are you coming?\"</p><p>\"Of course! You find a place, and I'll be right there.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's best friend, Zhu Lingling, was indeed true to her words. Twenty minutes later, she arrived at Dark Night Bar.</p><p>As a flight attendant, her appeal was unquestionable, and the skin-tight black dress she wore made her look especially alluring.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, didn't look like someone who was enjoying a night out at all. In fact, she looked more like a waitress.</p><p>\"Come on, we're out to play. Can't you dress up a little? Don't be like an old maid.\"</p><p>Huo Mian smiled, \"I've never had that many clothes to begin with.\"</p><p>Over the past few years, half of her salary had gone to support her brother in his studies, and the other half had been saved to buy a home with Ning Zhiyuan. She didn't spend much money on herself.</p><p>It was true that she didn't have a lot of nice clothes. Even the dress she had worn to the high school reunion originally belonged to Zhu Lingling. Zhu Lingling bought it a while ago but then decided that she didn't want to wear it, so she gave it to Huo Mian.</p><p>For such a beautiful young girl of only twenty-four years old, she really hadn't indulged in the finer things in life.</p><p>\"Mian, leaving Ning Zhiyuan is no big deal. He's doesn't know what he's losing. You know what they say, some people don't know a good thing when they see it. He's blind, and that's why he left you.\"</p><p>\"Don't say that. I'm not as perfect as you think,\" Huo Mian said quietly as she picked up her cocktail glass.</p><p>\"Says who? As far as I can see, you're one of a kind. You're a genius with an IQ of 130——\"</p><p>\"Okay, stop.\" Huo Mian quickly interrupted her before she had the chance to finish. \"I swear you're going to keep bringing that up for the rest of our lives.\"</p><p>However, what Zhu Lingling said wasn't wrong. Huo Mian was twenty-four, yet all her classmates were twenty-seven or twenty-eight. This was because she'd skipped three grades.</p><p>Besides, she was admitted into C City's 2nd High School, an exclusive academy for the elite, with a grade of 697.</p><p>The exam had 700 points in total. At the time, it had been quite the event and she was even featured on the newspaper.</p><p>Her stepfather was still alive back then. That night, the whole family went to celebrate at a five-star hotel to enjoy a luxurious buffet.</p><p>Now, everything was different...</p><p>If she didn't date Qin Chu, she wouldn't have incurred the wrath of the Qin Family, and her stepfather wouldn't have been killed.</p><p>Her future should have been a bright one as well. In her second year of high school, she received an acceptance letter from the top school in America, with a full scholarship.</p><p>However, she rejected several opportunities in order to be with Qin Chu, yet what she had gotten in return was a death in her family and a broken home.</p><p>Right then, she heard a voice, disrupting her thought.</p><p>\"Hi, Huo Mian, it's been a while.\"</p><p>She turned her head and was caught by surprise when she saw the man's face.</p><p>\"Why are you here?\" Huo Mian's attitude took on an antagonistic edge.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":20,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:47.907","Link":"Chapter-20","NameDisplay":"Chapter 20"},{"ID":181120947484208148,"Name":"Chapter 21: Identity","NameUnsign":"Chapter 21: Identity","Description":"<p>Chapter 21: Identity</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You look surprised.\" Huo Siqian smiled. Dressed in a white shirt and a pair of black pants, he looked graceful and sophisticated.</p><p>However, for some reason, Huo Mian inexplicably disliked this person. It was a feeling even stronger than what she felt towards Huo Yanyan and Huo Siyi.</p><p>As for how they were related, it was just a hot mess...</p><p>When Huo Mian's mother, Yang Meirong, was wrong, she was a barely-famous C-list actress who specialized in historical period dramas. Although she wasn't necessarily drop-dead gorgeous, she was pretty enough and, riding on the arrogance of youth, made some bad choices. At one point, she was one of the mistresses of Huo Zhenghai, the heir of the illustrious Huo Family. She thought that, once she bears him a child, she could replace his wife. What she hadn't counted on was that both she and her daughter would be kicked to the curb.</p><p>The Huo Family never acknowledged her illegitimate daughter, Huo Mian, either.</p><p>Huo Siqian was the current heir of the Huo Family. As an adopted child of Huo Zhenghai's wife, Mrs. Huo, who was also known as the tigress, he had her full support. Therefore, even though he wasn't Huo Zhenghai's biological child, he still enjoyed a high status within the family.</p><p>On the other hand, his siblings, Huo Yanyan and Huo Siyu, were the children of Huo Zhenghai's favorite mistress, Shen Jiani, and were doted upon by their father.</p><p>Back in the day, Shen Jiani had enjoyed momentary fame as a celebrity. She managed to rise above all the other mistresses by taking advantage of various means and her intellect.</p><p>Right now, the Huo Family only publically acknowledged these three successors. As for Huo Mian, no one knew about her aside from members of the Huo Family themselves.</p><p>Huo Siqian had checked on Huo Mian a few times on his own. He tried to give her money, but she never accepted it.</p><p>As far as she was concerned, aside from her last name, she had no further connection to the Huo Family.</p><p>She never thought of that man as her father either.</p><p>She would rather give more of her love to her stepdad, Uncle Jing.</p><p>\"Why would I be surprised? It's quite normal for someone like Young Master Huo to be at a place like this.\" Huo Mian gave him a humorless smile. \"Rather, shouldn't it surprise you more to see us common folk here?\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, you seem to have something against me. Why is that? From what I remember, I've been fairly nice to you. Besides,\" glass in hand, Huo Siqian moved closer to Huo Mian and continued, \"based on our positions within the family, you should really be calling me 'big brother'.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling sat next to Huo Mian, listening quietly. It wasn't really her place to say anything.</p><p>\"Young Master Huo must be joking. You are the heir of the great Huo family and I'm just some commoner. By what logic should we be addressing each other as siblings? As for me having something against you, well, you are right. Did you know? There are people in this world that you really just hate from the moment you lay eyes on them. Well, it just so happens that that's how I feel about you.\"</p><p>When Huo Mian finished, she turned away from Huo Siqian, not paying him any more attention. She touched her glass to Zhu Lingling's.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, he went on trying to make small talk with Huo Mian. \"Dad hasn't been well lately. If you have time, you should go see him.\"</p><p>\"Let me know when he leaves this world for good. On the account that he donated some swimmers to my creation twenty-four years ago, I'd be willing to light some incense sticks by his grave.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's comment left Huo Siqian speechless...</p><p>His face darkened and, unwilling to invite more abuse onto himself, he turned around and left.</p><p>After Huo Siqian walked away, Zhu Lingling cried out with her palm against her mouth, \"My gosh! Girl, that was amazing! There's the Huo Mian I know! You showed no mercy, not even to your brother.\"</p><p>\"What brother? I never acknowledged him.\" Feeling a bit glum, Huo Mian took another sip of her drink.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":21,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:48.423","Link":"Chapter-21","NameDisplay":"Chapter 21"},{"ID":181120947489353863,"Name":"Chapter 22: Wager","NameUnsign":"Chapter 22: Wager","Description":"<p>Chapter 22: Wager</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Damn, it feels good watching you squabble with people. You've still got that razor-sharp tongue of yours, just as sharp as it was back in the day,\" Zhu Lingling laughed, \"I think this stubbornness of yours must have been why Qin Chu fell in love with you in the first place.\" At this, Zhu Lingling seemed to realize that she had said the wrong thing. She coughed, taking the conversation in another direction, \"What I mean is, even Young Master Huo got a verbal lashing from you. You're amazing. Teach me your ways, great master!\"</p><p>\"I'm done taking apprentices,\" Huo Mian joked while giving off a big smile.</p><p>\"Look at you, acting all cheeky. Humph! Like you've actually taken apprentices before,\" Zhu Lingling teased back.</p><p>Time spent messing about with girlfriends always passed quickly.</p><p>The two would never cause trouble at night-time establishments. By the time they finished their drinks, it was already late into the night. They each took a separate cab home.</p><p>Arriving back at her rented apartment, Huo Mian changed into a nightgown and messaged Zhu Lingling.</p><p>\"I'm home, Lingling, what about you?\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling replied almost instantly, \"Got home safe. I'm going to take a shower. Go to bed soon, good night!\"</p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to turn her phone off, she received a text message. The number ended with 8866, which she recognized to be Qin Chu's.</p><p>\"Asleep yet?\"</p><p>Two simple words. However, without knowing why, Huo Mian felt her heart thundering in her chest. It had been seven years since she last felt like this. It was strange, really.</p><p>After a moment of thought, she promptly deleted the message, turned off the phone, and went to bed.</p><p>On the other end of the line, at the Hillside Manor-</p><p>Not seeing a reply after a while, Qin Chu realized that he wasn't going to receive anything tonight. Knowing Huo Mian's personality, there was no way she would text him back.</p><p>Getting up, he walked down the stairs. Stopping before the wine rack, he picked out a bottle of red wine.</p><p>Just then, heavy footsteps sounded from behind him. Without needing to ask, he had a rough idea of who it was.</p><p>\"Chu, come here for a second. I have something to ask you.\"</p><p>Qin Yumin hadn't been sleeping well lately. Waking up in the middle of the night, he heard movement coming from downstairs, so he went down to investigate. As he had guessed, his son wasn't asleep yet either.</p><p>Qin Chu unhurriedly poured himself a glass of wine, then walked to the living room and sat down on the couch. With his head lowered, he gently swirled his glass.</p><p>The navy-blue night robe he wore showed off his sculpted face perfectly. His eyes lowered, and his long fingers were tapping intermittently on the side of the wine glass. It was a sight that could intoxicate any woman.</p><p>Seeing his son in this light, Qin Yumin felt a strange absence of familiarity.</p><p>\"I heard about the meeting today. You dismissed the Greenfield Manor Plan?\"</p><p>\"I did.\" His answer was extremely straightforward.</p><p>\"Why?\" Qin Yumin demanded, slightly enraged.</p><p>\"I don't like it.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense. Business isn't done based on likes and dislikes. If that were the case, GK would have gone bankrupt long ago. Chu, I handed GK over to you because I believe in you, but you can't be so reckless.\"</p><p>\"I have my reasons for what I did. If you don't trust me, then do it yourself. You know that I've never had any interest in a boring job like this in the first place.\"</p><p>\"You…\" Qin Yumin was left speechless with rage.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Chu suddenly raised his head, his eyes catching the light for a moment. \"Dad, do you still remember our wager from seven years ago?\" he asked.</p><p>At this, Qin Yumin paused for a moment but remained silent.</p><p>Seven years ago, he had made a bet with his son, a wager on a very important matter.</p><p>\"What are you trying to say?\" Frowned, Qin Yumin asked Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Not much. I just wanted to remind you that I've done everything you requested, so isn't it time for you to return the favor?\"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Yumin's expression darkened.</p><p>However, in the end, he only said this, \"I don't care how, but I want this quarter's performance improved by 15 percent. Otherwise, the Greenfield Project will commence, and you will be demoted,\" he huffed. \"Don't think that, just because you're my son, I can't do anything to you.\"</p><p>With that, Qin Yumin turned brusquely and left. It was easy to see that he was angry.</p><p>Although he didn't say a word about the promise from seven years ago, Qin Chu knew that his father understood what he meant.</p><p>As for GK's performance, he thought, I can raise it by fifteen percent with my eyes closed. I wonder why Father brought up such an unchallenging task so solemnly.</p><p>At five in the morning, Qin Chu was woken by a series of noises.</p><p>At the door stood a middle-aged man in a black suit. Behind him were eight members of the Special Police Unit, with their guns in hand.</p><p>\"Doctor Qin, sorry to disturb you. There's been an emergency and we really need you right now.\"</p><p>His mother and father were shocked and confused. On the other hand, Qin Chu's expression was calm. \"Give me a minute to change.\" With that, he turned around and walked upstairs, hands tucked inside his pockets.</p><p>After her son left, Mrs. Qin asked, pale and trembling, \"Yumin, our son... did he get in trouble with someone important?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":22,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:48.937","Link":"Chapter-22","NameDisplay":"Chapter 22"},{"ID":181120947495405433,"Name":"Chapter 23: In Need of Money","NameUnsign":"Chapter 23: In Need of Money","Description":"<p>Chapter 23: In Need of Money</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian didn't get much sleep the night before. With big dark-circles under her eyes, she got up and made some plain congee and two omelet rolls, which she took with her to the Fourth People's Hospital.</p><p>It was a good thing that she worked the night shift today and was therefore free during the day. Although she was tired, she couldn't let Zhixin neglect his studies to take care of their mother.</p><p>\"Mom, I brought you some food.\"</p><p>\"Get it out of here. I'm not eating it.\" Yang Meirong was still throwing a tantrum.</p><p>\"Even if your appetite isn't that good, you should still have some. It's really good. I made it myself, and I guarantee it's clean. I'll leave it right here.\"</p><p>Leaving the breakfast on the table, Huo Mian tidied up a bit and walked out of the room.</p><p>After Huo Mian left, Yang Meirong scanned the food on the table, and her stomach gave a traitorous growl.</p><p>She glanced over at the door. Seeing that Huo Mian hadn't returned, she immediately picked up the food and dug right in.</p><p>In truth, although Yang Meirong had a rotten temper, she wasn't a bad person. It wasn't that she really disliked her daughter, either. It was jsut that, she was still not over her late husband's untimely death.</p><p>In the doctor's office-</p><p>\"Doctor, has my mother gotten any better?\" Huo Mian asked anxiously.</p><p>\"Her conditions have clearly improved. We'll be able to discharge her in a few more days. However, even then, she needs to continue taking her blood-pressure medication.\"</p><p>\"Alright, thank you.\" Hearing that her mother was alright, Huo Mian was finally able to let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\"But the hospitalization fee you paid isn't enough to cover the costs anymore, you need to pay up soon,\" the doctor reminded her.</p><p>Huo Mian was a little surprised since she paid seven thousand yuan for the hospital fees just the other day. Yet, just a few days later, it was all gone. Oh dear…</p><p>She already maxed out her credit card the other day. Adding that to the living expenses she had given to Zhixin, she was pretty much broke.</p><p>If this was before they broke up, she could have just borrowed some money from Ning Zhiyuan. However, with the way things were now, there wasn't much hope for that.</p><p>Left with no choice, she called Zhu Lingling, who immediately transferred over 10,000 yuan from the banking app on her phone.</p><p>\"Lingling, thank you!\" A little embarrassed, she messaged her friend.</p><p>\"Don't say that. If you need more, just tell me. Your mother's health is what's important. Don't worry about the money.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling's reply warmed Huo Mian to her core. She felt that this friendship was truly one worth keeping.</p><p>The truth was when her stepfather got into that accident, the Qin Family had offered to pay a hefty sum in compensation, but Huo Mian's family turned it down.</p><p>Instead, they insisted that the driver at fault be given the death penalty in retribution. In the end, however, the driver was only charged with drunk driving and sentenced to five years in jail.</p><p>They, on the other hand, didn't receive a single dime in the settlement. Now, seven years later, the responsible party had long been released from prison.</p><p>However, her Uncle Jing now slumbered beneath North Hill Public Cemetery, never to open his eyes again.</p><p>That was why no matter how her mother treated her or hated her, she genuinely accepted it all. During these seven years, she hadn't been able to forgive herself either.</p><p>\"Mom, I'm working the night shift today, and I will be leaving in a minute. Please rest well. I'll arrange for your lunch and dinner to be delivered. Zhixin is off school tomorrow, so he'll come to visit you.\"</p><p>\"Get lost.\" Yang Meirong still treated her with the same disdainful attitude.</p><p>From there, Huo Mian took the bus to the First Hospital.</p><p>She checked her watch when she arrived. There were still forty minutes until the start of her shift. Changing into her nurse's uniform, she made her way to the ophthalmology building.</p><p>She still wanted to give Ning Zhiyuan one more try. After all, they had been together for three years. Even if there was no love between them, there was still a faint attachment.</p><p>When Huo Mian arrived, the door was only half closed. Just as she was about to knock, she heard a flirting voice inside.</p><p>\"Doctor Ning, you're the worst.

I'll fix your hair for you later. Come here and give me a kiss first.\" </p><p>Huo Mian could tell that the voices belonged to He Man and Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>No wonder he had moved out in such a hurry. So that was how things were... </p><p>The corner of her lips twitched. With a chuckle, she lowered the hand she'd raised to knock and turned around to leave.</p><p>She was just in time to see another doctor from the Ophthalmology Department approaching the door. \"Huh, Huo Mian, why don't you go inside if you're already here?\" </p><p>\"It's alright. I have other things to do.\" </p><p>By this time, the two inside had clearly heard the conversation. He Man immediately leaped up from Ning Zhiyuan's lap, smoothing out her collar and hair. </p><p>That was when the ophthalmologist, Doctor Zhu, just walked in. Glancing at He Man, he told Ning Zhiyuan, \"I just saw your fiancé.\" </p><p>\"Oh really?\" Ning Zhiyuan's response was rather indifferent. </p><p>\"You guys… are you guys alright? Weren't you two getting married?\" </p><p>\"Not anymore.\" </p><p>\"You can't be serious …\" Doctor Zhu was surprised. </p><p>\"Humph, I see no reason to keep a woman like that around.\" With that, Ning Zhiyuan stood up and, buttoning up his white lab coat, left the room. </p><p>He Man trailed cautiously behind him. </p><p>Seeing this, Doctor Zhu shook his head, dejected. Young people these days really treated relationships too lightly. What had the world come to? </p><p>\"Doctor Ning, did you really… break up with Huo Mian?\" </p><p>\"What do you think?\" </p><p>\"That's fantastic! Now, people won't say that I'm the 'other woman' anymore. When are you going to tell everyone at the hospital that we are together?\" He Man whined, half-flirting. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan glanced at her carelessly, \"What's the rush? Isn't it more fun to sneak around?\" </p><p>\"Oh, you're the worst! Really…\" He Man reached out and pinched Ning Zhiyuan's hand lightly as she squealed. </p><p>As one of the assistant nurses in the Ophthalmology Department, she had admired Ning Zhiyuan for a long time, and for a good reason: Ning Zhiyuan was both handsome and smart. </p><p>In addition, his surgery performances had been good. So, although he was still an intern, he would soon become an attending physician. By then, his status within the department would be even higher. </p><p>Before this, she'd always been looking for opportunities to approach him. However, back then, Ning Zhiyuan only had eyes for Huo Mian. </p><p>It made her nearly mad with envy, watching Ning Zhiyuan go off to buy midnight snacks for Huo Mian. So long as it was something Huo Mian liked to eat, Ning Zhiyuan would go and buy it even if he had to sacrifice sleep after finishing a night shift. He was the perfect boyfriend. </p><p>Now that she had finally gotten a chance, she wouldn't let it slip away for the world. </p><p>Inside the nurse's dressing room- </p><p>Huo Mian sat resting, half-inclined and with a cup of water in her hand. Her mind was elsewhere. </p><p>When He Man walked in and saw Huo Mian sitting there alone, she felt a surge of satisfaction well up in her chest. </p><p>\"Sister Huo Mian.\" </p><p>\"What is it?\" Huo Mian turned her head towards her, expressionless. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, Doctor Ning and I…\" </p><p>\"I know everything. What, did you want me to congratulate you?\" Huo Mian sneered. </p><p>He Man stiffened. She felt like the Huo Mian before her now was somehow different from the gentle girl she usually was. </p><p>\"That's not what I meant. I just wanted to say that I did nothing wrong. Even if it weren't for me, Doctor Ning wouldn't have stayed with you. He told me himself; it really bothers him that his future wife wasn't a virgin.\" </p><p>\"Really? From the way you're talking, you've slept with him already, right? Otherwise, you wouldn't have come preaching to me.\" Turning away from He Man, Huo Mian raised her cup to her lips and took a sip. </p><p>Unwilling to back down, He Man goaded at her, \"Of course, I'm clean. Doctor Ning said that he was going to marry me.\" </p><p>\"So what?\" Huo Mian stood up, demanding in an icy tone. </p><p>\"So nothing. What I wanted to say is this - I won this battle, didn't I? Please stop bothering Doctor Ning. After all, you're not together anymore. A rational woman shouldn't cling to a man shamelessly.\" He Man's words were a warning. </p><p>After hearing this, Huo Mian gave her the sweetest of smiles. </p><p>It made the hairs on the back of He Man's neck stand up. </p><p>\"Why are you smiling?\" </p><p>\"My mother once told me that I should give away the toys I didn't like to children that are less fortunate than me because they are pitiful.\" </p><p>\"You…\" He Man was unable to form a complete sentence. She never thought that this seemingly gentle nurse had such a dark side. </p><p>\"Excuse me, let me through. I have work to do.\" Gesturing with her hand, Huo Mian calmly walked out of the dressing room. </p><p>Truth be told, she really wasn't too upset about Ning Zhiyuan breaking up with her. The only thing was, Ning Zhiyuan had been good to her for the past few years and that was why she wanted to try to patch things up. However, now that it had come to this, she naturally wouldn't try anymore. Shamelessly clinging on? That really wasn't her style. </p><p>Outside a delivery room in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department- </p><p>\"Huo Mian.\" As Huo Mian was about to go inside to help with a delivery, she was stopped by the head nurse. </p><p>\"Head nurse, you called me?\" Huo Mian turned around. </p><p>\"The director wants you in his office,\" the head nurse said in a clear, crisp tone.</p><p>\"The director wants me?\" Huo Mian was caught by surprise. More than that, she was confused. The director was rumored to be a very busy man who wouldn't show up to the hospital more than a couple times a year, and even the head nurse hadn't had a chance to meet him this year. Why would he suddenly ask for her? What was going on?</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":24,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:50.06","Link":"Chapter-24","NameDisplay":"Chapter 24"},{"ID":181120947505741638,"Name":"Chapter 25: Orders","NameUnsign":"Chapter 25: Orders","Description":"<p>Chapter 25: Orders</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>It actually took less than ten minutes to walk from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department to the director's office, but Huo Mian managed to stretch it to fifteen by walking slowly.</p><p>Director Wu Zhongxing was a man of over fifty, with a square face, sharp eyes, and an old-fashioned way of doing things.</p><p>Of course, as a nurse intern who had been working at the First Hospital for less than a year, Huo Mian had yet to have the honor of meeting the director in person.</p><p>She had only seen him in photographs on the hospital's official webpage. From what she had heard, the director was an outstanding orthopedics professor in his youth.</p><p>In addition, he was a visiting professor in Europe many times in the past.</p><p>Without realizing it, she arrived outside the director's office. Standing at the door was a fancy man in a crisp suit and gold-rimmed glasses.</p><p>\"Are you Huo Mian?\" the man spoke first.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"The director's waiting for you inside. Head on in.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded. Then, being slightly anxious, she knocked on the door.</p><p>\"Come in.\" A deep, solemn voice rang out from inside.</p><p>Huo Mian walked inside to see the director. As expected, he looked pretty much the same as in his photos, and the white physician's lab coat was extremely bright.</p><p>Although the director was not yet sixty years old, his hair was already streaked with white, and there were clear wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.</p><p>\"Are you Huo Mian?\" The director began the conversation.</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>\"Come and sit down.\" The director's attitude was surprisingly amicable. This, however, made Huo Mian even more uneasy.</p><p>\"It's alright, I'll just stand.\" Huo Mian was still a little withdrawn.</p><p>\"Don't be afraid. Let's sit down and talk.\" The director gestured, motioning for Huo Mian to have a seat.</p><p>Huo Mian thought that if she were to refuse again, she might appear unreasonable. So, she walked over and sat down gently on the black sofa.</p><p>\"Here's the thing: I called you here today because I have a very important task for you.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded, \"Okay, director. Please tell me. As long as it's within the range of my capabilities, I promise I will do my best.\"</p><p>\"Yesterday, an official from the capital city of Jing came to inspect C City. However, he suddenly suffered acute cerebral hemorrhaging and was brought into our hospital's most exclusive VIP suite last night. Our medical facilities and equipment aren't really top of the line to begin with. However, the official's condition is dire and he's not stable enough to be transferred to another hospital. With his critical condition, the slightest move can result in severe intracranial hemorrhaging. Therefore, the other executives and I held an emergency meeting and decided to perform the craniotomy here, at this hospital. The surgery will take place three hours from now, and the top neurosurgeons will personally perform the procedure.\"</p><p>After the director had finished, Huo Mian nodded her head. She understood the situation now; it was dire indeed.</p><p>Since the official came from Jing City, he or she must hold a highly important position within the government. No wonder the director was taking this matter so seriously.</p><p>\"Director, is there anything I can do to help?\"</p><p>\"I would like you to be the scrub nurse for this surgery.\"</p><p>At this, Huo Mian immediately objected, \"Director, how can you ask that of me? I'm a delivery nurse who works in the OB/GYN Department, and I don't know anything about neurosurgery. You should send someone like the head nurse to assist, not an intern like me. I believe that you must have seen my resume. I'm not a graduate of a famous institution. Rather, I graduated from the advanced nursing program at one of our city's ordinary medical academies.\"</p><p>\"I know that,\" the director replied earnestly.</p><p>\"If you already know, then why are you giving this task to me? That… that's not a sensible decision,\" Huo Mian said calmly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":25,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:50.573","Link":"Chapter-25","NameDisplay":"Chapter 25"},{"ID":18112094751361813,"Name":"Chapter 26: Risk","NameUnsign":"Chapter 26: Risk","Description":"<p>Chapter 26: Risk</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Huo Mian, you don't need to say any more. It's been decided, so just do as you're told. This is a task assigned to you by the hospital. If the official recovers well after the surgery, I will reward everyone involved with the procedure with bonuses and honors.\"</p><p>Against his expectations, Huo Mian shook her head and stood up. \"Director, I don't need awards and honors,\" she said, \"I just don't think I can accomplish this task. I apologize, but I cannot accept this.\"</p><p>\"You are really a stubborn child, aren't you?\" The director's voice carried a hint of dejection.</p><p>\"Director, I'm only telling the truth as I see it. This surgery is far too important. If this were delivering a child or something of that nature, I might have been able to help. But with a neurosurgical procedure, I may just be a hindrance to the team. I suggest you find someone more suited for the task.\"</p><p>With that, Huo Mian stood up and headed towards the door. She wasn't about to catch this hot potato.</p><p>She was really questioning the director's sanity at this point. The First Hospital had hundreds of outstanding nurses, so why did he have to pick her, an intern from the OB/GYN department, to serve as the scrub nurse for such an important operation? It was laughable, really.</p><p>Just as Huo Mian made it to the door and was about to open it, the director's voice sounded again.</p><p>\"Huo Mian. The truth is, I'm not the one who decided that you should be the scrub nurse for this surgery. The attending neurosurgeon handling this case personally asked for you.\"</p><p>\"The attending neurosurgeon asked for me?\" Huo Mian turned around in disbelief.</p><p>\"That's right. The attending neurosurgeon has an odd temper and was even more difficult to invite. It took a lot of effort for us to convince him to perform this surgery, but he had only one request - that you be the scrub nurse. Otherwise, he won't perform the surgery. You should know that there's a life at stake here. The bigwig official is still at our hospital. If anything were to happen to him… it wouldn't just affect you and me. The entire hospital will be crippled from the repercussions.\"</p><p>\"But…\" Huo Mian was dumbstruck. \"I don't know any attending surgeons. Did he get the name wrong? Are there any other nurses with the same name as me at our hospital?\"</p><p>\"No. You're the only one called Huo Mian. I wouldn't get that wrong.\"</p><p>\"But…\" Huo Mian was still somewhat reluctant.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, stop saying 'but', we have no time to waste. The surgery will commence three hours from now, and you need to be in the OR in an hour to begin prepping. You'll also need to meet with the other team members.\"</p><p>\"Director…\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, this is an order. You must accept it.\" Director Wu was getting impatient. His face fell, and his demeanor took on a forceful edge.</p><p>Huo Mian fell silent.</p><p>She wondered if she would seem overly inconsiderate if she were to resign right now. However, if the surgery were to fail and the official kicked the bucket, wouldn't she be just as doomed?</p><p>Huo Mian felt like crying. She should have known that being summoned by the director himself all of a sudden couldn't have possibly been good news.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Huo Mian finally nodded.</p><p>\"That's great. Then you should go prepare now. Be at the Neurosurgery Department's VIP OR on the top floor in an hour.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded again.</p><p>Walking out of the director's office, Huo Mian's mind was a mess of emotions.</p><p>When she returned to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, she saw the head nurse waiting there for her with several other nurses. It was quite the welcoming committee.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, the director already called me and roughly explained the situation. Hurry, go change, and then perform a full-body sterilization. When you're done, I'll ask someone to escort you up to the operation room on the top floor.\"</p><p>\"Uh… Head Nurse, it's alright. I can go by myself.\" Huo Mian was unaccustomed to special treatment.</p><p>\"No, you can't. This is an extremely important task and you must do a good job.\"</p><p>\"Miss Huo, you're so lucky! I heard that the attending neurosurgeon personally asked for you.\"</p><p>\"I don't know what's going on as well.\"</p><p>\"The attending surgeon isn't a friend of yours, is he? How come nothing as good as this ever happens to the rest of us?\" several of the younger nurses whined incessantly.</p><p>\"Uh… I don't know any attendings,\" Huo Mian replied in the negative.</p><p>\"Enough, stop talking, all of you. Hurry up and get ready, Huo Mian. I have to remind you that, while it is a good thing that the director trusts you with this task, if you mess this up, the consequence wouldn't be as simple as just getting fired. You know how important this patient is, right?\" The head nurse's words were sharp and to the point.</p><p>Huo Mian gave a little nod and replied, \"I know. If it fails, my life might be over too.\"</p><p>As she finished her sentence, the younger nurses all went pale.</p><p>\"Now, do you still think Huo Mian is lucky?\" the head nurse asked with a darkened expression. \"Any of you still want to take her place?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":26,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:51.037","Link":"Chapter-26","NameDisplay":"Chapter 26"},{"ID":181120947514998400,"Name":"Chapter 27: The Doctor","NameUnsign":"Chapter 27: The Doctor","Description":"<p>Chapter 27: The Doctor</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>After Huo Mian finished changing, she refused the offer from another nurse in her department to accompany her and walked up to the VIP area on the top floor alone. </p><p>On her way there, the only thing she could think of was that, if the procedure were to fail, she might not even get the chance to see her family again. </p><p>At that thought, she pulled out her cell phone and called her mother. It rang for a while, but no one answered. Clearly, her mother didn't want to talk to her. </p><p>She sighed and then called her little brother, Jing Zhixin. </p><p>\"Sis!\" Jing Zhixin's youthful voice sounded from the other end. </p><p>\"Zhixin, are you in class?\" </p><p>\"Not anymore. I didn't have many classes today so I'm at the library, doing a bit of research. Is everything okay?\" </p><p>\"Oh, it is. I'm a bit busy today, so I might not be able to go to Fourth People's Hospital. If you have the time, don't forget to go check on mom.\" </p><p>\"I know. I'll go when I'm done here, and I'll buy some dinner for mom.\" </p><p>\"Alright.\" Huo Mian's mind was weighed down by other things. </p><p>\"Sis, I'll talk to you later.\" </p><p>\"Zhixin, if I become too busy, I might not be able to take care of you two. You have to take care of our mom for me.\"</p><p>\"Got it, Sis.\" With that, Jing Zhixin hung up. </p><p>Lifting up her phone again, Huo Mian flipped through her contact list until she reached Ning Zhiyuan's name. She didn't really see a need to make that call. </p><p>Instead, she dialed Zhu Lingling's number. However, the call didn't go through, so she was probably on a flight. </p><p>Putting away her phone, Huo Mian took a deep breath and, clearing her mind, she opened the door of the lounge adjacent to the operating room. </p><p>A man, who seemed to be in his thirties, spoke to her first, \"You're Huo Mian, right?\" </p><p>\"I am.\" </p><p>\"I'm the scrub nurse of the Neurosurgery Department, Song Heng. You can just call me Song.\" </p><p>\"Hello,\" Huo Mian greeted him. </p><p>\"These are the names and profiles of those involved with the surgery today. Have a look.\" </p><p>Song Heng handed Huo Mian a file, and she slowly flipped it open.</p><p>Assistant Surgeon: MD Wang Qi, male, 47, renowned neurosurgical specialist, graduated from Jing Medical University</p><p>Assistant Surgeon: MD Huang Xiaoning, female, 43, renowned neurosurgical specialist, graduated from the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland.</p><p>Anesthesiologist: MD Fang Xu, 42, expert anesthesiologist, graduated from Osaka Medical University.</p><p>Scrub Nurse: NP Song Heng, 35, neurosurgery scrub nurse, graduated from the School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore. </p><p>Scrub Nurse: Huo Mian, 24, intern obstetrics scrub nurse, graduated from the Advanced Nursing Program at C City Medical Academy. </p><p>Compared to the profiles before her, Huo Mian felt like an ant before giants. </p><p>If there were so many experts lying about, why did they have to send an OB/GYN intern nurse like her in here to risk her life? </p><p>That's right, the director said that she was personally picked by the lead surgeon. Where was his or her profile? </p><p>She raised her head. \"Umm…\" she asked, \"why isn't the profile of the lead surgeon here?\" </p><p>\"Oh, it's not on file. The lead surgeon doesn't like attention, and he refused to reveal too much of his personal information. All I heard was that he's a very young man with a postdoctoral degree from Harvard Medical School.\" </p><p>\"He has a postdoctoral degree from Harvard Medical School?\" Huo Mian was left completely in shock. </p><p>Someone as impressive as him existed in a little third-tier city like theirs? How come she had never heard of this person before?</p><p>\"Okay, have some confidence, we'll definitely succeed!\" Song Heng smiled. </p><p>\"I really hope so,\" Huo Mian said and returned a smile. </p><p>Just then, the door of the lounge was pushed open and four doctors in white lab coats entered the room. </p><p>When Huo Mian saw the last person to walk in, she felt like her brain was about to short-circuit.</p><p>That's… Qin Chu… right?</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":27,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:51.5","Link":"Chapter-27","NameDisplay":"Chapter 27"},{"ID":181120947519802162,"Name":"Chapter 28: Betting on One's Life","NameUnsign":"Chapter 28: Betting on One's Life","Description":"<p>Chapter 28: Betting on One's Life</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Hello everyone, I'm the lead surgeon for this operation. Next, I'm going to hold a surgical meeting with all of you here. Please listen very carefully and understand your individual responsibilities. I don't want to see any mistakes during the surgery. In other words, this procedure is a wager, and all of our lives are on the line. We can only succeed because no failures will be tolerated. Understand?\" </p><p>\"Understood.\" The others all treated him with great respect. Only Huo Mian stood dumbfounded, unable to respond in time. </p><p>Qin Chu, on the other hand, hadn't even looked directly at Huo Mian since he entered the room. Instead, he picked up a thick stack of paperwork and began going over the patient's medical history.</p><p>\"Time is of the essence, so I'll make it short. The patient suffers from secondary cerebral hemorrhaging, specifically caused by bleeding of the brain tissue surrounding the ventricular system into the cerebrum. There is a hemorrhage in the putamen entering the lateral ventricle between the front of the caudate nucleus and the capsula interna, internal bleeding in the thalamus entering the third ventricle, and from the pons entering the fourth ventricle. As such, we will utilize different treatment techniques accordingly. During the operation, in order to relieve the patient's intracranial pressure, I will first create a lateral ventricular puncture through the front to allow the cerebral-spinal fluid to exit. Then, I will create burr holes in the cranium where the hematoma is present and, combined with the use of synthetic enzymes, liquefy the hematoma and expel the fluid. During the procedure, a number of unexpected conditions may come up. Examples of these include a sudden increase in the patient's blood pressure or severe intracranial hemorrhaging caused by a burst blood vessel. Therefore, we must make every possible preparation ahead of time in order to ensure our success.\" After Qin Chu finished, he scanned the room.</p><p>\"Is that understood?\" he asked in a cold tone. </p><p>\"Yes.\" The group's answer was concise. </p><p>\"Let's go.\" With that, Qin Chu led the way into the operating room next door. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, pay attention. Did you hear what Doctor Qin just said?\" </p><p>\"I did.\" With Song's warning, Huo Mian tried her best to keep herself calm. </p><p>After everyone entered the operating room, Qin Chu glanced behind him at the anesthesiologist.</p><p>\"Let's begin. Apply general anesthesia.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>\"Huo Mian, insert an urethral catheter for the patient, I will insert the patient's IV and apply an oxygen mask.\" Song said quietly. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded. Picking up the catheter, she just made it to the side of the operating table when a voice stopped her. </p><p>\"Huo Mian,\" Qin Chu suddenly called her name. </p><p>\"Here,\" she reflexively answered. </p><p>\"Insert the patient's IV and apply the oxygen mask,\" he ordered. </p><p>\"Me?\" Huo Mian was about to say that Song was doing those things already. </p><p>However, she heard Qin Chu proceed to instruct Song, \"Go insert the catheter for the patient.\" </p><p>\"Yes, Doctor Qin.\" Not daring to disobey orders, Song immediately swapped tasks with Huo Mian and went to the lower half of the patient's body. </p><p>As Huo Mian looked at the sixty-something old man lying on the operating table, a thought suddenly occurred to her. </p><p>Qin Chu intentionally swapped their tasks, didn't he? Had it been to prevent her from inserting this patient's urethral catheter? </p><p>God, wasn't that going too far? Was it really necessary? </p><p>Huo Mian didn't dare to linger on the matter anymore. She only proceeded as Qin Chu had ordered, no matter how many questions she might have had in her mind. </p><p>After Qin Chu had returned to the country, rumors said he was now the President of GK. </p><p>However, during his years abroad, why did he get a postdoctoral degree at Harvard Medical School? Instead of becoming a doctor after graduation, he went on to become the president of a business empire. That's bizarre. Could it be that it was because of what happened back in the days…? </p><p>\"Huo Mian, keep an eye on the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. I'm opening his cranium now, keep me updated on his status.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>Tension was high in the air throughout the entire course of the surgery. Because they all knew how important this procedure was, they didn't dare to let their attention slip. </p><p>The surgery took a full eight hours. By the end, Huo Mian was weak with exhaustion. </p><p>She didn't remember anything, only that Qin Chu kept on using technical terms and ordering her, \"Curved forceps, periosteal detacher, hemostat, three-prong rake retractor, dura forceps, nerve stripper, nerve retractor…\" </p><p>She felt like her head was about to explode. </p><p>She was assigned to the OB/GYN Department ever since she began working at this hospital six months ago. Most of the surgeries she had seen were C-sections. </p><p>Compared to neurosurgery, C-sections seemed as simple as a chicken laying eggs. </p><p>So this was what a high-level surgery really looked like... </p><p>Finally, the surgery was complete. As the surgical light snapped off, Huo Mian stole a glance at Qin Chu and saw that there was actually sweat beading on his forehead. </p><p>\"The surgery was a success. Well done, Doctor Qin.\" The two assistant surgeons were pleased with the results. </p><p>Qin Chu didn't reply, and only nodded his head. He stripped off his gloves and walked out of the operating room. </p><p>Song and several other nurses immediately transferred the patient to the ICU for observation, and the other surgeons were finally able to rest. </p><p>As Qin Chu left, Huo Mian followed right behind him... </p><p>She walked very slowly. In reality, she was avoiding Qin Chu, not wanting any direct contact with him. </p><p>Just then, Qin Chu's cell phone rang, and he stopped in his tracks to answer. Seizing the opportunity, Huo Mian immediately picked up her pace and shot ahead a dozen meters, stopping in front of a water dispenser. She grabbed a paper cup and filled it with water. </p><p>After gulping down several cups of water, she poured a cup of hot water, planning on taking it with her. Just as she was about to turn and leave, she saw Qin Chu walking towards her.</p><p>The two stood, face to face.

If the boiling water landed on them, it would probably scald her feet. </p><p>\"Ah…\" Not having time to react, she could only watch as the cup fell. </p><p>Just then, a pair of broad hands reached out and caught the cup squarely between them. </p><p>However, due to the downward momentum, a fair amount of hot water still spilled out. Large red splotches immediately flared up on the back of Qin Chu's left hand, extending down to the base of his thumb. </p><p>\"Here's your cup.\" Qin Chu straightened up, his expression unchanging, as he handed the cup over to her. </p><p>\"How's your hand?\" Huo Mian asked nervously. </p><p>\"It's fine.\" </p><p>\"What do you mean it's fine? It's all red. Quick, come here and run it under cold water.\" Huo Mian snatched the cup from Qin Chu's hand and tossed it into the trash without another glance. </p><p>Then, tugging him by his sleeve, she pulled him up to the water dispenser. Holding his scalded left hand under the nozzle, she pressed down on the cold water button. </p><p>Qin Chu didn't make a sound as he let Huo Mian do all of this. </p><p>If he hadn't just misread the situation, when his hand was scalded, was that… nervousness… in Huo Mian's eyes? </p><p>Thinking of this, the corner of Qin Chu's lips lifted slightly in triumph. </p><p>\"Does it still hurt?\" Huo Mian asked, raising her head. </p><p>Qin Chu shook his head no. </p><p>Only then had Huo Mian realized that she was still holding his hand. In order to avoid making the situation even more awkward, she immediately let him go. </p><p>\"Um… you should go to the pharmacy later and pick up a tube of burn cream,\" Huo Mian reminded him. </p><p>\"It's fine.\" His voice was low and husky, with a magnetic quality. </p><p>\"Since you're fine, I'll be leaving now.\" In truth, Huo Mian was terrified of facing Qin Chu alone. </p><p>It was because she was afraid that the strange feeling bubbling up in her chest would grow even more audaciously. </p><p>She was even more afraid that Qin Chu would be able to see through to what she'd really been thinking. </p><p>\"Mian,\" he spoke again, gently. </p><p>She stopped in her tracks but didn't turn around. She stood there in silence, awaiting his next words. </p><p>\"Thank you for your hard work today.\" </p><p>\"You too, Doctor Qin.\" With that, Huo Mian sped up her pace and quickly left the room, not daring to stay a second longer. </p><p>Qin Chu was left speechless by Huo Mian's words. Doctor Qin? He coughed inwardly. That was a low blow. If he didn't know any better, he would have thought that she was addressing an old man. </p><p>However, he was indeed worthy of the \"Doctor\" title. </p><p>Thanks to this peculiar surgical procedure, he seemed to have gotten just a little closer to Huo Mian. </p><p>Qin Chu was very pleased. Slipping his hands into his pockets, he left wearing his signature better-than-thou expression. On him, the white lab coat that the doctors wore looked surprisingly tasteful. The point was that good-looking people looked good, no matter what they wore. </p><p>Behind him, several young nurses were already fangirling... </p><p>\"Woah, which department is that doctor from? He's so young and hot!\" one of the nurses lauded. </p><p>\"I thought that, too. His poise is amazing. Even the way he walks is hot as hell and so domineering. But I love it!\" another young nurse said, not even bothering to disguise her adoration. </p><p>\"Oh no, I feel my heart thumping really hard. Quick, go ask around. Which department is this new doctor in? I have to act first.\" </p><p>The young nurses chattered excitedly amongst themselves. </p><p>However, they didn't know just how special this person really was.

At the sight of Huo Mian, the head nurse quickly finished her conversation and hung up the phone. She nodded at Huo Mian and said, \"Take a seat.\"</p><p>\"Yes, ma'am.\"</p><p>Xu Yan, the head nurse, was famous in the OB/GYN Department for being a stone-cold workaholic. She had made many interns cry.</p><p>Weaker-hearted interns had either quit or transferred to another department.</p><p>Huo Mian had interned under Xu Yan for 6 months now. Although the head nurse was intimidating, she was very professional and knowledgeable. Huo Mian preferred these qualities about Xu Yan, and as far as she was concerned, Xu Yan was much better than those greedy co-workers who only cared about money.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, the hospital director's assistant just called and asked me to pass along the message to you. The surgery for the government official was very successful, and he should wake up in 12 hours.\"</p><p>\"Oh really? That's fantastic!\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"The director wants to reward the staff involved in this surgery after the official wakes up. Three from our hospital participated in it - the anesthesiologist, you, and another male nurse. The director would like to know what rewards you would like.\"</p><p>\"The patient isn't conscious yet, isn't it a little too early to speak of rewards?\" Huo Mian asked, slightly hesitant.</p><p>\"The director is sure that the official will wake up. Just tell me what you would like, and I will pass it along to the higher-ups,\" Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p>Huo Mian thought for a second and asked, \"Ma'am, could I really make a request?\"</p><p>\"Of course, as long as it's not too over the top.\"</p><p>\"I was hoping to get a pay bonus.\" Huo Mian made sure she enunciated every word.</p><p>\"A pay bonus?\" The head nurse looked surprised. \"I thought you would ask for a permanent position.\"</p><p>The process of obtaining a permanent position required at least three years. On top of that, interns must go through a rigorous process of testing and grading. It was a long and complicated process.</p><p>\"A full-time position? Oh, I haven't thought of that. After all, I've only been here for 6 months, so I don't expect to become a full-timer any time soon. A bonus of 1,000 yuan might be more useful right now.\"</p><p>She truly needed the money. Not only did she max out her credit card, she also owed Lingling 1,000 yuan.</p><p>So even if the hospital could only give her 1,000 yuan, that would still help out the situation. At the very least, her younger brother would have enough money to live for the next month.</p><p>\"Alright, I will pass on your message. But, the decision will ultimately be made by the director.\"</p><p>\"Alright, ma'am, if there is nothing else, I'll get back to work,\" said Huo Mian as she got up to leave.</p><p>\"Oh, Huo Mian.\"</p><p>\"Yes, ma'am?\" Huo Mian turned around.</p><p>\"I've heard that the lead surgeon for this operation is an incredible neurosurgeon, and all of his assisting surgeons are domestically-renowned doctors. He...is he very young?\" asked the head nurse, slightly embarrassed.</p><p>The head nurse didn't mean to pry; she was just curious. She heard that the surgeon was from Harvard, but hadn't had the chance to meet him in person yet. She could only ask Huo Mian to quench her interest.</p><p>After three seconds of silence, Huo Mian bit down on her lips and replied, \"Yes, he's very young.\"</p><p>For reasons unclear to her, Huo Mian felt proud speaking about Qin Chu.</p><p>Despite the director's relentless efforts in inviting him to dinner, Qin Chu rejected the offer after the surgery.</p><p>Eating dinner with a dry and uninteresting old man? It was too boring to even think about.</p><p>Plus, it wasn't the director who convinced him to perform the operation. If it had only been him, Qin Chu probably wouldn't have accepted it in the first place.</p><p>As he walked out of the hospital, Qin Chu took out his phone and called his driver to pick him up. Suddenly, he saw a black Jaguar slowing down and stopping in front of him.</p><p>The window rolled down, and the young man sitting inside took off his sunglasses. Surprised, he exclaimed, \"Qin Chu?!\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":30,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:53.023","Link":"Chapter-30","NameDisplay":"Chapter 30"},{"ID":181120947535586034,"Name":"Chapter 31: The Good-for-nothing Friend","NameUnsign":"Chapter 31: The Good-for-nothing Friend","Description":"<p>Chapter 31: The Good-for-nothing Friend</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"It's been a long time.\" After recognizing the man inside, Qin Chu calmly waved.</p><p>\"Oh shit, it's really you! You're back and you didn't even tell me?! Get in! We'll find a place to catch up.\"</p><p>Unable to say no, Qin Chu got into the black Jaguar.</p><p>The owner of the Jaguar was none other than Qin Chu's childhood best friend, Gao Ran.</p><p>Just as Qin Chu stepped into the car, his phone began to ring...</p><p>\"You don't need to pick me up, I have things to do. I'll return a little bit later. Put the documents in my office and cancel my appointments this afternoon. That's all.\" Qin Chu hung up immediately.</p><p>\"You went back to work at GK?\" Gao Ran asked with a laugh.</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"How long has it been?\"</p><p>\"More than a week.\"</p><p>Gao Ran tapped himself on the head. \"Sh*t, if it weren't for my stupid boss sending me away to study out of town, I would've heard the news of your return a long time ago. But what the hell man? You didn't even call me?\"</p><p>\"I tried to call, but it didn't go through.\"</p><p>\"Oh, right. We're not allowed to use cell phones during class,\" Gao Ran said, clearly happy to reunite with Qin Chu.</p><p>- Half an hour later -</p><p>The two men sat down in an elegant tea house. The room had a charming sense of antiquity.</p><p>Gao Ran asked sincerely, \"How long has it been? Seven or eight years?\"</p><p>\"Seven years exactly.\"</p><p>\"Time sure flies. You were just a stupid kid when you left, and now you're the President of GK! Haha.\"</p><p>\"You're one to talk. You were a punk on the street seven years ago, and now you're the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. What a huge change,\" Qin Chu said, picking up the teacup.</p><p>\"Ugh! My dad said that my grandpa was a cop and he was a cop, so now it's my turn to be one too. He doesn't care whether I get married or have kids, but he would disown me if I didn't become a cop.\"</p><p>\"A family of policemen, not bad,\" Qin Chu said lightly.</p><p>\"Bullsh*t! I never wanted to be a cop. It pays so little, and there's so much to handle. If you don't get it done, you'll get scolded. Do you think it was easy for me to get to this director position?! I got shot in the stomach in an anti-terrorist operation two years ago. I almost died!\" Gao Ran lifted his shirt to show Qin Chu his scars.</p><p>\"Great. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\"</p><p>\"Get out of here. Stop bullsh*tting me. I don't mind trading places with you. You can be a police director, and I'll be the president of a business empire!\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" Qin Chu replied in a serious tone.</p><p>\"Yeah right, I don't have any talent in business. I'll just remain as a happy-go-lucky cop.\" As he finished his sentence, Gao Ran picked up his teacup and took a small sip.</p><p>\"Look at you, leaving without any notice, for seven years no less! What's wrong with you? Do you know how much I missed you? I called your dad to get your address, but he wasn't willing to give it to me,\" Gao Ran whined.</p><p>\"Yeah, that was an agreement I had with my father. I told him I wouldn't return nor contact anyone back home before the seven-year period was up.\"</p><p>\"What kind of bullsh*t deal is that?! I really don't understand you.\"</p><p>\"No, I did it all for one person,\" Qin Chu said, enunciating each word.</p><p>Gao Ran suddenly remembered what happened seven years ago. He asked hesitantly, \"Does this deal have anything to do with Huo Mian?\"</p><p>Qin Chu remained silent...but his answer was obvious.</p><p>\"I thought so. Qin Chu, why are you still hung up on a woman like her? Don't you remember how she treated you seven years ago? Forget her and find a Caucasian girlfriend. Do you know who you are? You are the heir to GK for god's sake! You can have anything and anyone you want, so why torture yourself over a woman?\"</p><p>\"Seven years ago...it wasn't her fault. I couldn't protect her.\"</p><p>\"So what are you doing now? Did you come back for her?\" Gao Ran looked bewildered.</p><p>Qin Chu avoided the question and looked at his watch instead.</p><p>\"I have somewhere to be, I'll catch up with you another day.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, alright. Remember to keep in touch.\" Gao Ran got up to walk him out.</p><p>When he arrived at GK, Qin Chu went upstairs and headed directly to his office. He was surprised to see a woman sitting on the sofa.</p><p>At the sight of Qin Chu, she quickly got up, flashing him a beautiful smile.</p><p>\"President Qin, you've returned.\"</p><p>Qin Chu frowned...</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":31,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:53.56","Link":"Chapter-31","NameDisplay":"Chapter 31"},{"ID":18112094754306208,"Name":"Chapter 32: Sexual Preference","NameUnsign":"Chapter 32: Sexual Preference","Description":"<p>Chapter 32: Sexual Preference</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>At the sight of the president's less-than-impressed gaze, Jiang Linyue immediately began to introduce herself cautiously.</p><p>\"President Qin, I am the director of GK's luxury designs. My name is Jiang Linyue.\"</p><p>\"Why are you here?\" Qin Chu's voice was cold.</p><p>\"Oh, I'm here to present the newest luxury design samples of this season. This time, our department launched several new models —\"</p><p>\"Put the material down, you can leave,\" Qin Chu interrupted Jiang Linyue ruthlessly before she could finish her sentence.</p><p>\"President Qin, I think it would be better if I went over some of the details with you.\" To say that Jiang Linyue was dumbfounded would be an understatement. She felt like her attitude was extremely proper: she didn't ogle like other women, nor was she pretentious. Why was the president so unimpressed?</p><p>\"You don't have to discuss the details with me. Discussing it with the Vice President will suffice.\"</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Chu's words, a sense of disappointment washed over Jiang Linyue. She had prepared a full speech for the young president but was cut off before she even began.</p><p>\"You can leave now,\" Qin Chu ordered.</p><p>\"Yes, President Qin.\"</p><p>Jiang Linyue took the papers and left, very unwillingly.</p><p>Before leaving, she looked back at Qin Chu, catching a glimpse of him taking off his jacket and leaning on his desk. The sight was enough to make any girl fall in love. Back then, she overcame all obstacles to be employed in GK for the sole purpose of being there when Qin Chu rises to the top. The thought of seeing him every day gave her enough happiness.</p><p>After Jiang Linyue left, Qin Chu dialed an internal number.</p><p>\"President Qin, how can I help you?\" Assistant Yang walked into the office respectfully.</p><p>\"I need someone to clean my office at once. Also, next time, do not let anyone into my office. From now on, take all of my visitors to the small conference room.\"</p><p>\"Yes, President Qin.\"</p><p>Qin Chu despised the smell of perfume, and this was a fact only known to those closest to him.</p><p>It wasn't because he was allergic. No, it was because the smell of artificially synthesized fragrances irritates him.</p><p>Jiang Linyue was in his office for too long, and the smell of her Chanel perfume had permeated the air.</p><p>Qin Chu really disliked the smell. In comparison, he much preferred the scent of hospital formaldehyde.</p><p>Or maybe, he only liked the unique scent belonging to that specific person...</p><p>- GK's Department of Design -</p><p>Jiang Linyue returned, looking dejected.</p><p>\"Director Jiang, did you see our big boss? Is he handsome?\"</p><p>\"How do you guys have time to gossip? Don't you have work to do?\" Jiang Linyue asked sourly.</p><p>\"Yes, Director Jiang.\" The assistant secretary hurriedly closed the door and left.</p><p>Sitting in her office chair, Jiang Linyue let out a disappointed sigh...</p><p>Having studied abroad in Paris for three years, she received many design awards.</p><p>Various domestic and internationally-renowned corporations had offered her positions, but she adamantly chose to return to her home country. She was determined to go to C City and work her way into GK, all because she liked Qin Chu.</p><p>She had been at GK for almost two years, waiting for the young president's return.</p><p>Jiang Linyue was both beautiful and talented, not to mention that she had a great taste in clothing. How could the president reject her?</p><p>\"Unless... the president is gay?\" Jiang Linyue mumbled to herself.</p><p>Magazine articles often wrote about how gorgeous men were most likely gay, especially ones without a girlfriend.</p><p>President Qin's face was already more than gorgeous; it was without a single bad angle, and Jiang Linyue had asked many others about the girlfriend thing.</p><p>Everyone responded that the president was single, giving her the confidence to get closer to him. She didn't expect herself to be rejected like that on the first try.</p><p>At noon, just as Qin Chu was about to go to lunch, he received a notification on his phone.</p><p>He opened up WeChat and saw that someone had posted a message in the class's group chat, \"Does anyone know when Goddess Huo is getting married?\"</p><p>He signed up on WeChat a couple of days earlier and didn't add many contacts yet. He was only in the group because Ms. Yao had added him since the last reunion, and he didn't think that he would be able to hear news about Huo Mian in this group.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":32,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:54.033","Link":"Chapter-32","NameDisplay":"Chapter 32"},{"ID":181120947545366699,"Name":"Chapter 33: Calling Off the Wedding","NameUnsign":"Chapter 33: Calling Off the Wedding","Description":"<p>Chapter 33: Calling Off the Wedding</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Within a few seconds, someone replied in the WeChat group.</p><p>\"It's been called off, they broke up,\" Zhu Lingling replied.</p><p>As soon as she sent the message, a few more classmates curiously asked, \"What happened?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, didn't she say that they already bought an apartment together? Why would they call off the wedding?\"</p><p>\"They're not going to get married if they're not right for each other, stop asking so many questions. She saved you your wedding gift money. Oh yeah, keep an eye out for Mian and introduce her to some fine single men,\" Zhu Lingling jokingly replied.</p><p>At that moment, Wei Dong came online and asked, \"Is this for real? Don't joke around.\"</p><p>\"Of course it's real, why would I joke about something so important?\" Zhu Lingling rolled her eyes.</p><p>\"Great, the goddess is single, now is my chance.\" No one knew if Weidong was joking or being serious.</p><p>Then, the girl named Siying Liu replied sourly, \"Yeah, the goddess is single now. If you want to go after her, better hurry and not miss your chance, rich boy.\"</p><p>Qin Chu looked at the chat silently without replying...</p><p>He had no interest in anyone in the group other than Huo Mian.</p><p>All of this reminded him that he had to thank Ms. Yao for their last reunion. If he didn't go all the way to New Zealand and fly Ms. Yao back to C City, Huo Mian might not have attended the reunion. He knew her too well.</p><p>As everybody discussed and gossiped, Huo Mian suddenly came online.</p><p>\"Sorry, I might not be able to treat you guys to a reception. Something did happen with the wedding.\"</p><p>\"Goddess, it's fine. It's that guy who had missed out. Being single is great, ha.\"</p><p>\"Goddess Huo, why not give me a chance?\" Wei Dong said, unclear whether he was joking or not.</p><p>\"Mian, aren't you supposed to be working today? You must be pretty free, considering you're on WeChat,\" asked Zhu Lingling.</p><p>\"Mhm, I just assisted with a surgery, and the head nurse gave me the day off.\"</p><p>\"Ha, that's not bad for the old hag. Let's go eat tonight then, I'm free.\"</p><p>\"Bring me along, I'll pay and you guys can choose the location,\" Wei Dong interjected.</p><p>\"Maybe another day. Lingling, I have to go see my mother at the hospital today.\"</p><p>\"Auntie is in the hospital? What happened?\" Zhu Lingling privately messaged Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Nothing, it's just hypertension. It's not a big problem, don't worry about it,\" Huo Mian replied.</p><p>Then, she got changed, bought food, and took the bus to Fourth Hospital.</p><p>The classmates were still questioning around in the group chat, but she was too lazy to reply. As they were classmates she rarely talked to, she didn't need to pretend that they were close.</p><p>Just then, a WeChat notification suddenly popped out...</p><p>It was a fund transfer of 888 yuan from Wei Dong.</p><p>Attached to it was a message, \"I heard that your mother is hospitalized, this is just a little something from me.\"</p><p>Only then did Huo Mian realized that she had mentioned her mother's hospitalization in the WeChat group. She immediately declined the fund transfer.</p><p>\"Thanks, it's the thought that counts. You really don't have to.\"</p><p>She had very little contact with Wei Dong over the past few years, so how could she accept his money?</p><p>\"Goddess Huo, are you really single now?\"</p><p>\"Mhm, we broke up,\" Huo Mian answered honestly.</p><p>\"Then, can you give me a chance?\" </p><p>\"Don't joke around, old friend.\" Huo Mian felt awkward.</p><p>\"I'm not joking. For real, Huo Mian, I've liked you for a long time. I've had a crush on you since high school. If you don't believe me, just ask my deskmate, Big Mouth Li, because he knows. Back then, you were with Qin Chu so I had no chance to go after you. Then, after graduation, you got a boyfriend, and I didn't want to disturb you.\"</p><p>\"But, I heard from Lingling that you already have a girlfriend,\" Huo Mian asked back.</p><p>\"I have no feelings for her. She's only with me for my family's money so when we break up, I'll just compensate her.\"</p><p>\"Then, how can you be sure that I won't just date you for your money?\" Huo Mian asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":33,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:54.537","Link":"Chapter-33","NameDisplay":"Chapter 33"},{"ID":181120947551419905,"Name":"Chapter 34: Knowing One's Place","NameUnsign":"Chapter 34: Knowing One's Place","Description":"<p>Chapter 34: Knowing One's Place</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You're not that type of person, because of what you did to Qin Chu at graduation.

When we were in school, he always secretly put snacks in your desk and you've never noticed. I do believe that he wants to marry you, since to him, you're a goddess. But men like him are all the same, longing for what they could never get. Once you're with him for a few years, he'll get bored of you and cheat. I've seen plenty of scumbags like him.\"</p><p>\"I know that, Lingling.\"</p><p>\"Right, I'm just reminding you.\"</p><p>As she hung up Lingling's call, Huo Mian noticed that she had arrived at Fourth People's Hospital.</p><p>Huo Mian brought some buns and egg soup with her into the room.</p><p>\"Mom, you must be hungry.

We'll leave as soon as your blood pressure lowers.\"</p><p>\"When are you getting married? I heard Zhixin say that you bought an apartment already,\" Yang Meirong asked unhurriedly.</p><p>Although Ning Zhiyuan rarely visited Yang Meirong while he dated Huo Mian, she had not given him any trouble. At most, she was unenthusiastic.</p><p>\"We aren't anymore,\" answered Huo Mian, slightly biting her lip.</p><p>Yang Meirong paused from eating the bun and looked up with a sharp glare, \"What happened?\"</p><p>\"Zhiyuan likes someone else now,\" Huo Mian answered selectively, not wanting to take the blame. She thought that her mother would be triggered upon hearing Qin Chu's name so she did her best to avoid doing so.</p><p>However, Yang Meirong sneered and asked, \"Is it because he likes someone else? Or is it because you rekindled your love for that boy?\"</p><p>\"Mom, I didn't.\" Huo Mian's face paled, as she did not think that her mother would be so direct.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I am telling you that you will have a stable life if you marry someone as average as Ning Zhiyuan. It's been seven years, and I thought you've come to know your place. I can't believe that you are still so delusional, so obsessed with that Qin Chu. I'm telling you, you're digging yourself a shallow grave. Keep in mind that his parents basically tried to kill you seven years ago, and you're only alive because your Uncle Jing saved you. If they found out that you're still hooking up with their son, you might as well be dead.\"</p><p>\"Mom, I won't. Don't be angry,\" Huo Mian said as she reached out to hold her mother's hand.</p><p>\"Go away!

I guess everyone makes different decisions,\" answered Huo Mian with a bitter smile. </p><p>\"I've been observing you for the six months that you've been here. Your work ethic is great, you're quite bright and gifted, and you can understand medical principles quickly. I think it's a waste for you to continue like this. Each year, our hospital sends talented individuals to study abroad, and there's one spot for this opportunity in our department. Applications start in July of this year, and you will get the chance to spend eight months in Canada. If you're interested…\" </p><p>\"Thank you, head nurse, but I really don't need it. Let someone else have this chance, I'm just... an ordinary nurse.\" </p><p>After she finished, Huo Mian bowed to the head nurse with great respect and then turned around to leave. </p><p>The head nurse looked at Huo Mian as she walked away, and she was a bit confused.  </p><p>She didn't understand why an unbelievably talented youth like her would choose to kill her own dream. </p><p>- On the other side of town, inside the president's office at GK Headquarters - </p><p>A middle-aged man dressed in a black suit sat on the sofa and faced Qin Chu, who was sitting across from him. </p><p>He was the middle-aged man who arrived with eight special agents at the Qin Manor that morning to pick Qin Chu up. </p><p>\"Doctor Qin, the official's surgery went extremely well. After the critical period last night, our military aircraft already transported him back to Jing City to rest and recover. Please allow me to thank you on behalf of the official. I am also following the official's orders to speak with you, and to find out if there's anything we could help you with.\" </p><p>\"Are you offering me a reward as a thank you?\" Qin Chu replied with a question of his own. </p><p>\"Yes, I am. If there's anything you need, let us know, and we'll do our best.\" </p><p>\"Then what do you suppose I lack right now?\" Qin Chu asked again. </p><p>The middle-aged man froze and had no clue how to respond. As the President of GK Corporation, Qin Chu really didn't seem like someone who was in need of anything. </p><p>After a while, the middle-aged man took out an envelope of files and set it on the table. With a light cough, he said, \"Someone as prestigious as you indeed lacks nothing, but we found out that you, 27 years old, do not have a girlfriend. Therefore, we've especially compiled a file of all the socialites who live in the three nearby provinces. They all have dignified family backgrounds and are exceptionally beautiful. Please look through these files closely, and let me know if you like any of them. I'll make sure to take care of it.\"</p><p>\"So, you mean that your boss's reward for me is to help find me a girlfriend?\" asked Qin Chu coldly after laying eyes on the files.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":35,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:55.647","Link":"Chapter-35","NameDisplay":"Chapter 35"},{"ID":1811209475752920,"Name":"Chapter 36: Fame and Fortune","NameUnsign":"Chapter 36: Fame and Fortune","Description":"<p>Chapter 36: Fame and Fortune</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Uhm, in theory, you could say so,\" said the middle-aged man sternly, although a little awkwardly. </p><p>It frustrated him to speak with this kid, who also happened to be a young doctor and the president of a business empire. </p><p>\"Then can you tell me, who in the world told you that I don't have a girlfriend?\" Qin Chu asked the middle-aged man as he crossed his arms and stared at him. </p><p>The middle-aged man froze for a second. Then, he immediately took out another set of documents, looked it over, and raised his head to respond, \"We did some research, Doctor Qin. Over the past few years, we noticed that you were not overly intimate with any women.\" </p><p>\"Then why didn't you just suspect that I was gay?\" Qin Chu continued to ask.  </p><p>\"Because according to our investigations, you haven't had much contact with any men as well,\" the middle-aged man responded with great sincerity. </p><p>Qin Chu was left speechless; it seemed like these people had conducted quite a thorough investigation of him. They had even looked into all of the men and women around him, perhaps also investigated all but his ancestors. </p><p>\"Take these documents away, I don't need any socialites,\" said Qin Chu pridefully. He wasn't desperate to the point of going on blind dates yet, was he? Maybe he didn't have a hundred women falling for him over the past few years, but at least eighty women had proclaimed their love for him. These admirers came in various forms, but they all failed to meet his standards. </p><p>\"Why are you refusing? This is our official's way of showing gratitude.\" </p><p>\"Then let me ask, does your official have the right to kidnap a woman, and force her into marrying me?\" Qin Chu asked in all seriousness. </p><p>The middle-aged man's lips slightly twitched at his question. </p><p>\"I… don't think so.\" No matter how powerful his boss was, he still could not lawfully kidnap someone and force her into marriage. It was strictly forbidden, as the country valued human rights. </p><p>\"Then forget it. I am in love with someone, but since you guys can't kidnap her and make her marry me, then there's no need to say anything else.\" </p><p>\"Then perhaps we can help in other ways…?\" </p><p>\"It's fine, I don't need any help, you are free to go,\" Qin Chu invited his guest to leave. </p><p>The middle-aged man sighed slightly and thought, this young kid didn't even tell me what he wanted, how am I supposed to return to my boss without accomplishing my mission? </p><p>Therefore, he decided to take matters into his own hand... </p><p>- Three days later - </p><p>C City suddenly released an official statement: three days ago, a certain high-level official visited Jing City to examine the city's economic situation. The official expressed his satisfaction towards one of the leading enterprises, GK Corporation, after an in-depth visit. </p><p>After the release of this statement, major media outlets began reprinting and reposting it... </p><p>At the same time, GK Corporation's stocks grew by 25% by the end of that day.</p><p>Qin Yumin was overwhelmed with joy when he saw this news. It seemed like handing GK over to his son was the right choice. </p><p>He had no clue how his son managed to come into contact with this certain Jing City official, but his corporation definitely benefited from it. </p><p>- In the evening - </p><p>It was already 8:30 PM when Qin Chu returned home. </p><p>\"Chu, have you eaten yet?\" Mrs. Qin asked enthusiastically. </p><p>\"I have,\" replied Qin Chu as he headed towards the stairs. </p><p>\"Chu, I saw the news today, and you've clearly proved me wrong. I'm very curious as to how you came into contact with this mysterious official,\" Qin Yumin asked formally as he laid down the newspaper. </p><p>\"With my life on the line.\" Qin Chu turned around to head upstairs after this brief answer. </p><p>It was the truth - if something wrong happened during that surgery, then he would have ended up in jail and been forced to eat rice gruel for the rest of his life. </p><p>Many admired, were envious or even hated one's exceptional exterior, but only a few knew how much effort was put in behind one's radiant façade. </p><p>\"What is with his attitude?\" Qin Yumin was angry. </p><p>\"Yumin, our son is very busy with work lately, please understand. The corporation is now developing at a stable pace, isn't this what you've wanted the most?\" Mrs. Qin spoke in favor of her son. </p><p>- At First People's Hospital - </p><p>During her night shift, Huo Mian just happened to come across Ning Zhiyuan in the hall.</p><p>He seemed to have just gotten off work. He was in a blue t-shirt, paired with beige khakis and white sneakers; he looked quite clean and put together. </p><p>On that note, she had forgotten that they hadn't seen each other for several days.</p><p>\"Huo Mian,\" he stopped her. </p><p>She raised her head and looked at Ning Zhiyuan with calm eyes, as if she was looking at any other colleague. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was somewhat disappointed at Huo Mian's reaction, as he thought that she would have been at least happy to see him.</p><p>\"Did you need me for something?\" Huo Mian asked calmly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":36,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:57.053","Link":"Chapter-36","NameDisplay":"Chapter 36"},{"ID":181120947578431061,"Name":"Chapter 37: Police Station","NameUnsign":"Chapter 37: Police Station","Description":"<p>Chapter 37: Police Station</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Oh, nothing, I suddenly remembered that I left some things at our old place. You can give it to me when you have the time.\" </p><p>\"Okay, I'll look around when I get back,\" Huo Mian nodded and replied.  </p><p>\"You could just give it to He Man,\" Ning Zhiyuan added, just to piss her off. </p><p>However, Huo Mian wasn't surprised at all when she heard this. Instead, she casually responded, \"Sure.\" </p><p>Then, Huo Mian walked right past him. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan suddenly felt uncomfortable; he would be lying if he claimed that he had no feelings left for Huo Mian. After all, it took him a while before she agreed to go out with him. </p><p>They had been together for three years, and he had always treated her very well. Now that they suddenly broke up, it was only natural for him to be upset. </p><p>He originally thought that Huo Mian must have felt terrible as well, since he was now dating He Man. </p><p>Yet, there were clearly no signs of heartbreak in Huo Mian's expression back there. </p><p>Could this mean…that in all of these years, she never truly loved him? Perhaps she only loved that ex-boyfriend of hers? </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's eyes then turned colder and colder at the thought of this. </p><p>Huo Mian returned home after work, and she bought some health supplements for her mother since her mother had just been discharged from the hospital. However, because her mother never appreciated her presence, she simply dropped the things off and left without even staying for dinner. </p><p>Then, she returned to her rented apartment, thoroughly cleaned the place, and found the things that Ning Zhiyuan had left behind. </p><p>She carefully gathered his possessions and placed them in a bin, as she planned to take it with her to work the next day. </p><p>Exhausted, she lied down on her bed and used her phone to transfer funds into her maxed-out credit card. Thankfully it wasn't overdue, or else the fees would have been staggeringly high. </p><p>Then, she sent a WeChat message to Zhu Lingling. </p><p>\"Are you there?\" </p><p>\"Yup.\" </p><p>\"Give me your bank account number, I'm going to pay you back.\" </p><p>\"What's the rush? I'm not in a hurry,\" Zhu Lingling replied. </p><p>\"You may not be, but I am. It sucks to owe others money.\" </p><p>\"Where did you get all that money? Did Ning Zhiyuan return your share of the down payment?\" asked Zhu Lingling. </p><p>\"Yes,\" Huo Mian only vaguely answered to avoid explaining too much. She didn't want to explain that the money was a reward for being a scrub nurse during Qin Chu's surgery. </p><p>\"Not bad. Okay, since you're this reliable, I'll lend you money without a word next time you ask.\" Zhu Lingling sent a smiley face over. </p><p>After Zhu Lingling sent over her bank account number, Huo Mian transferred the money.</p><p>After giving back what she owed, she only had two thousand yuan left for daily expenditures. However, she felt relieved. </p><p>Lying on her bed, she listened to the piano version of Pachelbel's Canon, suddenly noticing the beauty of such a simple life. </p><p>- Downtown, Criminal Police Department - </p><p>\"Captain Gao, we cracked down on a brothel tonight and arrested lots of people,\" said a young police officer fawningly. </p><p>Gao Ran patted the little cop on the shoulders and said, \"Good job, good work everyone.\" </p><p>\"Captain Gao, one of the clients was drunk when we arrested him. We asked him to provide a contact for bail, but he wouldn't give us a name. There is also a password on his phone and we can't unlock it, so we can't contact his family either. What should we do?\" </p><p>\"Let me check this out.\" Gao Ran walked towards the detention room. </p><p>He walked in to see a young man with red cheeks, and the smell of alcohol pierced his nose. </p><p>Gao Ran frowned, \"Where are his belongings? Bring them to me.\" </p><p>\"Here, Captain Gao,\" the little cop handed him a cell phone. </p><p>Gao Ran swiped up and noticed that the phone requested a fingerprint passcode. Without another word, he walked over to the drunkard, took his finger, and pressed it onto the phone. </p><p>The little cop on the side raised his thumb and complemented, \"Our captain sure has his ways.\"</p><p>After Gao Ran unlocked the phone, he frowned slightly when he saw an attractive woman's photo on the home screen.</p><p>\"…Huo Mian?\" Gao Ran mumbled to himself, not sure if he saw it right.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":37,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:57.843","Link":"Chapter-37","NameDisplay":"Chapter 37"},{"ID":181120947583111236,"Name":"Chapter 38: Released on Bail","NameUnsign":"Chapter 38: Released on Bail","Description":"<p>Chapter 38: Released on Bail</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Gao Ran recognized Huo Mian right away. First of all, she was the woman that his close friend, Qin Chu, once deeply loved. Secondly, Huo Mian hadn't changed much since high school, as she had only lost the naivety from back then.</p><p>He still remembered when Qin Chu dated Huo Mian seven years ago. They would often hang out and have dinner together.</p><p>Back then, Gao Ran's girlfriend was also one of the prettiest girls in their class. Qin Chu would bring Huo Mian along, and the four of them would grab food together quite often.</p><p>Now that he recalled these things, it seemed like ages had gone by.</p><p>Gao Ran flipped through the drunk's phone, and, sure enough, he found 'Mian' in his contact list.</p><p>Gao Ran guessed that this must be Huo Mian and that this man definitely had an intimate relationship with her since he was using her photo as his wallpaper.</p><p>Just then, Gao Ran suddenly had an idea…</p><p>He turned to the short cop beside him and asked, \"Did you search for his ID? What's his name?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Captain Gao, his name is Ning Zhiyuan.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Then, Gao Ran took the phone, walked out of the custody cell, and dialed Huo Mian's number.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huo Mian was listening to music, already half-asleep. It was already 11:30 PM.</p><p>She hazily woke up as her phone rang, but when she saw that it was from Ning Zhiyuan, she hesitated before picking it up.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, what's up?\" Her tone was slightly distant.</p><p>\"Hello, are you Miss Huo Mian?\" Gao Ran spoke formally.</p><p>\"I am, may I ask who you are?\"</p><p>\"I'm the captain of the downtown Criminal Police Division. We have arrested a john named Ning Zhiyuan during our anti-prostitution mission tonight, is he your friend? We found your contact information on his phone.\" Gao Ran deviously emphasized the word ' john 1  '.</p><p>Huo Mian was shocked. John? Ning Zhiyuan? How is that possible?</p><p>\"Miss Huo Mian, are you still there?\" asked Gao Ran.</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>\"Ning Zhiyuan is your friend, right?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Huo Mian replied.</p><p>\"Then can you come right now to bail him out?\"</p><p>After a brief moment, Huo Mian slowly responded, \"Okay, I'll head over now.\"</p><p>After the call ended, with a devilish smile on his face, Gao Ran took out his phone to dial another number. </p><p>Qin Chu was a night owl, and he often reviewed company documents and statistics at night in his study room. After that, he would have some coffee and analyze the stock market.</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Chu, this time you must treat me to a good meal.\"</p><p>\"Now? What time is it?\" Qin Chu looked at his watch. It's already midnight, what is wrong with this idiot?</p><p>\"Come to my police station right now, I have a surprise for you.\"</p><p>\"I'm not interested,\" Qin Chu immediately refused.</p><p>\"…\" Gao Ran was left speechless for a second. \"Hmm… don't regret it then. I'm telling you that if you don't come right now, you'll miss an exciting scene. Huo Mian will be here soon.\"</p><p>\"Who?\" Qin Chu's interest was fully aroused upon hearing Huo Mian's name.</p><p>\"Hurry up and get over here. Ha, it'll be a pity if you miss this.\" Gao Ran immediately hung up the phone after he finished talking.</p><p>Qin Chu got up, changed his clothes, and drove his Audi R8 towards downtown.</p><p>Huo Mian was nowhere to be seen when Qin Chu arrived at the station.</p><p>Gao Ran stood at the door, and stated triumphantly, \"Just wait, Huo Mian will be here soon.\"</p><p>\"What is happening? It's already very late. Why would she come to a police station at this hour?\"</p><p>Qin Chu hurried over, not because he wanted to see Huo Mian, but because he was worried. Why would a girl like Huo Mian come to a place like this so late? Was she in trouble?</p><p>Just as Gao Ran was about to respond, he saw a slim girl walk in.</p><p>Her long black hair and a beige sweater made her look very attractive.</p><p>Qin Chu also noticed, his eyes immediately looked towards the door.</p><p>\"Hello, I just received a call. I'm here to bail Ning Zhiyuan out.\" Huo Mian's voice sounded slightly hoarse, and she didn't look like she was feeling well.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":38,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:58.313","Link":"Chapter-38","NameDisplay":"Chapter 38"},{"ID":181120947587969775,"Name":"Chapter 39: Framed?","NameUnsign":"Chapter 39: Framed?","Description":"<p>Chapter 39: Framed?</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Okay, come over and fill out this form.\" One of the cops led Huo Mian to the side. </p><p>Qin Chu was silent; no one could tell what he was thinking about. </p><p>\"So? Crazy right? I didn't even think it would be so coincidental, but who knew that Huo Mian's boyfriend would be amongst the johns we had just arrested?\" </p><p>\"They broke up already,\" Qin Chu calmly said. </p><p>\"Ha, how did you know that? Your news is sure up to date,\" laughed Gao Ran. </p><p>Qin Chu fell silent, but his eyes never left Huo Mian… </p><p>After Huo Main paid two thousand yuan in bail, she sighed… </p><p>The last two thousand yuan left over from her bonus was gone now. Luckily, she was getting paid in several days, or else she wouldn't be able to survive. </p><p>After she paid the money, she went into the cell. Ning Zhiyuan was still drunk and had already dozed off. There were red lipstick prints on his clothes. </p><p>She understood that he had started dating He Man out of spite. </p><p>However, Ning Zhiyuan at a brothel? That was completely unexpected, since he had always appeared to be a gentleman. </p><p>\"You can take him home now. Teach him a good lesson, why would he do such a thing with such a pretty girlfriend? He really is taking you for granted,\" the cop went on incessantly. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded awkwardly. Then, she pulled Ning Zhiyuan up with all her might, and dragged him out. </p><p>Qin Chu immediately lost his cool when he saw Huo Mian holding up the drunk Ning Zhiyuan as they walked out. </p><p>\"Let me.\" Before Huo Mian could respond, Qin Chu pulled Ning Zhiyuan over and held him up himself. </p><p>\"Why are you here?\" </p><p>Huo Mian was incredibly surprised to see Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Are you...also…one of the arrested…johns?\" Huo Mian's face gradually turned pale. </p><p>If finding out that Ning Zhiyuan was at a brothel had only disappointed her, then knowing Qin Chu also being there would devastate her. </p><p>\"Are you kidding me?\" Qin Chu's face grew grim as he looked at Huo Mian and responded. </p><p>Just then, Gao Ran immediately walked over and explained, \"I called Chu over, I wanted to show him what his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend was like.\" </p><p>Huo Mian saw Gao Ran and looked at his police uniform. Then, she immediately realized what was happening.</p><p>She laughed mockingly, \"Do you having nothing else to do?\" </p><p>\"Huh? What are you talking about?\" Gao Ran replied with a wronged look. </p><p>Before he finished speaking, Huo Mian turned around and walked out in anger. </p><p>Qin Chu dragged Ning Zhiyuan and followed her out. </p><p>\"They are so odd, I don't even know if I did a good thing or not,\" Gao Ran said to himself as he stroked his chin. </p><p>After they walked out of the police bureau, Huo Mian turned around and said, \"Okay, give him to me.\" </p><p>\"What do you plan to do? Are you going to take him back to your place?\" </p><p>\"Where else am I supposed to take him? \" asked Huo Mian in response. </p><p>\"No, I won't allow it,\" Qin Chu said grimly. </p><p>Huo Mian felt baffled, \"Qin Chu, you have no say in the matter. Firstly, we're not dating. And secondly, I'm just here to bail Ning Zhiyuan out, as a friend.\" </p><p>\"Say no more, I'll make arrangements for him.\" Then, ignoring her objection, Qin Chu shoved Ning Zhiyuan into his Audi R8. </p><p>\"Hey, where are you taking him?\" asked Huo Mian anxiously.</p><p>\"To throw into the ocean and feed the sharks.\" Qin Chu drove away at a great speed.</p><p></p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":39,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:58.797","Link":"Chapter-39","NameDisplay":"Chapter 39"},{"ID":181120947592831901,"Name":"Chapter 40: Back in the Days","NameUnsign":"Chapter 40: Back in the Days","Description":"<p>Chapter 40: Back in the Days</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian was left alone standing in front of the police station, as the wind was blowing her hair into a terrible mess. She was the one that had bailed Ning Zhiyuan out, so what was all this about? </p><p>As Mian was torn between taking a taxi, which was too expensive, or taking a bus to First People's Hospital, the Audi R8 actually came back, just like magic. It had taken less than five minutes to leave and come back. </p><p>\"Get in.\" </p><p>\"How can you be back so soon? Where is he?\" </p><p>\"He is in the hotel up ahead,\" Qin Chu answered. </p><p>Huo Mian was speechless, Qin Chu's efficiency was truly… </p><p>\"Hurry up, get in.\" </p><p>Huo Mian stopped dawdling, opened the door, and got into the passenger's seat. </p><p>After a few silent moments, she slowly asked, \"Did you set up everything that happened today?\" </p><p>Qin Chu's hands slightly paused on the steering wheel. He turned his head and glanced at her, \"You think I did this to him?\" </p><p>Huo Mian didn't answer… </p><p>\"You think I would do something so absurd?\" Qin Chu asked again. </p><p>Huo Mian remained silent. But Qin Chu was right, someone like him would not do something like this under the table. </p><p>On the other hand, Gao Ran seemed like someone who would pull a stunt like this. After all, in Huo Mian's mind, he was always a restless guy, even seven years ago. </p><p>\"You might not, but your bro might.\" </p><p>The side of Qin Chu's mouth twitched, \"You think that the captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau would frame a normal citizen by arresting and accusing him of patronizing whorehouses?\" </p><p>\"He's a captain now?\" Huo Mian was surprised, as she never thought that Gao Ran would make it that far. </p><p>Now that she thought about it, it didn't make much sense for the captain of a bureau to do something like this. Even more, every time he was dispatched on a case, he would be surrounded by cops. If he wrongly accused someone, people would gossip. That wouldn't be a wise move. </p><p>Most importantly, as Huo Mian was filling out forms just then, she thought back to the policeman's reminder.</p><p>He said, \"Miss, your boyfriend is a repeat offender. It's not the first time he went whoring. When you get home, you'll have to sort him out.\" </p><p>Huo Mian was a little shocked by what she heard. She never thought that Ning Zhiyuan, who was so gentle and mild, would actually be a repeat offender of soliciting prostitutes. </p><p>Even if he was putting on a show, it was too much. Besides, doctors were supposed to be clean freaks, right? </p><p>How could he stomach sleeping with a prostitute? </p><p>The more Huo Mian thought about it, the more depressed she got. She decided that she would be better off not talking, so she turned her head aside to look out at the night view. </p><p>She never thought that one day, she could sit in Qin Chu's car again and be alone with him, traveling in the dim light of the night as if it was seven years ago. </p><p>The Audi R8 actually took less than 20 minutes to drive back to her apartment, but she felt like it took several hours… </p><p>Honestly, she didn't dare to face Qin Chu. Although she hated him, she knew clearly that sometimes, hate was born of love. </p><p>Otherwise, he would have been just a stranger to her when they met again. Why else would her heart beat so erratically? </p><p>\"Mian,\" he gently called her name. </p><p>Huo Mian turned her head, her eyes blurry. Maybe it was the atmosphere that night that completely tossed her heart about.</p><p>\"How have you been these past seven years?\" Qin Chu had been holding this question for a while now.

This was something he had already decided for this lifetime. It didn't matter if she agreed. </p><p>Arriving upstairs, Huo Mian took a shower and got ready for bed. Without knowing why, she walked over to the window and tugged a corner of the curtain open. </p><p>As she had expected, his car was still parked in the same spot. Qin Chu was leaning against it, unmoving. </p><p>Noticing that someone seemed to be standing by the window, Qin Chu raised his head and gazed up in delighted surprise. </p><p>Huo Mian immediately drew the curtains back into place as her heart began pounding in her chest. </p><p>She was tense all over, as though some unmentionable secret of hers had been discovered. </p><p>Why was this happening? Wasn't it all far in the past? Why was seeing him and looking into his eyes still making her so tense? </p><p>Lying in bed, Huo Mian tossed and turned, unable to sleep. </p><p>She already mentally worked through what was happening with Ning Zhiyuan, and she was able to see the situation calmly. The fact that they didn't end up together simply showed that it wasn't meant to be. She had done what she could to try and fix the problem. </p><p>She didn't owe him anything, either. </p><p>However, if Qin Chu continued to interject himself into her life all the time, what was she going to do? </p><p>Giving it some thought, she made a post on her WeChat friend circle. </p><p>\"In each person's life, they will encounter someone who they can't be with. We always lament that it was such an overwhelming and powerful love, one comparable even to the value of our lives. We believe the painful parting in the end to be the greatest regret in our lifetimes. As time moves on and the scenery changes, we look back upon those ridiculous times. You will realize that you must actually be thankful for the choices you had made back then. This is because, as I'm finally beginning to understand, the one you were unable to be with was, in truth, just the wrong person.\" </p><p>Not long after Huo Mian posted, she got up and went to the bathroom. </p><p>When she got back, she had already received several comments. </p><p>A few people liked her post, mostly co-workers working the night shift at the hospital. </p><p>The young nurse, Huang Yue wrote, \"Don't be sad, big sis Mian. You have your whole life ahead of you. Good luck.\" </p><p>Huo Mian responded below, \"Thanks little sis.\" </p><p>They treated each other like sisters because like Huo Mian, Huang Yue was also a graduate of C City Medical School's Advanced Nursing Program. </p><p>Her girl friend, Zhu Lingling commented, \"Girl, for once you're not on the night shift. Go to bed early. Don't overthink. Tomorrow is a new day.\" </p><p>Huo Mian wrote back, \"Girl, sometimes I really wish I could go to someplace where no one knows me and start over.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling immediately replied, \"You can't do that. Don't abandon me. You're my best friend.\" </p><p>After reading this, Huo Mian only replied with a smiley face and didn't say anything else. </p><p>Wei Dong commented below, \"Only by leaving the wrong person can you meet the right one. Don't give up on the whole forest just because one tree turned out slanted.\" </p><p>Likewise, Huo Mian only replied with a smiley face out of courtesy. </p><p>The truth was, sometimes, she really felt tired and wanted to start over somewhere else. However, it was impossible, because she still needed to take care of her mother and brother. Before her little brother starts working, she couldn't leave them behind. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't have work the next day, so she slept in. It wasn't until she heard the doorbell ringing that she finally got up. </p><p>When she saw Ning Zhiyuan, Huo Mian was still half-asleep. \"You're here to get your things, right?\" she muttered sleepily, \"I've already packed it all up for you.\"</p><p>\"Mian, I'm here to see you,\" Ning Zhiyuan said earnestly as he stared at Huo Mian.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":41,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:47:59.75","Link":"Chapter-41","NameDisplay":"Chapter 41"},{"ID":1811209480242615,"Name":"Chapter 42: The End","NameUnsign":"Chapter 42: The End","Description":"<p>Chapter 42: The End</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Oh, come inside. Give me a minute, I'm going to go wash up.\" Huo Mian opened the door to let Ning Zhiyuan in. </p><p>Walking inside, he slowly looked around this little home, and his chest filled with a complex mix of emotions. </p><p>He still remembered how excited he was when he had first moved in with Huo Mian. Even though they slept in separate rooms, the simple fact that they could be together from dawn to dusk filled him with joy. If it hadn't been for the incident at her high-school reunion, perhaps they would have held their wedding already. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan truly hated that ex-boyfriend of Huo Mian's. They broke up so many years ago, so why did he have to come running back and bother them? </p><p>If he was that rich, why didn't he just go and find another girlfriend? Why did he have to cling onto Huo Mian? </p><p>Huo Mian got dressed, then went to the bathroom to wash up. When she came out, she saw Ning Zhiyuan was sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper. </p><p>\"What did you want to see me about?\" Drying her hair, Huo Mian walked out into the room. </p><p>\"Thank you for bailing me out yesterday,\" Ning Zhiyuan opened his mouth and said awkwardly. </p><p>Huo Mian instantly knew what he was talking about and only calmly replied, \"It's nothing.\" </p><p>\"Mian, actually, I'm not normally like that. I was just in a bad mood yesterday. I was thinking about our past together, which was why I went drinking. After I got drunk, some woman took me out of the bar. I actually don't remember what happened after that. You have to believe me.\" </p><p>\"You shouldn't be explaining this to me. Your current girlfriend is He Man,\" Huo Mian reminded him. </p><p>\"Mian, you know I still have feelings for you. Over the past few years, you and I…\" </p><p>\"Zhiyuan, what are you trying to say?\" Huo Mian cut straight to the point. </p><p>\"Mian, I was in the wrong this time. You went through the trouble of picking me up last night and getting me to the hotel. I really feel that I've wronged you. He Man and I were just fooling around. It wasn't real. You're still the one I love. Let's wipe the slate clean, okay? I won't bring up the fact that you were still in contact with your ex-boyfriend anymore. I screwed up this time. Add that to the thing with He Man, and we can call it even. Let's go back to how things were before, alright?\" </p><p>Huo Mian put down her towel. \"Zhiyuan… Do you think life is a game? You mess up, and you can just start over?\" she asked, staring seriously into Ning Zhiyuan's eyes. </p><p>\"That's not what I was thinking. It took us time and effort to come together. Since we both have feelings for one another, why do we have to torture each other?\" </p><p>\"Zhiyuan, do you know what kind of person I hate the most?\" </p><p>\"What?\" Ning Zhiyuan asked. </p><p>\"Liars.\" </p><p>\"I didn't lie, Mian. Yesterday was really the first time I screwed up. I won't do it again.\" </p><p>\"But the policeman at the station told me that you had been taken to the station before. It wasn't your first time with a prostitute. You're a frequent offender.\" </p><p>When Huo Mian finished speaking, Ning Zhiyuan's face instantly drained of color. </p><p>It was a while before he was able to stammer out, \"Don't listen to those stinking policemen. They're all corrupt. They only arrest people for the money. They set me up.\" </p><p>\"Zhiyuan, that's not the point. The point is that we can't go back.\" </p><p>\"Why? You still want to be with your ex-boyfriend, don't you? Just because he has more money than me?\" Ning Zhiyuan was getting angry. </p><p>\"Don't bring him into this. It has nothing to do with him.\" </p><p>\"I don't believe you. You're definitely still in love with him. You can't forget him, can you?\" Ning Zhiyuan questioned. </p><p>\"Zhiyuan, I've explained already. You know that I never lie. It is what it is.\" </p><p>\"Then, there's no chance of us getting back together?\" Ning Zhiyuan asked, distraught. </p><p>Huo Mian remained silent. </p><p>\"Alright, I understand.\" With that, Ning Zhiyuan took out a wad of cash from his bag and placed it on the coffee table. </p><p>\"I heard that you spent two thousand on my bail yesterday and another thousand for the hotel room. Altogether, it's three thousand. Here, I don't want to owe you anything. We're even now. Huo Mian, I'm warning you. Since you've made your decision today, don't regret it. When that rich boy doesn't want you anymore, when he's done toying with you, don't you come begging me to take you back. I've given you a chance, and you're the one who threw it away.\" </p><p>Hearing this, Huo Mian felt somewhat speechless. </p><p>After Ning Zhiyuan finished talking, he turned around and opened the door to leave. </p><p>\"Hey, you haven't taken your stuff yet.\" </p><p>\"I don't want it. Throw it away,\" Ning Zhiyuan huffed before slamming the door behind him. </p><p>This time, it's really over, right? Huo Main thought.</p><p>Just then, her cell phone rang. Huo Mian turned around to reach for it.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":42,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:00.243","Link":"Chapter-42","NameDisplay":"Chapter 42"},{"ID":1811209480712789,"Name":"Chapter 43: Memorial","NameUnsign":"Chapter 43: Memorial","Description":"<p>Chapter 43: Memorial</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Zhixin.\" When Huo Mian picked up the phone, her voice took on a doting tone.</p><p>\"Sis, are you off work today?\" </p><p>\"Yeah.\" </p><p>\"Then let's go sweep Dad's grave together at noon.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian was planning to go even if Zhixin hadn't called. </p><p>It had been exactly seven years since Uncle Jing passed away. It was on this day, seven years ago, that Uncle Jing died from that fatal car crash. </p><p>\"I already went with Mom this morning and her mood wasn't great. I'll go with you again at noon.\" </p><p>\"Don't you have classes today?\" </p><p>\"Nope. I'm going to the library to study in the afternoon.\" </p><p>\"Alright, wait for me. We'll meet at the gates of the public cemetery.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>Hanging up, Huo Mian's mood instantly grew heavy. </p><p>She still remembered that night seven years ago. She was on her way home from her evening classes when a black Buick commercial van came charging at her, too quick for her to dodge. </p><p>It was then that Uncle Jing, who was there to pick her up from school, suddenly charged over and pushed her aside. </p><p>In the end, she could only watch as Uncle Jing died under the wheels of that car. His blood formed a stream on the pavement. </p><p>She only sustained minor injuries and a few scrapes, but the accident cost Uncle Jing his life. </p><p>If it were not for her, Uncle Jing wouldn't have died. </p><p>Originally, she had thought that it was just an accident. However, she was left dumbstruck when she later learned that the driver responsible for the crash was the Qin Family's chauffeur. </p><p>How audacious was the Qin Family that they couldn't even be bothered to cover up the fact that they paid for someone to be killed? Did they really need to send their own chauffeur to do their dirty work? </p><p>These rich people really didn't give a damn about ordinary citizens. Her mother and younger brother were both heartbroken. </p><p>Time and time again, she had gone to court, suing the offending driver. By then, the Qin Family had already sent Qin Chu out of the country. </p><p>She, on the other hand, had been left to carry an unbearable burden all by herself. In the end, Huo Mian and her family insisted on rejecting the compensation. </p><p>The offending driver had had no choice but to take the charges and go to prison. However, he was only charged with drunk driving and was given a measly sentence of five years. </p><p>It was that moment when she profoundly felt the unfairness of it all and the difference between those with money and those without. </p><p>Furthermore, she understood that, with a background like hers, she would never be able to mingle with a wealthy family with connections like the Qins. </p><p>It was also then that she completely abandoned all thoughts of being with Qin Chu. </p><p>Collecting those heavy memories, Huo Mian splashed some water on her face. Changing into a pair of black pants, a black t-shirt, and a pair of black sunglasses, she walked out the door. As she passed the flower shop along the way, she stopped to purchase a bouquet of white chrysanthemums. </p><p>The public cemetery was located in the city outskirts, and it took three bus transfers just to get there. It was already close to noon when she arrived at the gates. </p><p>\"Sis.\" Jing Zhixin waved at Huo Mian from a ways off. </p><p>\"You've been waiting for a while, haven't you?\" Huo Mian patted his head affectionately. </p><p>\"Not long, just fifteen minutes or so. Sis, you seem to have lost weight recently. Have you been working too many night shifts?\" </p><p>Huo Mian only smiled gently at her brother's concern, \"No, I'm on a diet.\" </p><p>After that, the two walked into the public cemetery together. They placed the fresh flowers she had bought earlier before Uncle Jing's gravestone. </p><p>There were also fruits and a flower basket that their mother had left when she visited in the morning. </p><p>\"Zhixin, over the past few years, have you ever blamed me like Mom does?\" Taking off her sunglasses, Huo Mian's expression was sorrowful. </p><p>Jing Zhixin looked at his older sister. Perplexed, he exclaimed, \"Sis, what are you saying? Why would I do that? What happened back then wasn't your fault. The Qin family are the bad guys. If Dad hadn't died, you would have. You're both the closest people I have in my life.\" </p><p>\"But if I hadn't ignored the warnings and continued to date Qin Chu, this tragedy wouldn't have occurred.\" Huo Mian bit her lip, her chest filled with guilt.</p><p>To this, Jing Zhixin's reply completely shocked Huo Mian. She could hardly believe that her nineteen-year-old brother was capable of saying something like that.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":43,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:00.713","Link":"Chapter-43","NameDisplay":"Chapter 43"},{"ID":18112094812226504,"Name":"Chapter 44: Accident","NameUnsign":"Chapter 44: Accident","Description":"<p>Chapter 44: Accident</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Jing Zhixin said, \"Sis, love isn't wrong, and the fault isn't with you. The Qin family is despicable to use such underhanded tactics to force you two apart back then. The truth is, you were hurt inside too, weren't you? You're also still deeply in love with Qin Chu, right?\" </p><p>\"Zhixin…\" Huo Mian suddenly didn't know what to say. </p><p>\"I'm not just a kid that knows nothing. Also, I know about your breakup with Zhiyuan. The other day, I called him. I knew from his tone that something wasn't right. Even though he didn't say it directly, I knew something was wrong between the two of you. Before Mom ended up in the hospital, Qin Chu came to our home. Linking these two incidents together, I thought that maybe you never liked Zhiyuan, Sis. You're still in love with Qin Chu, and you can't let go. So, I won't blame you. Dad is dead, and the dead can't be brought back to life. All I hope is that Sis, you don't leave yourself with any more regrets from now on. Love isn't something you can force. I read in a magazine that love is something that only you know yourself. Zhiyuan might be a good guy, but you don't love him. I don't want my sister to spend the rest of her life with a man she doesn't love. If you still like Qin Chu, then be with him. Even if Mom doesn't approve it, even if she hates you or screams at you, I won't. I would understand. Blame should be placed on those responsible, and what the Qin Family did can't be pinned on Qin Chu. So, I'm going to say this again, I'll be happy as long as you are happy, Sis.\" </p><p>By the time Jing Zhixin finished speaking, Huo Mian's face was already streaked with tears. </p><p>She wasn't a crybaby. After breaking up with Ning Zhiyuan, she hadn't shed a single tear. </p><p>However, what her little brother said shook her to her core. </p><p>Her brother was only nineteen years old. How precious was it that he could put himself in her shoes and understand what she had been through. </p><p>She suddenly remembered a formerly-popular phrase, 'Most pay attention to how high you fly, but only those who care for you worry about how tired you must be.' </p><p>Her brother was such a sweet boy, always encouraging Huo Mian when she was down. </p><p>These past years, aside from supporting her little brother financially, Huo Mian felt like she really hadn't been a good sister. </p><p>At the very least, she never cared for or worried about her brother like he did for her, and she never paid attention to what her brother was really thinking about.</p><p>\"Sis, stop crying. You're not a kid anymore. Here, wipe your face, you look like a mess.\" Jing Zhixin handed her a pack of tissues. </p><p>Huo Mian dried her tears, though her breathing hadn't yet settled. </p><p>\"Zhixin, I never knew that you understood everything. Thank you for being so understanding.\" </p><p>\"What's this nonsense? We're siblings! You and Mom are the two people I love the most in the whole wide world.\" Jing Zhixin smiled, revealing a pair of little protruding canine teeth. </p><p>Huo Mian's tears twinkled as they caught the light. </p><p>She thought, Uncle Jing, please watch over Zhixin and I. Make it so that we will always be okay, no more disturbances. Neither of us can take any more loss. </p><p>It was already 1 PM when they walked out of the public cemetery.</p><p>\"Don't you have to go to the library to study?\" </p><p>\"I still have time. Sis, I'm so hungry. Let's go eat something.\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>After that, the two took the bus back into the city and found a little restaurant near Jing Zhixin's university. They ordered two dishes and soup. </p><p>Although the meal was simple, they still enjoyed it a lot. </p><p>Jing Zhixin was in the second semester of his freshman year. The university wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad either. It was technically a second-tier university. </p><p>He studied civil engineering and from what she had heard, he planned on becoming an engineer after graduation.</p><p>\"Sis, when I graduate and find a job, I can support our family alongside you. When that happens, you and Mom won't need to work so hard anymore.\" </p><p>\"Yeah.\" Huo Mian nodded with a smile on her face. </p><p>After lunch, Huo Mian bought some fruit for her brother and walked him all the way to his school gates.</p><p>\"Sis, go home already. Call me if anything comes up,\" Jing Zhixin said, waving goodbye at Huo Mian. </p><p>When Huo Mian returned to her apartment, she spent the entire afternoon doing a thorough cleaning of the place. As someone in the medical field, she was obsessed with hygiene. </p><p>It was nearly 6 PM by the time she finished. </p><p>Exhausted, she curled up on the couch, watching TV to pass the time. Right then, her phone rang. Peering at the caller-ID, she saw that it was an unfamiliar number. </p><p>\"Are you Jing Zhixin's sister?\" the boy on the other end sounded frantic as he asked. </p><p>\"I am.\" </p><p>\"I'm Jing Zhixin's roommate. Jing Zhixin was just in a car accident on campus. He is on his way to the First Hospital for emergency care. You should hurry over.\"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Huo Mian felt her vision swim.

You have got to be okay. How will mom live with herself otherwise?\" As though she was unable to see Huo Mian, Yang Meirong continued to wail with her eyes closed. </p><p>Two young nurses walked over, intending on scolding her to keep it down. They were surprised when they saw Huo Mian. \"Huo Mian, are you the patient's family, too?\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, her face pale. \"Weiwei, how's my little brother? What's the situation?\" </p><p>\"We don't know yet. But it was pretty scary when they brought him in. His heart rate was irregular, and his blood pressure was frighteningly high… The attending is trying to save him. You have to wait for now.\" </p><p>\"Okay, I understand.\" </p><p>Huo Mian felt the strength drain out of her body; she was close to collapsing. </p><p>They were just eating lunch together around noon, chatting and laughing. How could something like this happen in the same afternoon? </p><p>If anything were to happen to Zhixin, she couldn't imagine how she and her mother could continue living on this Earth. </p><p>Seven years ago, Uncle Jing's death had already veiled their family in a sheet of frost. If something were to happen to her brother now, she was afraid that she would lose the courage to live.</p><p>By now, she noticed that other families were crying outside the operating room, and only then did it occur to her to ask what happened.</p><p>A middle-aged man, about forty years old and wearing gold-rimmed glasses, walked over. </p><p>Huo Mian recognized him. He was Jing Zhixin's university professor. </p><p>\"Professor Sun, what in the world happened?\" </p><p>\"From what I heard, Jing Zhixin was involved in a car accident on his way back to his dorm from the library. He wasn't the only one injured. There were three other students who sustained serious injuries. It was classified as a chain reaction collision.\" The professor's tone was grave. </p><p>Huo Mian stiffened for a second. </p><p>\"How could that be? Isn't there a speed limit on campus? At such low speeds, how could such a serious car accident have taken place?\" </p><p>\"I wasn't present when it happened. We need to wait for the surveillance footage to be processed to know the details. But from what student witnesses said, a Porsche sports car was speeding. It caused significant damage to the university's infrastructure, hitting and injuring four students before slamming into a tree.\" </p><p>\"A Porsche sports car?\" Huo Mian's brows furrowed. She couldn't imagine who could race a sports car through a university campus, packed with students, and cause damage to the infrastructure. </p><p>\"What about the perpetrator? Where are they?\" Huo Mian was filled with rage. </p><p>\"He ran away. I heard that the girl in the passenger seat of his car was also seriously hurt and is undergoing emergency care at the hospital. However, the school already called the police. They are now investigating, so you don't need to worry.\" </p><p>\"How could I not worry when I don't know how my little brother is doing?\" As she spoke, Huo Mian's tears began to fall. </p><p>Three hours later, the doors to the operating room opened. </p><p>Huo Mian and her mother dashed up to the doctor at once, blocking his path. </p><p>\"Doctor Liu, how is my brother?\" </p><p>\"The situation doesn't look good, we've already done what we can to save him. However, there is hemorrhaging within his cranium. In addition, the location of the bleeding is extremely sensitive. We don't have full confidence in proceeding with a second operation. In a moment, the department of neurosurgery will come up with a plan. We'll discuss how to proceed with treatment with the family members then.\" </p><p>Hearing this, both Huo Mian and her mother felt their knees give way under them. </p><p>'The situation doesn't look good' meant that he hadn't stabilized yet. </p><p>She understood the theory behind cranium hemorrhaging. The surgery that Qin Chu performed with her before was for a patient who was suffering from this condition. </p><p>It was a technically-demanding procedure, and the slightest mistake could result in lasting side-effects. Less severe cases could result in decreased cognitive function or compromised motor movements. Severe cases could outright cause paralysis or leave the patient in a coma. </p><p>\"Heavens, my poor baby boy. What have I done to deserve this?\" Yang Meirong wailed, kneeling onto the ground.</p><p>At that moment, Huo Mian felt the sky fall down around her.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":45,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:01.663","Link":"Chapter-45","NameDisplay":"Chapter 45"},{"ID":18112094821419677,"Name":"Chapter 46: Emergent Rescue","NameUnsign":"Chapter 46: Emergent Rescue","Description":"<p>Chapter 46: Emergent Rescue</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Keep your voices down.

Such bad karma!\" Yang Meirong was crying and throwing punches at Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian herself was morose, and she had no words to offer… </p><p>Then, Yang Meirong suddenly grabbed Huo Mian's collar and yelled, \"Did the Qin family do it? Huh? Is this another retaliation because you're going after their son again? Tell me, tell me now!\" </p><p>\"Mom, calm down.

I'll kill them!\" When she finished, Yang Meirong ran towards the exit. </p><p>\"Mom…\" Huo Mian held her mother's hand tightly, sobbing. </p><p>Finally, her mother leaned forward and collapsed… </p><p>\"Mom, stay with me.\" Huo Mian felt like her brain was going to explode. </p><p>Her brother was not out of danger yet, and now her mom had fainted. Huo Mian had taken two hits and was on the brink of falling apart.</p><p>After making arrangements for her mother, Huo Mian pulled herself together and walked towards the top floor of the hospital. </p><p>- At the hospital director's door - </p><p>\"I want to see the director,\" Huo Mian said to the male assistant. </p><p>\"Do you have an appointment?\" </p><p>\"No.\" </p><p>The assistant met Huo Mian last time so he knew who she was. He nodded, \"Wait here for a second and I'll speak with him.\" </p><p>Shortly, the assistant came out, \"You can go in now.\" </p><p>\"Thank you.\" </p><p>Huo Mian saw the director sitting in his chair when she walked in, presumably writing a report of some sort. </p><p>\"Director Wu.\" </p><p>\"Oh, you're here. Take a seat.\" The director wasn't a stranger to this uniform. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, her eyes red. She sat down on the chair across from the director. </p><p>\"You are here for something. Tell me.\" The director thought she came with demands because he hadn't given her a big enough bonus last time. </p><p>Unexpectedly, Huo Mian burst into tears as soon as she started talking, \"Director, ple-please save my brother.\" </p><p>\"What's going on, slow down, take your time,\" he said with a grave tone. Seeing her like this, Director Wu stopped what he was doing and adjusted his glasses. </p><p>\"Director, my brother was in a car accident today at school and was sent to our hospital for emergency care. The lead surgeon said that he suffered severe brain damage. After the emergency surgery, he's still not out of danger, so the doctor suggested a second surgery. But because his injuries are in a crucial part of the brain, the second surgery is extremely risky. He's only nineteen and he's my only brother. I don't want to lose him. Please help me.\" </p><p>\"I see. Don't worry. Let me make a phone call and ask.\" </p><p>Soon after, Director Wu dialed the Neurosurgery Department extension and spoke to the doctor there. </p><p>After a few minutes, Director Wu hung up the phone and said with a heavy tone, \"Huo Mian, your brother's situation is complicated. Doctor Liu from the Neurosurgery Department told me that he has little confidence in this surgery. Besides, even if the surgery is successful, there may be side effects.\" </p><p>\"Then what should we do? What if we don't do the second surgery? Would that be better for him?\" Huo Mian was worried. </p><p>Director Wu shook his head, \"Listen to me, here is the thing: If we don't do the second surgery, his life will always be in danger. If the blood clots in his brain aren't removed completely, they may lead to a massive hemorrhage in his brain at any time. This is very serious.\" </p><p>\"Then what should we do?\" Huo Mian was struck dumb. For the first time, she felt out of her wits. </p><p>\"Here, go back and think about it. Also, talk to your family and consult with them. But I need to remind you that the second surgery will be very costly. It will be at least three hundred thousand yuan and the best window to do this surgery is within a week. Otherwise, the longer we wait, the greater the risks. As to the current hospitalization costs, you don't have to worry about that. I already put in prior notice, so you don't have to pay the bill right away. It can wait and be taken care of in the future. But go and talk to your family about the second surgery. That is the most important decision to make right now.\" </p><p>\"Thank you, Director. I will go and think about it.\" </p><p>Then, Huo Mian stood up muddle-headed… Three hundred thousand yuan, it was a steep price. Where would she find all that money? </p><p>\"Wait,\" the director called out suddenly. </p><p>Huo Mian turned her exhausted head…</p><p>\"Huo Mian, the guest surgeon that performed the surgery for that senior official, Dr. Qin, is an old friend of yours, right?\" This pivotal question had just then come to Director Wu's mind.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":46,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:02.143","Link":"Chapter-46","NameDisplay":"Chapter 46"},{"ID":18112094826381804,"Name":"Chapter 47: Raising Money","NameUnsign":"Chapter 47: Raising Money","Description":"<p>Chapter 47: Raising Money</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>After hesitating for a few seconds, Huo Mian nodded her head; she knew that she could not hide this from the director. </p><p>\"Yes, we know each other from before,\" she said, trying to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial. </p><p>\"That makes things easier. If you are friends, I suggest that you ask Dr. Qin to perform the surgery for your brother. You should know that he is a doctor from Harvard. With the assistance of the lead surgeon at our hospital, your brother's surgery will have a higher chance of success. What do you think?\" </p><p>\"Em, I'll think about it. Thanks for your reminder.\" </p><p>After they finished talking, Huo Mian turned around and left the director's office… Her mood was complicated beyond compare. </p><p>Should she ask for Qin Chu's help? She would rather die. Maybe she should gather the money first. After all, 300,000 yuan was no small sum. </p><p>- Inside the patient's room - </p><p>Her mother was already awake when Huo Mian walked in, and she looked like she was still in a bad mood. </p><p>\"Mom, I have something to talk to you about,\" Huo Mian started softly. </p><p>Yang Meirong turned her pale face away and did not respond. </p><p>\"I just went to the hospital director's office and asked about Zhixin's situation. The director also suggested another surgery, but it's very expensive. It'll cost 300,000 yuan.\" </p><p>\"We will save Zhixin even if we have to sell our house and property. What good is money?\" Yang Merong said resolutely, staring at Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, \"I was thinking of the same thing. I will do anything to save Zhixin. Mom, take care of yourself and leave the rest to me. I'll go get the money first.\" </p><p>\"Sell the house, we can rent,\" Yang Meirong said in a muffled voice as she lowered her head. </p><p>\"We don't have enough time to sell the house, since the second surgery must be performed within a few days. Let me find a way. Take care of yourself and get better soon.\" </p><p>After she finished talking, Huo Mian left her mom's room… </p><p>She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself. Then, she took out her phone and scrolled through each of her contacts, trying to see if anyone could help her at this very moment. </p><p>Then, she thought of someone - Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>But it wasn't because she had no choice but to borrow money from him. It was just that when they bought the apartment, Huo Mian took 60,000 yuan from her own savings for the down payment. </p><p>She didn't have a handsome salary, and that 60,000 was saved up from another part time job she worked at while she worked full-time at the hospital. It wasn't easy. </p><p>So she wanted to ask Ning Zhiyuan if he could give her that money back. </p><p>Soon after, she went to Ning Zhiyuan's newly-purchased apartment. </p><p>She hadn't been there much. They planned to move in after they got married but they broke up, so it was unsettled. </p><p>It was a 33-floor apartment building right on the Third Ring Road, so the traffic was good, and it was convenient to get around. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan lived on the ninth floor. Huo Mian took the elevator to the ninth floor and stopped before Unit 902. </p><p>Just as she was about to knock, she saw that the door wasn't closed all the way…</p><p>She slowly opened the door. As she walked in, she saw a pair of female heels by the doorstep. They were purple and very sexy. </p><p>She then heard flirty voices coming from inside the bedroom… </p><p>\"Ugh, you haven't showered yet! Hurry, you're disgusting~\" </p><p>\"No rush. I'll shower after we're done here,\" Ning Zhiyuan bantered. </p><p>Huo Mian realized that she came at the wrong time, and perhaps she shouldn't ask him. </p><p>Right as she was about to turn around and leave, she knocked over a pair of shoes on the shoe rack and made quite a noise. </p><p>\"Who is it?\" Ning Zhiyuan immediately walked out from the bedroom to check. </p><p>Seeing Huo Mian, he was a little surprised and awkward, \"You…why are you here?\"</p><p>Huo Mian saw Ning Zhiyuan half naked, wearing nothing but a pair of boxers. She immediately turned her head away, \"My family has something going on and we need money. So, I just came to ask if you can give me back the money that I put in for the down payment.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":47,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:02.64","Link":"Chapter-47","NameDisplay":"Chapter 47"},{"ID":18112094832071422,"Name":"Chapter 48: Asking for Help","NameUnsign":"Chapter 48: Asking for Help","Description":"<p>Chapter 48: Asking for Help</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Money? It's all gone. We used it to buy this apartment. If you want it, you will have to wait until I save up. When I do, I'll pay you back.\"</p><p>\"Okay, fine.\" After speaking, Huo Mian turned to leave.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, what happened?\"</p><p>\"Zhixin was in a car accident.\" Huo Mian's voice was raspy.</p><p>\"You shouldn't come to me for something of this magnitude. You should go look for your rich ex-boyfriend,\" Ning Zhiyuan suddenly said.</p><p>Huo Mian did not reply, but her face was filled with disappointment. She turned around to leave.</p><p>After speaking, Ning Zhiyuan regretted his decision. Why did he have to pick on her like that?</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, whose voice was that? Why aren't you coming back in?\" A feminine voice rang out from the bedroom.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan actually still had money on his card. There was a hundred thousand yuan left in his account that he was going to use for the wedding.</p><p>If he gave this money to Huo Mian, would she be moved enough to get back together with him?</p><p>However, he also considered that there was the possibility that even if Huo Mian took his money, she would still refuse to get back together with him. That wouldn't be worth it.</p><p>Walking out of Ning Zhiyuan's apartment, Huo Mian got a call from Zhu Lingling.</p><p>\"Girl, I just got off the plane and saw your message. What happened, why do you need so much money?\" Zhu Lingling's voice sounded quite anxious.</p><p>\"Zhixin was in a car accident. He's in the hospital right now, and I need 300,000 yuan for the surgery.\"</p><p>At that moment, Huo Mian's voice could not be more hoarse.</p><p>\"What? Zhixin was in an accident? Don't panic, where are you? I'll go find you right now.\"</p><p>\"I'm at the Rainbow Business Building near Third Ring Road.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll see you in a bit.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling took a cab and got there in half an hour. She and Huo Mian found a KFC and sat down.</p><p>\"Lingling, I really am out of options.\"</p><p>\"What did the police say, what about the perpetrator?\"</p><p>\"They're still investigating. According to them, four or five students were hurt. My brother wasn't the only one, and that makes it difficult for the police to deal with. Waiting for compensation takes a long process, and Zhixin's surgery can't wait. We must get to it as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>\"I understand. How about this, I have about 80,000 yuan saved up, you can take it for now. I'll go ask my parents, relatives, and friends to lend me money. I think I can get you around a 130,000 yuan. We'll figure out the rest.\"</p><p>\"Thank you so much, Lingling.\" With red eyes, Huo Mian tightly held Zhu Lingling's hand.</p><p>\"You idiot, we're best friends. You don't have to thank me. If I don't help you now, when would I? Money doesn't matter, what's most important is that Zhixin is safe and healthy.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded...</p><p>\"Mian, why don't we ask the media? Once this goes public, we'll be able to gather enough from donations.\"</p><p>Huo Mian hesitated for a while before replying, \"I thought about that too. But, if we alert the media and blow up this incident, Zhixin will be under a lot of pressure once he recovers and returns to school. I don't want people to look at him with pity, do you understand? He's a boy after all, and is prideful. I want the media to be our last resort.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that's right. I didn't think it all the way through. It's fine, don't worry. We'll think of something.\"</p><p>After she and Zhu Lingling parted, Huo Mian returned to her apartment and washed her face.</p><p>Just then, a notification from WeChat popped up...</p><p>\"Goddess Huo, are you there?\" The message was from her high school classmate Wei Dong.</p><p>\"Yeah, what's up?\"</p><p>\"I heard from Zhu Lingling that your brother had a car accident and needs money for the surgery. Is that right?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"I have money, I can lend it to you.\"</p><p>\"Really? Thank you,\" Huo Mian excitedly replied.</p><p>\"Let's meet up and discuss it.\"</p><p>\"Sure.\" Huo Mian was ready to do anything for Zhixin.</p><p>At 6:30 PM, Huo Mian met Wei Dong at a Thai restaurant nearby.</p><p>He drove a black Mercedes-Benz GLK and was dressed in Armani. In his hand was a LV purse, and on his wrist was a Longines diamond watch. He looked like a spoiled rich kid.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, was dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans. It was simple yet elegant.</p><p>\"I hope I didn't keep you waiting for long,\" smiling, Wei Dong asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":48,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:03.207","Link":"Chapter-48","NameDisplay":"Chapter 48"},{"ID":18112094837267137,"Name":"Chapter 49: Condition","NameUnsign":"Chapter 49: Condition","Description":"<p>Chapter 49: Condition</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"Not really, I arrived a few minutes ago.\"</p><p>\"Let's order first, what do you want?\"</p><p>\"Anything will do, I don't really have an appetite.\"</p><p>\"Server, let's get a lover's combo, a fruit salad, and dessert.\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p><p>After ordering, Wei Dong turned to look at Huo Mian with a seemingly pleasant attitude.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, how is your brother doing right now?\"</p><p>\"It's not looking good, we're still waiting to undergo the second operation.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry, he'll get better.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><p>After some polite small talk, Wei Dong brought up the money topic.</p><p>\"I didn't bring the money today, it's not convenient for me to carry so much cash.

You are underestimating me.\"</p><p>\"I didn't mean it like that, I am just very thankful that… that you can help me.\"</p><p>\"Don't thank me, I actually have something else to say. Maybe you would find me despicable, but I'm being genuine here. Huo Mian, you don't have to pay me back, I only have one condition. Will you be my girlfriend?\"</p><p>Huo Mian's eyes faltered slightly; she was not too surprised. With her wits, she had already guessed what Wei Dong wanted.</p><p>There was no such thing as a free lunch, and all things came with a price.</p><p>\"But I heard from Lingling that you have a girlfriend. I don't want to be the third person in someone else's relationship,\" Huo Mian replied.</p><p>\"She doesn't count as a girlfriend, more like a friend with benefits. Those women are all cheap and despicable, dating me for my money and not for me. I obviously can't be loyal to them. But you are different, I've liked you since high school. Huo Mian, give me a chance, and I'll be good to you. I'm not just playing around, we can get engaged now and be married within a month. After we get married, I'll buy you a house and a car, and let you live comfortably. I'll care for your mom and brother forever too.\"</p><p>Getting emotional, Wei Dong reached out to hold Huo Mian's hand. However, before he had touched it, Huo Mian raised her hand and put it on her hair as if to fix it, avoiding the awkward contact.</p><p>\"Wei Dong, you don't like gold diggers or women who date you for your money. How could you be sure that I am not going to date you for that purpose? I am not a fairy, and I am not virtuous. I have my own greed and desires. Fairy tales and TV shows are fictitious, and perfect women like that don't exist. Don't have too much expectation and illusions for what I am not, as there is a difference between reality and fantasy.\"</p><p>Huo Mian had spoken these words to Wei Dong before, but it seemed like he did not take what she said seriously.</p><p>\"No, you're not like that. If you really are a gold digger, you wouldn't have broken up with Qin Chu like that all those years ago. Compared to GK, my family is not worth a dime.\" Wei Dong used the excuse promisingly.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Chu's name, Huo Mian felt a part of her heartache.</p><p>Qin Chu was the part of her past that she could not return to...</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I really like you with all my heart. Please give me a chance,\" Wei Dong begged again, with a sincere expression on his face.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":49,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:03.727","Link":"Chapter-49","NameDisplay":"Chapter 49"},{"ID":18112094842012087,"Name":"Chapter 50: Decision","NameUnsign":"Chapter 50: Decision","Description":"<p>Chapter 50: Decision</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Let me... think about this, and I'll get back to you.\" </p><p>\"Okay, I'll be waiting for you,\" said Wei Dong as he looked at Huo Mian with love. </p><p>After Huo Mian left the restaurant, she headed directly to the hospital. Her little brother didn't wake up yet, so she stayed in the VIP room to look after him. </p><p>Meanwhile, her mother's mental state had grown worse. She began acting more anxious, looking like she was about to explode at any moment. </p><p>Huo Mian, exhausted, sat on the bench outside the VIP room and dug her head deep into her arms. </p><p>\"Huo Mian.\" </p><p>\"Head Nurse,\" Huo Mian said with difficulty after she recognized who it was. </p><p>\"I heard what happened, I'll allow you to go on leave for the next few days.

We all want your brother to get better.\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, as tears emerged from the corners of her eyes. </p><p>She begged Ning Zhiyuan, but it was futile. She begged her classmates, but they all spoke of conditions. It might be too much to say that it was like pouring salt on the wound, but they sure were opportunistic. She couldn't be more grateful now that her colleagues had done this voluntarily. </p><p>The truth was, kindness between humans were mutual. Huo Mian had fully committed herself in the half-year since she began working in the OB/GYN department. She had done all kinds of dirty work, and often picked up her colleagues' unwanted shifts, so she was very well liked within the department. Even though the Head Nurse was very strict, she was still a very ethical and kind person.  </p><p>\"I have to run off now. Get yourself together, your brother still needs you.\" The head nurse turned to leave after she patted Huo Mian's shoulders. </p><p>Just then, a WeChat message suddenly popped up. </p><p>Huo Mian took her phone, looked at it, and saw that it was from Zhu Lingling. </p><p>\"I heard that you've asked Wei Dong for money?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"Don't ask him for money. Don't you know what he wants from you? You're walking into his trap.\" </p><p>\"Shouldn't you say that Wei Dong walked into my trap instead?\" </p><p>\"Don't be silly, what are you talking about? I'm not kidding. He would never lend money to you for no reason,\" Zhu Lingling replied angrily. </p><p>\"Yes, he does have conditions. He wants to be engaged to me, and get married within a month.\" </p><p>\"Well, what do you think?\" </p><p>\"I want to agree.\" </p><p>\"Are you crazy? You want to marry a guy like him? Don't you know what kind of person he is?\" Zhu Lingling was now very agitated. </p><p>\"Lingling, I have to marry someone anyway, and if I can't marry someone I love, why would anything else matter?\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling grew silent on the other side. </p><p>After a few moments, Zhu Lingling finally replied carefully, \"Mian, have you ever thought about asking Qin Chu for help? Maybe he could help you.\" </p><p>\"I would rather marry Wei Dong than beg Qin Chu.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling didn't say anything else after she saw how determined Huo Mian was. </p><p>After Wei Dong left, he became incredibly happy. He knew that Huo Mian needed money immediately, and it was only a matter of time before she agreed to his terms. </p><p>Therefore he told the class leader, Han Xu about this in an attempt to show off.  </p><p>This piece of gossip quickly spread around to their other classmates, as one told another and so on. </p><p>Qin Chu was in a business meeting when a friend request suddenly appeared from his WeChat app. </p><p>It was his high school classmate, Liu Siying.

The side of his mouth twitched in disgust as he said, \"You sure are courting death.\" </p><p>Wei Dong really did have it coming. </p><p>He clearly knew that Qin Chu loved Huo Mian, but regardless, he still chased after her. He clearly asked for it. </p><p>Of course, Wei Dong really thought that Qin Chu's feelings for Huo Mian had been left in the past.</p><p>After all, no one had heard any gossip concerning Qin Chu and Huo Mian after Qin Chu had returned to the country. </p><p>Aside from Zhu Lingling, none of their other classmates knew what was going on between the two of them.</p><p>- At Triumph Steel Works Corporation -</p><p>Wei Dong's father, Wei Changfu, was overwhelmed.

If you are his high school classmate, then you should be able to reach him yourself. I suggest that you call our president directly.\" </p><p>Wei Dong wanted to break in, but GK had extremely tight security; if he couldn't even get through to the first floor, how in the world would he be able to get to the top level, 56 floors from where he was?</p><p>As Qin Chu headed home in his humble Audi R8, Wei Dong blocked him at the gates of the parking lot.</p><p>If Qin Chu hadn't stepped on his brakes in time, he would've run him over. </p><p>Qin Chu stopped the car with a bad complexion on his face and slowly lowered the car window. </p><p>\"Get out of the car, Qin Chu. Let's talk,\" Wei Dong spat out aggressively. </p><p>\"I don't think there's anything we can talk about,\" Qin Chu remained full of pride. </p><p>The truth was that amongst all of his high school classmates, he didn't care much about anyone other than Huo Mian. </p><p>He was certainly not about to give Wei Dong a chance… </p><p>\"Why did you attack my company? What did I do to you? Why are you pushing us to our deaths?\" Wei Dong's face was filled with anger. </p><p>Qin Chu raised his head, his face cold and emotionless, \"I'll forcefully acquire your company at a low price within a week, which will force you and your dad into a debt of hundreds of millions of yuan. By then you won't have any other choice but to commit suicide. Now that's what I would call being pushed to death.\" </p><p>Wei Dong's face grew pale after he heard this. </p><p>If someone else had said this, he might only laugh and call that person out for boasting. </p><p>However, it was Qin Chu who said it. He truly would be doomed, given Qin Chu's status and position. </p><p>Qin Chu was the heir of GK, which is one of the top businesses in the country, maybe even one of the top 50 in Asia. </p><p>He was capable of destroying a tiny company like theirs in a matter of seconds. </p><p>\"Qin Chu, why are you doing this? After all, we were classmates. Do you… do you still like Huo Mian? Are you afraid that I will steal her from you?\" Wei Dong wasn't brainless.</p><p>\"Steal her from me? You really think highly of yourself, don't you?

Let's get married.

I don't even have the face to see you anymore.\" After he spoke, Wei Dong hurriedly hung up the phone without giving Huo Mian another chance to respond. </p><p>Huo Mian's world crumbled. It took her everything to get that 300,000 yuan, and now, all her efforts resulted in nothing. </p><p>She really wanted to cry… </p><p>However, Zhixing was still waiting for her inside the VIP Operating Room.</p><p>Finally, she decided that she could seek help from the media. She didn't care if anyone laughed at her, because she had to save Zhixing's life more than anything else. </p><p>Just as she took out her phone to search for the media's contact information, she received a call from the hospital. </p><p>\"You have to come now, your brother is in grave condition.\" </p><p>\"Okay, I'll be there immediately.\" </p><p>- Half an hour later, outside the First Hospital's VIP room - </p><p>\"The situation is extremely dire, and the patient can't afford to waste any more time. I suggest that we conduct the surgery now, but I'm not too confident about it. Huo Mian, the director said you know Dr. Qin? I would suggest that you ask him to perform the surgery. It's better if he does it. Plus, you wouldn't want to see any post-surgical side effects, right? This really is a matter of life and death. What do you say?\" </p><p>\"Let me think about it.\" </p><p>\"There's no time to think. The patient's cerebral hemorrhage is still ongoing. If we waste any more time, he will go brain dead.\" </p><p>\"Okay, wait for me, I'll be back.\" </p><p>In the end, her love for Zhixing defeated all else. She no longer cared if Qin Chu mocked her, or if he made her feel uncomfortable. </p><p>No matter what, she had to give it a shot… for her most beloved little brother. </p><p>- GK Headquarters - </p><p>\"Mr. Qin, there's a lady outside to see you. Her family name is Huo,\" the front desk called. </p><p>\"Let her in.\" Huo Mian was the only one Qin Chu knew with the last name \"Huo\" that would visit him at this time.</p><p>- Five minutes later - </p><p>Huo Mian knocked on the door to Qin Chu's office. </p><p>\"Come in.\" </p><p>Huo Mian pushed the door open and walked in. Qin Chu stood before the window, his eyes filled with immense tenderness as he turned around. </p><p>Huo Mian was probably the only one who had ever witnessed such a soft look from Qin Chu. </p><p>\"You've come?\" </p><p>\"I need to talk to you. It's an emergency.\" </p><p>\"Tell me.\" </p><p>After a brief moment of hesitation, Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu as she slowly opened her mouth, \"My little brother was in an accident and is receiving emergency care at the hospital. He's suffering from cerebral hemorrhage, and the surgery to fix it is extremely difficult. A second surgery is needed, and none of the doctors in the hospital are confident enough to perform it. The director spoke with me, and he recommended that you be the main attending for this surgery, and…\" Her voice began trailing off. </p><p>\"Keep going.\" Qin Chu looked at her as she spoke. </p><p>\"And… the surgery costs 300,000 yuan. Even if you perform the surgery, I still have to pay for the medical supplies and equipment. I don't have the money, so could you please lend me some?\" </p><p>Huo Mian bit on her lips, and she delivered these two requests with great difficulty... </p><p>She thought Qin Chu would mock her and make fun of her, or even force her to beg him. </p><p>After all, she was the one who abandoned him seven years ago and declared that they were only classmates on graduation day in front of the entire school. This broke Qin Chu's heart, and that was why he left the country. </p><p>She thought that he would now use this chance to take revenge on her. </p><p>However, upon hearing everything, Qin Chu only said, \"Sure, that's fine.\" </p><p>\"Really?\" Huo Mian found it somewhat hard to believe. </p><p>In fact, Qin Chu already knew what was happening with Huo Mian's brother. Huo Mian didn't know that Qin Chu had been watching Huo Mian's every move, and after Liu Siying sent him that WeChat message, he looked into Huo Mian and Wei Dong's contact history. That was why he issued the death warrant on Triumph Steel Works. Therefore, Qin Chu wasn't shocked when Huo Mian told him of the situation. Instead, he thought of it as an opportunity.</p><p>\"I could personally perform your brother's surgery, and give you 300,000 yuan, but…\" Qin Chu stopped abruptly. </p><p>Huo Mian grew slightly disappointed. She knew that he had terms and wouldn't help her for no reason. </p><p>\"Marry me.\" </p><p>\"What?\" Huo Mian was shocked. </p><p>Did he really mention marriage at a critical time like this?</p><p>\"Marry me and I'll help you.

Let's get married when we pass by the Civil Administration Bureau.\" </p><p>\"Today?\" Huo Mian was surprised. </p><p>\"Yes, when else were you thinking?\" Qin Chu looked at her with a serious expression. </p><p>Huo Mian was shocked; she didn't think that today was a good day to get married. </p><p>\"Are you worried that I'll back down on the deal? Do you not trust me?\" Huo Mian said as she smiled bitterly. </p><p>She thought that Qin Chu didn't trust her and suspected that she wouldn't marry him after the surgery. </p><p>However, she had no clue that it was just because Qin Chu had waited far too long for this day. </p><p>\"No, I just thought that today would be a great day. Come, we still need to get to the hospital for the surgery.\" </p><p>After he spoke, Qin Chu took his jacket and walked out of the office. Huo Mian silently followed behind him. </p><p>The secretaries outside of the office were all astounded at this sight. </p><p>\"Who is she? I thought that the president forbade people from entering his office. Why did he let her in?\" </p><p>\"I don't know. She doesn't look like the president's girlfriend. She's not that pretty, and she's in very simple clothes. Do you think she might be the new housemaid his family hired?\"</p><p>\"Are you stupid? Would our president personally interview a housemaid? Let's go ask Assistant Yang.\" </p><p>After the secretaries began gossiping, someone grew brave enough to go and ask Assistant Yang. </p><p>\"Assistant Yang, who was that woman? The President seemed to treat her differently.\" </p><p>\"How would I know? It's my first time seeing her as well,\" Assistant Yang said with an innocent look.</p><p>\"Doesn't marriage registration require a household register? I don't have mine with me,\" Huo Mian said quietly from the passenger seat. </p><p>\"No.\" </p><p>\"Huh?\" Once again, Huo Mian was shocked. She never knew they could register for marriage without a household register.</p><p>The truth was, Qin Chu was just so powerful and resourceful that he could even go and get married butt naked if he wanted to.</p><p>- At the Civil Administration Bureau - </p><p>Inside the VIP reception room, a staff member passed the couple two little red books, which were their marriage certificates.</p><p>\"That's it? We're married?\" Huo Mian asked anxiously. </p><p>\"Yes, we found your household register in our system. Congratulations on your marriage.\" </p><p>\"Let's go.\" In a good mood, Qin Chu quickly took one of the red books.</p><p>Huo Mian followed behind him, still in disbelief. They got married without any identification.</p><p>But the truth was, Qin Chu called the senior official's assistant, that middle-aged man, while he went to pick up his car from the parking lot. </p><p>He firmly asked for this as his reward. </p><p>The middle-aged man was very efficient, and the Civil Administration Bureau treated this with great care. </p><p>- Inside some teahouse in Jing City - </p><p>\"Sir, we've completed your orders.\" </p><p>\"This kid sure is interesting. Quite a reward he asked for,\" said a kind old man with white hair, and wrinkle lines on his face. </p><p>\"I mean, only these so-called geniuses could think of such things. They always manage to surprise others,\" the middle-aged man agreed. </p><p>\"Qin Chu, we should head to the hospital now,\" Huo Mian rushed. </p><p>\"From now on, I'm your husband.\" Without waiting for Huo Mian to respond, Qin Chu suddenly held up her face and pressed his lips against hers. Then he accelerated and drove away at a high speed.</p><p>Huo Mian sat beside him in a daze...</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":54,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:06.817","Link":"Chapter-54","NameDisplay":"Chapter 54"},{"ID":18112094872915926,"Name":"Chapter 55: Trust","NameUnsign":"Chapter 55: Trust","Description":"<p>Chapter 55: Trust</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>- First People's Hospital of C City -</p><p>Qin Chu's decision to personally operate on Jing Zhixin rattled the hospital director. He immediately ordered for the preparation of the VIP Operation Room.</p><p>It wasn't until Qin Chu had on a white surgical gown and was reading over the medical files with such focus did Huo Mian realize how incredibly charming the man was.</p><p>She couldn't believe that the sight in front of her was real...</p><p>She never thought that one day, she would be able to see him stand in the operating room as a doctor, with the lights illuminating his handsome face. The familiar figure, the man who she was once deeply in love with, was there in front of her. It felt unreal.</p><p>She made her way to Qin Chu slowly and quietly, but he noticed her movements.</p><p>As soon as he saw Huo Mian, his gaze softened...</p><p>\"I want to help you.\"</p><p>\"No, it's fine. You can wait for us outside.\"</p><p>\"Let me help, I want to be in there. I was present for that important surgery, so it won't be a problem this time.

I'm afraid you'll be distracted.\"</p><p>\"But...\" Huo Mian seemed unwilling to give in and wanted to say more.</p><p>\"Do you trust me?\" asked Qin Chu.</p><p>Huo Mian was taken back...</p><p>\"If you trust me, let me take care of it.\"</p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Huo Mian nodded her head slightly...</p><p>\"Dr. Qin, we can begin the surgery. Everything is ready,\" the assistant surgeon opened the door and announced.</p><p>Qin Chu picked up the surgical mask. He put it on slowly and turned to enter the OR.</p><p>At that moment, Huo Mian swore that she had never seen a more attractive man...</p><p>Huo Mian waited outside the surgery room, feeling anxious. Half an hour went by without any news.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps echoed throughout the hallway. Huo Mian raised her head, looking slightly surprised at the person walking towards her.</p><p>\"Director, you're here.\"</p><p>\"Yes, how is it going in there?\"</p><p>\"I don't know yet.\" Huo Mian looked worried.</p><p>\"No need to worry, I trust Dr. Qin's surgical skills.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded...</p><p>Then, the hospital director said meaningfully, \"You're probably the only person who can persuade him into coming here.\"</p><p>Huo Mian felt slightly embarrassed. She didn't want to flaunt her relationship with Qin Chu, nor did she want to tell others about it.</p><p>\"I really want to hire him to be a doctor here, but unfortunately... how could I match up to the pay a president receives from GK? I am curious about one thing, however, and as his friend, maybe you know something about it.\"</p><p>\"What is it?\" Huo Mian asked quietly.</p><p>\"Dr. Qin was born into a wealthy family, and he's the rightful successor of GK. Why did he go abroad for seven years to study at Harvard Medical School? I think… it's quite strange.\"</p><p>Huo Mian bit down on her lips, responding after a while, \"Actually, I don't really know either.\"</p><p>Hearing her answer, the hospital director looked slightly disappointed...</p><p>\"Anyways, don't worry too much. I'm sure that the surgery will be successful.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Director.\" Huo Mian nodded in gratitude.</p><p>The hospital director turned to leave but quickly turned back as he had forgotten to say something. \"An hour ago, the hospital received payments for the surgery from GK's finance department. It was a total of 500,000 yuan. 300,000 for the operation and the remaining 200,000 is probably for follow-ups.\"</p><p>\"Rea...lly?\" Huo Mian was surprised. Not only did Qin Chu deliver the money to her so quickly, he even gave her an additional 200,000 yuan for follow-up fees. He really was thoughtful.</p><p>Before the hospital director left, he gave Huo Mian a meaningful look and said, \"Huo Mian, you are a lucky girl.\"</p><p>Then, the hospital director turned around and left...</p><p>Huo Mian stood there, dazed. She had also thought that she was the luckiest girl for meeting Qin Chu.</p><p>But, the incident with Uncle Jing led to their breakup. She was incredibly miserable afterward, wishing from then on that she had never met Qin Chu.</p><p>If only she didn't attend 2nd High School...</p><p>Now that such a long time had passed by, she realized there was truth to the hospital director's words.</p><p>During her time of need, with so many people around, it was still Qin Chu who truly came to her rescue.</p><p>It seemed like his presence could always calm her heart.</p><p>As she was lost in her thoughts, Huo Mian's phone suddenly rang.</p><p>\"Why are you calling me?\" Huo Mian asked with a hint of vigilance as she picked up the phone.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":55,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:07.293","Link":"Chapter-55","NameDisplay":"Chapter 55"},{"ID":1811209487814005,"Name":"Chapter 56: Taking Initiative","NameUnsign":"Chapter 56: Taking Initiative","Description":"<p>Chapter 56: Taking Initiative</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I heard that your little brother was in a car accident,\" a man's voice spoke through the phone.</p><p>Although that number wasn't saved on her phone, the '9999' ending was enough for her to identify him.</p><p>The man was none other than Huo Siqian, the eldest son of the Huo Family and the vice president of the Huo Corporation.</p><p>\"Yes.

I'm very busy, goodbye.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I can lend you money,\" Huo Siqian suddenly said just as she was about to hang up the phone</p><p>His words surprised Huo Mian.</p><p>\"What? You want to lend me money?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I heard that the driver fled the scene. The police are still investigating, and you haven't received any compensation. Your little brother is staying in the First People's Hospital, which means you'll need a lot of money for his treatment. I know that you don't have any friends who can lend you an amount that big, including that fiancé of yours. So I thought I would lend you the money. You can pay me back slowly, without interest.\"</p><p>\"Why are you being so nice to me?\" Huo Mian scoffed. There was no such thing as a free lunch, and she had learned the meaning of that a long time ago.</p><p>Huo Siqian was a businessman, not a philanthropist. He wouldn't help someone out without some kind of catch. She was really curious, however, as to why he wanted to help her.</p><p>\"Because you're my little sister,\" Huo Siqian laughed.</p><p>\"I don't recall having a powerful older brother like you. I've said this before and I'll say it again, stop calling me your younger sister. If you're after something, don't even think about it. I have no shares in the Huo Family, and the old man's not giving me an inheritance. If the past is any indication, then he wouldn't care even if I died out on the street. So really, I have nothing to offer you, Mr. Huo.\"</p><p>\"You think too lowly of me. What could I be after? I just want to help you out.\"</p><p>\"Oh? Then thank you, but I really don't need it. My little brother's... fees for the operation have already been paid.\"</p><p>\"Paid? Who helped you out with that much money?\" Huo Siqian was clearly surprised.</p><p>\"That's none of your business. Plus, I don't think we're close enough to discuss such personal matters. Please stop calling me in the future, I'm a busy person.\" Then, Huo Mian immediately hung up the phone.</p><p>Huo Siqian gave her a weird feeling. She always thought that he was a very strange man...</p><p>Although he was the only member of the Huo Family who was nice to her, for some reason, she still didn't like him.</p><p>After Uncle Jing's incident, she gave up on the chance to study abroad and attended a third-rate domestic university.</p><p>Huo Siqian offered to send her to England many times, but she had always rejected him.</p><p>She truly wanted to cut ties with the Huo Family.

Given GK's involvement in multiple industries, the company was very busy, 366 days a year, eight days a week, 25 hours a day.</p><p>Although Qin Chu's father, Qin Yumin, was the chairman of the board, his heart was in poor condition, and he was suffering from high blood pressure. As a result, he was already entering retirement. Other than high-stake, billion-yuan projects, he left everything in the care of Qin Chu.</p><p>Although Qin Chu disliked his status as GK's president, he had made a promise to his father many years ago, and he was going to do his best.</p><p>With such a massive workload, a sleepless night, and an ensuing surgery, it was natural for him to feel utterly exhausted.</p><p>Perhaps the most important reason was that he hadn't eaten the entire day.</p><p>His stomach already began to protest...</p><p>Brain surgeries are incredibly demanding as they required the complete focus from the surgeon. One wrong move and the patient may lose their life or suffer long-lasting after effects.</p><p>Plus, the patient was Huo Mian's little brother. Qin Chu was obviously trying his hardest...</p><p>\"Here, have some water. You don't look well.\" Huo Mian filled a disposable cup with warm water and handed it over to him.</p><p>Qin Chu lifted his head and looked at Huo Mian, remaining silent as he took the cup of water.</p><p>\"Thank you for today. Really.\" Huo Mian expressed her gratitude sincerely.</p><p>Holding the cup of hot water, Qin Chu replied slowly, \"We're married. You don't have to be so polite.\"</p><p>\"...\" Huo Mian was momentarily speechless. If he didn't remind her, she would've forgotten that today was the day they received their marriage certificate.</p><p>\"Qin Chu.\"</p><p>\"Hm?\"</p><p>\"Could you please not tell anyone about our marriage...\"</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"We're not from the same world, you...?\"</p><p>\"So what you're saying is, my status as GK's president will embarrass you?\" Qin Chu put down the untouched water, his tone cold.</p><p>\"No, it's not that. I just don't want it to get onto the media. My mother will see, and she has deep misunderstandings towards you.\"</p><p>\"So we have to hide our marriage our entire life?\" Qin Chu was evidently unwilling to do that. Who would want to hide the fact that they're married? In fact, he couldn't wait to tell the world that he and Huo Mian were husband and wife.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":57,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:08.327","Link":"Chapter-57","NameDisplay":"Chapter 57"},{"ID":18112094888946974,"Name":"Chapter 58: Compensation","NameUnsign":"Chapter 58: Compensation","Description":"<p>Chapter 58: Compensation</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head. \"No, I just wanted to give my mom more time. After all, her health isn't so good, and I'm afraid she can't handle it.\"</p><p>Qin Chu gazed at Huo Mian's eyes for a long time, ultimately losing to their sincerity.</p><p>\"Alright then, we'll do things your way.\"</p><p>Then, Qin Chu got up to leave...</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"Back to the company.\" As he spoke, Qin Chu took off his scrub suit and began to head out.</p><p>\"Why don't you leave after you eat something? There's an employee cafeteria downstairs.\" Huo Mian immediately regretted her words. How could someone like Qin Chu eat at an employee cafeteria?</p><p>\"No, I'm fine.\"</p><p>Sure enough, he declined...</p><p>Just as he reached the door, Qin Chu turned around as if he suddenly remembered something. He took the warm cup of water and drank it all in.</p><p>\"Tastes pretty good.\" Once again, Qin Chu turned around to leave...</p><p>Huo Mian stood there dumbfounded. Just how good-tasting could a cup of water be?</p><p>When Qin Chu returned to GK, he was greeted by a freaked out Assistant Yang.</p><p>The president had disappeared for five hours. With his cell phone turned off, no affair, big or small, could be discussed with him.</p><p>This led him to request instructions from the chairman of the board. As a result, the chairman overreacted and ordered everyone to look for the president.</p><p>They were even about to call the police...</p><p>\"Mr. Qin, you're finally back.\" Assistant Yang looked miserable.</p><p>\"What happened?\"</p><p>\"An important document required your signature but your phone was off. I ultimately called the chairman, and he handled the situation. But…\"</p><p>\"Keep going.\"</p><p>\"But the chairman was worried about your safety. Many people from the corporation were out looking for your car throughout the entire city. They thought that you were in an accident. Mr. Qin, where did you go?\"</p><p>\"Do I need to tell you my whereabouts?\" Qin Chu glanced at Assistant Yang coldly.</p><p>\"No no, that's not what I meant. I'm just worried about your safety. Plus, there are too many things to take care of at the corporation. I can't handle everything if you disappear for five hours.\"</p><p>\"If being an assistant at GK was so easy, would I pay you 30,000 a month?\" Qin Chu asked.</p><p>Assistant Yang was immediately speechless...</p><p>But there was merit to his words. Wasn't it the assistant's responsibility to handle miscellaneous tasks for the president?</p><p>\"Mr. Qin, these documents require your signature. Please look them over.\"</p><p>\"Fine.\" Qin Chu nodded, looking tired.</p><p>\"Mr. Qin, you don't look well.\"</p><p>\"Pour me a glass of water,\" Qin Chu instructed.</p><p>\"Of course.\"</p><p>Assistant Yang placed a cup of warm water on the desk cautiously...</p><p>Looking at the tall pile of files, Qin Chu took a sip of water from the glass.</p><p>His brows furrowed...</p><p>\"What's wrong Mr. Qin? Is the water too cold?\"</p><p>\"Why is it so tasteless?\" raising his head, Qin Chu asked in a serious tone.</p><p>His question startled Assistant Yang, causing him to stammer out an explanation. \"It's not coffee or tea. It's just plain water. Isn't it supposed to be tasteless?\"</p><p>\"But the one I just drank tasted great.\"</p><p>\"Um...Mr. Qin, where did you drink the water? I could check out that brand later?\"</p><p>Qin Chu fell into silence, burying his head into work once again.</p><p>Jing Zhixin remained in excellent condition after his surgery. Huo Mian delivered the good news to her mother. Although the woman was still sad, the update gave her a reason to relax.</p><p>Afterward, Huo Mian went to report to the head nurse at the OB/GYN Department but was stopped by an unfamiliar middle-aged woman.</p><p>\"Are you Jing Zhixin's older sister?\"</p><p>\"You are?\"</p><p>\"I'm the mother of one of the car crash victims. My son's also heavily injured; he broke a leg.\"</p><p>\"Do you need anything from me?\" Huo Mian asked, looking at the unfamiliar face.</p><p>\"Are you satisfied with their compensation?

Other than the girl who died, your younger brother suffered the most injuries so you will probably receive even more compensation than us.\" As the woman spoke, Huo Mian almost saw a glimpse of envy from her eyes.</p><p>\"This car accident was malicious. I've collected information from various sources, and it seems that the perpetrator was driving drunk and speeding on the school campus. This is truly terrible behavior. It's not resolvable through compensations or an apology; he's criminally responsible. In a few days, after I gather all the evidence, I will sue them. I don't want any compensation, just justice.\" With that, Huo Mian turned on her heel and left.</p><p>\"Is this girl an idiot?\" the middle-aged woman mumbled to herself.</p><p>Was Huo Mian foolish? Of course not. She was simply refusing to trade her brother's health for some meaningless compensation.</p><p>What she wanted was for the immoral perpetrator to be brought to justice...</p><p>Speeding on the school campus, killing one and injuring three. Not only was he irresponsible, he fled the scene of the crash. How could he stoop so low?!</p><p>Apparently the girl who died was sitting on the passenger seat of the car, and they were even dating.</p><p>With his girlfriend dead, the low life went into hiding, delegating all the difficult conversations with the victims' families to his attorney.</p><p>Huo Mian made up her mind. It was lucky that Zhixin was alright. If he suffered from side effects, she would give up everything to fight those people.</p><p>Sure enough, just as Huo Mian was about to leave work, she received a phone call from the perpetrator's attorney, asking for a private meeting.</p><p>After Huo Mian agreed, she went straight to their meeting spot, a cafe near the hospital.</p><p>The other party was an attorney in his forties. His face was square, and he had on a pair of glasses. He was wearing a black suit and carrying a black briefcase.</p><p>\"Are you Miss Huo?\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded...</p><p>\"Nice to meet you. My name is Luo Qing and I am Mr. Lu Yigang's attorney. The goal of this meeting is simple. The Lu Family wants to settle the matter privately without causing a scene or going through the legal process. I heard that Miss Huo's younger brother is currently receiving treatment for his serious injuries. From what I understand, his recovery will require substantial costs. My suggestion for you is to put forward a reasonable number, which my client will then pay. This will be good for everyone, don't you agree?\"</p><p>\"So if I say a random number, they will fulfill the amount?\" Huo Mian scoffed.</p><p>\"Of course not. But as long as the number is reasonable, my client will agree to pay.\" Luo Qing appeared to be completely confident.</p><p>\"What do you consider reasonable? Could you please explain that to me? I don't quite understand.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>Seeing that he had piqued Huo Mian's interest, Luo Qing immediately took out a thick pile of documents from his briefcase. He then said to her, \"I've done a little bit of research regarding your family situation, Miss Huo. Your family is not very wealthy, so I believe that you will need this money. Of course, we will provide you with a decent amount. Other than the surgical fees, we will also compensate your family for psychological damages. The surgery fees are about 300,000, and the follow-up fees are 70,000 to 80,000. In addition to this, we will offer another 300,000, totaling up to 700,000 yuan. Miss Huo, are you satisfied with this number?\"</p><p>\"700,000 yuan.

I will then ask my client to transfer the money to your account.\"</p><p>\"But can 700,000 yuan buy my brother's health? His brain was almost injured beyond healing, which would've left him permanently disabled,\" Huo Mian questioned coldly, her eyes glaring.</p><p>Sensing a change in her tone, Mr. Luo was taken aback. He corrected his glasses and said, \"We're very sorry about the incident. My client was drunk at the time, and it wasn't his intention to cause harm. He is very apologetic towards the whole situation.\"</p><p>\"I don't think that's the case. Not only did he flee the scene, but he also has yet to show his face since the incident. If the consequences weren't so severe, he probably wouldn't have even taken responsibility.\"</p><p>\"That's not true. My client was just too frightened after the incident occurred. He's just a university student. The girl who died in the car accident was his girlfriend, and he is very distressed about her death. That is why his parents entrusted me, as his attorney, to help him handle the situation. Miss Huo, since we're both straightforward people, I'll be honest with you. The other two victims each received compensation of 500,000 yuan. One of them even has a broken leg. I heard that your brother's surgery was very successful and he is out of the woods. I can offer an additional 100,000 yuan, making the total 800,000 yuan. You will receive a lot more than the other two. Is that good enough?\"</p><p>\"800,000… haha. If I give you 800,000 yuan, does that mean I can hit you with a car and injure you as your client did to my brother?\"</p><p>Mr. Luo's expression darkened, \"Miss Huo, we are very sincere with our offer. The accident already happened, and it is something we must face. We only paid 850,000 to the family of the girl who died. Compared to them, paying 800,000 to you is already a lot. Plus, we will transfer the money instantly, without a single day of waiting. Don't you need the money?\"</p><p>\"As opposed to receiving money, I'm more concerned about seeking justice for my little brother.\"</p><p>\"So what you're saying is...\"</p><p>\"I won't accept a private settlement. I will bring him to court. According to present-day traffic laws, your client caused a fatal car crash. Not only was he driving under the influence, but he also fled the scene of the crime. I trust that the judge will rule in favor of justice.\"</p><p>Mr. Luo couldn't help but laugh at her words.</p><p>\"What's so funny?\" His attitude annoyed Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Miss Huo, I'm laughing at your innocence. I can't believe girls like you still exist.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"Miss Huo, you're probably unfamiliar with my client's background. Sure, my client, Lu Yigang, is only a 21-year-old university student, but do you know who his parents are?\"</p><p>Huo Mian remained silent, waiting for him to continue...</p><p>\"I don't mind telling you. His parents are both government officials in the Ministry of Finance. On top of that, his relatives are also government officials. Basically, he has the world in his palms. With such a powerful background, do you really think that you will win against him in court? I advise that you take the money and move on. Even the family who lost their daughter weren't so sanctimonious. Don't try to be Lady Justice. Let me tell you: there is no true justice in this world. With money and power, you're God. Without it, you're nothing. I know these words hurt, but it's the truth.\"</p><p>\"He has a powerful background? Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh~ 1  , I'm so scared.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"It's true that he has a powerful background,\" she continued immediately. \"I can tell by the sluggish way the police are handling the situation. But so what? Regardless of his background, shouldn't he follow the law just like everyone else? I'm not his mom. Why should I forgive him? Taking him to court is a process I must undergo. They can use all their connections but... don't forget, there is a thing called the media. Once the news goes viral and he receives pressure from the public, I wonder how his powerful parents will protect him then?\"</p><p>Upon hearing her words, Mr. Luo began to sweat...</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":60,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:09.86","Link":"Chapter-60","NameDisplay":"Chapter 60"},{"ID":181120948103909766,"Name":"Chapter 61: Means","NameUnsign":"Chapter 61: Means","Description":"<p>Chapter 61: Means</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>He thought that Huo Mian was just a naive little girl, so her meticulous thinking clearly surprised him.</p><p>\"Miss Huo, tell me, what do we have to do to get you to stop?

So, offering me more money is useless right now, and therefore you cannot stop me from pressing charges. If you really want this to go away, why don't you let that drunk-driving bastard who caused a chain crash to enjoy a couple years in jail? How about you let him learn his lesson so that he'll never hurt another person again?\"</p><p>\"Is that a joke? Turning in my client is not an option.\"</p><p>\"Oh yeah? In that case, I'll see you in court, Mr. Luo.\" Huo Mian immediately got up to leave.</p><p>\"Miss Huo, is there really no other option?\" Luo Qing furthered his chase relentlessly.</p><p>This time, Huo Mian didn't even look back as she opened the door and left.</p><p>She couldn't imagine what that guy was thinking, speeding across campus in a Porsche, killing one and heavily injuring three, with the deceased being none other than his own girlfriend. In a situation like that, with his girlfriend dying, shouldn't calling 911 be his top priority? How could he run away and leave everyone else behind to die?! The girl died because they didn't get her to a hospital in time to receive treatment. Otherwise, she might have lived. How could Huo Mian easily forgive someone like that? This wasn't even taking into account that the accident almost paralyzed her younger brother!</p><p>No amount of money could outweigh his health...</p><p>- Midnight, in a garage -</p><p>\"So what you're saying is that she wouldn't settle? No matter how much money we offer her?\" a middle-aged man asked faintly.</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Lu. The girl is very stubborn. She's adamant about putting your son in jail.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense. How can a low life like her dictate my son's life?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Lu, you're right. So what should we do next?\" Luo Qing asked carefully.</p><p>\"We'll take care of the rest. Just make sure to get the signatures from the other three families.\"</p><p>Huo Mian returned to her apartment for a change of clothes and quickly left for the hospital once again. She was very worried about her mother.</p><p>\"Mom, Zhixin is fine now. He'll wake up tomorrow. Don't worry.\"</p><p>\"I need to ask you something. Where did you get the money to pay for Zhixin's surgical fees? The doctor said it was over a hundred thousand yuan.\"</p><p>\"I...I borrowed it from a friend.\"</p><p>\"Where did you get a friend who is rich enough to lend you an amount like that? Don't tell me you asked your bastard father. No, that's not it, he's not that nice. Did you do something inappropriate in exchange for money?\" Yang Meirong stared into her daughter's eyes and interrogated her.</p><p>\"Mom, I didn't.\" Huo Mian knew that her mother would condemn her to hell if she found out that she and Qin Chu got married.</p><p>\"Then answer me this. What's going on between you and Ning Zhiyuan? Are the two of you getting married or not?\" Yang Meirong questioned again.</p><p>Hearing that name left Huo Mian momentarily speechless. She didn't know what to say.</p><p>\"Why are you so quiet? Are you mute?\" Yang Meirong continued with her questioning.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Huo Mian said slowly, \"Mom, Ning Zhiyuan and I... we're done. We are no longer connected in any way…\"</p><p>\"Is it because of that kid from the Qin family?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Huo Mian immediately denied.</p><p>\"Don't say I haven't warned you. Don't you remember how Uncle Jing died? The Qin Family is our enemy. If you dare have any connection to them, I will tear you to shreds,\" Yang Meirong threatened, almost growling.</p><p>\"I know.\" Huo Mian's voice was lacking in conviction.

Did he have to remind her again that they were now husband and wife? </p><p>\"Because your Audi R8 draws too much attention. I don't want people saying things about me at the hospital. Besides… even our director's car isn't as fancy as yours.\" If Huo Mian remembered correctly, Mr. Bigwig Director's car was only an Audi A8. </p><p>If she were to really get into an Audi R8 right in front of the hospital, she would never hear the end of it. </p><p>On the other end, Qin Chu was silent. Huo Mian guessed that he might be upset. </p><p>\"I can just take the bus by myself,\" she added. </p><p>Clack! The call was ended from the other end.</p><p>This guy's temper was still exactly the same as seven years ago, proud and stuck-up. What a piece of work. </p><p>After completing her night shift, Huo Mian was exhausted. First thing in the morning, she went to file the paperwork for her mother's discharge. </p><p>Then, the two of them went to the VIP room together. Zhixin wasn't awake yet. However, according to Doctor Liu, all of his vital signs were stable. It was only a matter of time before he woke up. In the end, her mother stayed behind to take care of Zhixin. Huo Mian headed home, hoping to get some decent sleep. </p><p>After several days of running up and down the hospital nonstop, she felt like she was on the verge of collapsing. </p><p>When Huo Mian walked out of the hospital doors, a white Volkswagen CC stopped before her. </p><p>Just as she was wondering what was going on, the driver rolled down the window and spoke, \"Get in.\" </p><p>\"Um… Why are you here?\" </p><p>Huo Mian didn't think that Qin Chu would actually come, and to come driving such a low-key Volkswagen CC at that. </p><p>The cars waiting behind him kept on blaring their horns. This stuck-up driver had parked in front of the door, severely obstructing vehicular movement. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't dare stay there any longer, and quickly opened the car door to the passenger seat. </p><p>Only then did Qin Chu smugly start the car and drive away. </p><p>\"You… got a new car?\" she asked quietly. </p><p>\"It's my assistant's car, I borrowed it.\" Qin Chu's tone was nonchalant. </p><p>Heavens knew that he had called Yang first thing in the morning, telling him that he wanted to swap cars. </p><p>Only God knew how bewildered Yang felt. He really didn't know if he could handle driving his boss's Audi R8 to work. </p><p>Besides, what was so great about his less-than-thirty-thousand-yuan CC that it caught his boss's attention? </p><p>After the brief exchange, Huo Mian didn't speak again. The two sat in awkward silence. </p><p>\"What do you want to eat?\" </p><p>\"Huh?\" Qin Chu's sudden question left Huo Mian momentarily stunned. </p><p>\"What do you want to eat?\" </p><p>\"It's okay. I'm not really hungry.\" </p><p>\"Chinese or Western?\" Qin Chu asked, ignoring Huo Mian's response. </p><p>After some hesitation, Huo Mian realized with reluctance that this guy was just as bossy as he had been back in the day. She could only compromise. </p><p>\"Chinese.\" </p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the car stopped before First Class Royal Palace. </p><p>Qin Chu led her inside, heading straight up to the private rooms on the second floor. </p><p>Then he ordered some shrimp dumplings, crab congee, and other dim sum dishes. </p><p>Huo Mian hadn't had such a lavish breakfast in a very long time. As she ate, she kept sneaking glances at Qin Chu. </p><p>She saw that, while he ate with immaculate table manners, he was scrolling on his cell phone with his other hand, checking on the day's stock market. </p><p>After she finished, Huo Mian set down her spoon. \"I'm done,\" she said slowly. </p><p>\"Okay, then get your card and pay the bill,\" Qin Chu said nonchalantly. </p><p>\"What? Why am I paying the bill?\" Huo Mian was about to explode. She didn't think Qin Chu was this stingy. Besides, at a place like First Class Royal Palace, breakfast had to have cost at least a thousand yuan. </p><p>Like she had that kind of cash on her.

This information had come too suddenly for her to absorb fully. </p><p>\"Waiter, bill please,\" Qin Chu said. </p><p>\"Yes sir, your total comes up to 1080 yuan.\" </p><p>\"She'll pay,\" Qin Chu said lazily, pointing at Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian pulled out the only ICBC debit card from her purse. If she remembered correctly, there was less than 800 yuan left on that card. She didn't know how much Qin Chu had transferred her. He wasn't toying with her, was he? </p><p>After swiping the card, the waiter carefully returned it to her. Then, the two of them walked out of the restaurant together. </p><p>Huo Mian was still mulling over a question that she was too embarrassed to ask out loud. </p><p>\"You want to ask me how much my monthly salary is, don't you?\" seeing her hesitation, Qin Chu asked the question for her. </p><p>Huo Mian immediately nodded. </p><p>The adorable gesture she made had Qin Chu lifting the corners of his lips ever so slightly. </p><p>\"Why don't you check on your banking app later?\" </p><p>\"…\" </p><p>What kind of stinking response was that? Was he messing around with her? </p><p>Just then, Qin Chu's cell phone rang. </p><p>\"Alright, I got it. But I have important business to attend to right now. Tell them to delay the meeting another thirty minutes.\" </p><p>When he finished, Qin Chu hung up the phone. </p><p>\"Since you have important business, let's part here. I can take the bus home.\" </p><p>Qin Chu glanced at Huo Mian, his eyes cold. \"The important business I was talking about is taking you home,\" he said. </p><p>Qin Chu's expression was clearly saying that she was an idiot. </p><p>Sometimes, he really wondered if Huo Mian, once touted as a genius with an IQ of 130, was actually one of those weirdos with a high IQ but low EQ. </p><p>Having heard what Qin Chu said, Huo Mian's expression clearly lagged for an instant. </p><p>Then, a warm feeling welled up in her chest. </p><p>\"Let's go, get in the car.\" </p><p>Twenty minutes later, Qin Chu dropped Huo Mian off at her apartment building. </p><p>\"Alright, I'm home. Thank you for the ride.\" </p><p>She was still not used to Qin Chu treating her so well. After all, they had already been apart for more than seven years. </p><p>She needed some time before she could get accustomed to this suddenly intimate relationship. </p><p>\"When I get off work, I'll come to get you.\" </p><p>\"You don't need to.\" </p><p>\"Terminate the lease for this apartment. You're moving in with me.\" Qin Chu's tone was commanding. </p><p>\"No,\" Huo Mian instantly rejected him. </p><p>Qin Chu stared at her with a complicated expression on his face,\"We're husband and wife. We're not separating right after marriage, are we? Unless you think that, after all that I've helped you with, you can just leave me out to dry for half a year, and then bring up divorce. Are you going back on your word, now that you no longer need me?\" </p><p>\"That's not what I meant,\" Huo Mian objected. </p><p>\"Then it's settled. I'll come and get you tonight. You don't need to bring anything; I have everything ready at my place.\" Without waiting for Huo Mian's reply, Qin Chu turned around and left. </p><p>Staring at his tall, broad back as he walked away, Huo Mian let out a light sigh. </p><p>It's been seven years. His bossiness and stuck-up attitude hadn't changed a bit. If anything, it had gotten worse. </p><p>However, moving in with him... was that really okay? Wasn't he living with his parents? </p><p>She had already met the Qin couple many years ago. They borderline hated her. </p><p>She didn't like them, either. After Uncle Jing's death, she had began viewing Qin Chu's parents as Uncle Jing's murderers. </p><p>Huo Mian couldn't imagine what it would be like to live under the same roof as the people she held a grudge against. </p><p>Qin Chu arrived at his office five minutes before the meeting was set to begin. </p><p>He walked straight into the conference room. Picking up the documents his assistant had handed him, he flipped through the pages, then listened to the executives from each of the departments make their reports. </p><p>An hour later, the meeting ended. Qin Chu didn't say a word, from beginning to end. </p><p>\"Mr. Qin, the meeting is pretty much wrapped up. Is there anything you'd like to add?\" Yang asked cautiously. </p><p>Qin Chu slowly closed the file he was holding, and then scanned the room. </p><p>One after the other, the executives lowered their heads, not daring to meet their boss's gaze for fear of making a mistake. </p><p>\"Inform the Finance Department to double all corporate employees' pay for this month.\" </p><p>\"Mr. Qin, this…\" The good news came so suddenly that Yang was at a loss for words.</p><p>The other executives all wore dumbfounded expressions as well.

With his hand against his forehead, he said thoughtfully, \"Good project? Yeah, it's a project that's been on my mind for years now. It's finally settled.\" </p><p>\"That's fantastic. Can you tell us what this project is? We'd like to share in your joy!\" The Deputy Director continued to flatter. </p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Chu slowly rose to his feet. Smoothing out his collar, he said calmly, \"You don't need to know. In any case, today is a good day.\" </p><p>With that, Qin Chu turned around and left. </p><p>Behind him was a room full of bewildered executives. </p><p>Yang quietly counted his fingers. The corporate headquarters held two thousand employees in total, with a combined monthly salary of eight million yuan. With his statement today, the president had issued another eight million in spending. Rich people sure can do whatever comes to their mind, he thought.</p><p>Their boss, in particular, was exceptionally so. </p><p>\"Uh… Mr. Qin.\" Assistant Yang jogged up to Qin Chu. </p><p>\"What?\" </p><p>\"There's something I've been meaning to say.\" </p><p>\"Say it.\" </p><p>\"But I'm afraid it might make you mad.\" </p><p>\"Then don't say it.\" Qin Chu's reply nearly sent Yang straight into tears. </p><p>\"No, no. I really need to talk to you about this.\" </p><p>\"Say it.\" </p><p>\"When are you planning to give my car back to me?\" </p><p>Yang was wearing an agonized expression. Right now, he was driving his boss's Audi R8 to and from work, every day. Having to endure his co-workers' gossiping was one thing, but god knows how terrified he had been of accidentally scraping his boss's car. That wasn't something he could afford to pay compensation for. </p><p>Sure, his boss's car was insured. However, if he actually were to scratch his boss's precious car, then it wouldn't just be a matter of money. He might even lose his job. </p><p>To Yang, this assistant position had been like a pie that fell into his lap from the sky. </p><p>The last person on this position was a highly capable middle-aged lady. However, as soon as the new president took over the position, he promoted her to a director and transferred her to a branch company. The opening she had left behind was filled through external hiring. However, of all the applicants, the new president had chosen him, the most unimpressive of the bunch. </p><p>When GK called and told him to come to work, he thought it was a hoax. </p><p>Only later did he find out that rumors had it that the new president chose him for only two reasons. </p><p>First, he was a guy. The new president seemed to dislike unnecessary contact with women. </p><p>Second, he attended 2nd High School. Rumor had it that the president himself had been a student there. Technically, they were alumni of the same school. </p><p>Yang wasn't stupid. He had the vague impression that 2nd High seemed to hold some kind of significance to the new president. </p><p>However, the president was extremely unpredictable. First, he borrowed his Volkswagen CC. Then, he told him to drive his Audi R8. The situation left Yang rather depressed. </p><p>After listening to Yang's request, Qin Chu paused in thought. Then, he asked, \"Is my car not fast enough?\" </p><p>Yang shook his hands. \"No, no. It's way too fast.\" </p><p>\"Then you don't like the color?\" </p><p>\"No, no. Mr. Qin, I like the color, too. It's grand, classy, and obviously high-end.\" </p><p>\"Then, you think it's not eye-catching enough? If that's the case, I have other cars in my garage - Ferrari, Lamborghini...\" </p><p>Before Qin Chu had even finished, Yang was already on the verge of falling to his knees. </p><p>\"Mr. Qin. It's TOO eye-catching, and it doesn't fit someone of my station. I'm just an assistant. How could I afford to drive such an expensive car? For the past few days, I haven't even been able to sleep at night. During the day, I'm afraid it'll get scratched. At night, I worry that someone might steal it. Mr. Qin, please, spare me and give my car back to me.\" </p><p>Seeing Yang's sincerity, Qin Chu nodded after some thought. \"Fine, if it's troubling you that much, you can have your car back.\" </p><p>\"Thank you for your kindness.\" Yang finally let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>\"Give your store a call later. Order a car exactly like yours and have it delivered to me.\" </p><p>\"Wait…\" Once again, Yang was left dumbstruck. </p><p>He really didn't understand. Why would the president lower himself by insisting on driving a Volkswagen? Was it because it was made domestically? </p><p>Could the president be a true patriot? </p><p>After some silent debate in his head, Yang asked hesitantly, \"Sir, do you know how to sing the national anthem?\"</p><p>Qin Chu's brows furrowed slightly. He stared, perplexed, at this oddball assistant of his.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":64,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:11.777","Link":"Chapter-64","NameDisplay":"Chapter 64"},{"ID":181120948122545240,"Name":"Chapter 65: New Home","NameUnsign":"Chapter 65: New Home","Description":"<p>Chapter 65: New Home</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Boss, I'll go order your new car right now.\" Seeing the president's expression, Yang didn't dare chatter anymore and immediately left. </p><p>Qin Chu sat quietly in his office, bathed in gentle sunlight. </p><p>Carefully, he pulled open a drawer in his desk and took out a yellowing old photograph. He spent a long time staring at it in silence. </p><p>Finally, he carefully placed it back into his drawer. </p><p>- At the Department of Design - </p><p>Jiang Linyue heard that the president was in such a good mood today that he ordered double pay for everybody. She felt like a rare opportunity had presented itself. </p><p>At the end of the workday, Jiang Linyue deliberately walked to the president's office, strutting in seven-inch heels and holding a thick stack of documents. </p><p>As she had hoped, she arrived just in time to see Qin Chu leaving his office. </p><p>As he was about to pass her, Jiang Linyue intentionally lost her footing. </p><p>With that, all the documents she had been holding went flying out of her hands.</p><p>She also fell to the ground in a spectacular fashion. </p><p>It wasn't until her back hit the ground and she felt the pain of impact did Jiang Linyue realize something. </p><p>Wasn't the president supposed to catch her just in the nick of time, holding her in a gentle embrace? </p><p>At least, that was how it usually went in romance novels and prime-time drama series. </p><p>Could someone explain to her why it didn't work? </p><p>Qin Chu glanced down at the female employee who had fallen before him, his brows furrowing slightly. </p><p>Directly stepping over her would have been too ungentlemanly... </p><p>So, he walked around Jiang Linyue, treating her as just an obstacle. </p><p>After that, he also pulled out his cell phone and called Assistant Yang. </p><p>\"Boss, what can I help you with?\" </p><p>\"Inform admin: starting from tomorrow, all female employees are forbidden from wearing shoes with heels higher than three inches.\" </p><p>\"Um... Got it, sir.\" </p><p>Although Yang didn't know why the president would issue such a strange order, he knew that he had to do as he was told. </p><p>Jiang Linyue stared the president as he walked away, unsure whether she should cry or not. </p><p>What did she have to do to get closer to this dreamy hot piece of ass? Sensing the sharp pain in her ankle, she wondered if it was broken. </p><p>She had tried everything in order to draw the president's attention. </p><p>At home, Huo Mian took a hot shower, then did a heaping pile of laundry. Finally, she thoroughly cleaned the place. </p><p>As she was about to take a break, a knock was heard at the door. </p><p>She looked at the clock: it was 5:30 PM. At this hour, she was certain the person at her door was Qin Chu. </p><p>As expected, when she opened the door, she saw Qin Chu standing on the other side. </p><p>He was dressed in a navy blue, custom-made Italian suit. The fact that he hadn't yet changed meant that he had just gotten off work. </p><p>\"I'm here to pick you up. Let's go. </p><p>\"I still have a lot of stuff here. Let me bring them with me.\" </p><p>\"There's no need. I'll get someone to come and deal with the stuff here. Just bring your essentials. I'll wait for you in the car.\" </p><p>- Ten minutes later - </p><p>Huo Mian walked out from her room. In her arms, she held a cardboard box filled with some of her favorite books, along with a watermelon throw pillow. </p><p>She had been living here for over a year now. This sudden move made her realize that she was going to miss the place. </p><p>However, Qin Chu was right. Now that they were married, it would be a bit improper to continue living separately. </p><p>\"When they terminate the lease, don't forget to get the two thousand yuan I put up as deposit,\" Huo Mian reminded him as she sat down on the passenger seat. </p><p>Qin Chu didn't know what to say but nodded all the same. </p><p>As they drove on, Huo Mian felt unsettled. </p><p>After stewing over the issue for a long time, Huo Mian finally asked, \"Are we… going to be living with your parents?\" </p><p>\"Are you joking?\" </p><p>\"So, it's just going to be the two of us living together?\" Huo Mian perked up.</p><p>\"What do you think?\" Qin Chu replied with a question of his own.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":65,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:12.253","Link":"Chapter-65","NameDisplay":"Chapter 65"},{"ID":181120948127483779,"Name":"Chapter 66: Make Do","NameUnsign":"Chapter 66: Make Do","Description":"<p>Chapter 66: Make Do</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian bit her lips and didn't talk anymore. However, deep down, she let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>She genuinely disliked Qin Chu's parents and didn't want anything to do with them. </p><p>Half an hour later, they arrived at Imperial Park, the largest upscale residential area within the First Ring Road district. </p><p>Qin Chu's car slowly came to a stop. </p><p>Lifting her head, Huo Mian looked around at this luxurious neighborhood. </p><p>Sales for the homes here had opened two years ago and only closed last year. From what she had heard, the per-square-meter price had already exceeded eighty thousand yuan. </p><p>This was a well-known upper-class development site. According to rumors, a famous Feng-Shui practitioner from Hong Kong had been invited to look over the location. </p><p>The plot was bordered by a mountain and a lake, with a road to its left. As the people here said, this land bore the features of the four great beasts of legend: the green dragon, the white tiger, the vermilion bird, and the black turtle. </p><p>Because the area rests by the city's largest natural lake, the Jade Water Lake, the property values here remained high. </p><p>In a forum post, a netizen once joked that this land was really a treasure by Feng-Shui standards. If you flipped the direction, it would be on par with the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, a memorial tomb constructed by the government for one of the country's founding heroes. </p><p>\"Are we going to live here?\" </p><p>\"Yeah.\" Qin Chu nodded, then led Huo Mian inside. </p><p>The buildings were designed to be mini high-rises, and there was ample space between each of the buildings, allowing the sun to shine through. </p><p>The buildings were of English-style architecture with dark-red exteriors. Huo Mian quite liked it. </p><p>The lobby of the complex was lavishly decorated, like the décor in a five-star hotel. Qin Chu led Huo Mian into the spacious elevator and pressed the button for the sixteenth floor. </p><p>Looks like it's the top floor, Huo Mian thought to herself. </p><p>- A few seconds later - </p><p>The sixteenth floor opened up before them. Huo Mian looked around and realized that there was only one unit on the entire floor. </p><p>It seemed like there was the only unit on each floor, as expected from the wealthy. </p><p>Qin Chu took out a key and opened the door. Huo Mian followed him inside. </p><p>Her eyes lit up when she saw what was before her. </p><p>It was a spacious, bright two-story unit. The open design made it possible to see both floors from the door. The white European-style furnishings were stately, yet ornate. </p><p>A rough estimate placed the unit at more than two hundred square meters, at least. In a neighborhood with such astronomical property values, this was no doubt the luxury unit amongst luxury units. </p><p>\"We decided to get married so suddenly, and I didn't have time to pick an address. So, I bought this place on short notice. We'll make do here for a while. When the interior work in the South Hill Manor is complete, we'll move over there.\" </p><p>\"It's alright, I like it here.\" Huo Mian swallowed before she replied. </p><p>If she heard correctly, Qin Chu said that this place was only temporary. Did he just seriously say 'make do'? </p><p>Heavens, this was a place where one square meter went for eighty thousand yuan, in the real estate golden zone within the First Ring Road, located less than ten minutes from the First Hospital by foot. </p><p>This was a unit worth over ten million yuan, along with more than a million in furnishings, and here this guy was saying that they will 'make do for a while'. </p><p>\"Everything we need is here. If anything is missing, let me know. I'll have someone get it for us.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>Right then, Qin Chu's cell phone rang. </p><p>\"Hello. I'll be right over. Yeah, wait for me.\" Hanging up, Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian. \"I have to go back to my parents' place. Go ahead and get some rest.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded again. </p><p>As Qin Chu stood up and opened the door to leave, he suddenly seemed to remember something. Doubling back, he took out a key-card and a set of keys and placed them on Huo Mian's palm. </p><p>\"These are the keys. The ownership certificate is on the coffee table. They're yours to keep.\" </p><p>With that, Qin Chu turned and left. </p><p>Holding the keys, Huo Mian was in somewhat of a haze. Just like that, she had moved in with Qin Chu. </p><p>She glanced over at the certificate on the coffee table. Possessed, she walked over and pulled it open. As expected, the ownership was under her name. </p><p>She was surprised to realize that there were tears in her eyes. </p><p>It wasn't that a man spending money on another woman was necessarily a good thing. It was just that she understood Qin Chu too well. </p><p>While it was true that he was bossy and headstrong, he would always give you what he thought was best. It was how he showed that he cared. </p><p>He had been like that seven years ago, and he still was, seven years later. </p><p>Qin Chu was a man she had once loved, and what she felt for him were etched into her very bones. </p><p>Staring at the certificate, Huo Mian was stuck in a haze. Then, as though suddenly remembering something, she drew out her cell phone in a flash and opened her mobile banking app. </p><p>Entering the password, she checked the balance.</p><p>If she remembered correctly, Qin Chu said that he had transferred his income for the month to her card. She was extremely curious: just how much did the stuck-up Mr. Qin make?</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":66,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:12.75","Link":"Chapter-66","NameDisplay":"Chapter 66"},{"ID":181120948131762002,"Name":"Chapter 67: Prideful","NameUnsign":"Chapter 67: Prideful","Description":"<p>Chapter 67: Prideful</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>When Huo Mian saw the balance, she was shocked...</p><p>She carefully counted the zeroes, \"One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million?\"</p><p>That was right, adding on to the 800 yuan Huo Mian had before, she had a 1,000,800 in total.</p><p>So, did that mean Qin Chu's monthly salary was a million yuan?</p><p>Actually, a million was not a large amount of money for Qin Chu.

You're just in time for dinner, we've been waiting for you.\"</p><p>\"I'm not eating,\" said Qin Chu as he passed the crowd in order to go upstairs.</p><p>He only came back to get some things. Then, he would be officially moved out...</p><p>However, Qin Chu's parents didn't seem to know that their son was moving out...</p><p>They had invited a few friends, including two young girls who looked like spoiled and pampered socialites.</p><p>When Qin Chu walked down the stairs, he was carrying a paper bag containing his personal items.</p><p>\"Chu, let me introduce you.

Qin Chu's mom seized the opportunity to invite a few women who she often had afternoon tea with to join her at home with their daughters. She wanted to create an opportunity for her son, but he didn't let her; instead, he abruptly announced that he was moving out.</p><p>\"Your son seems to be very busy, haha,\" one of the women awkwardly said, attempting to amend the situation.</p><p>Mrs. Qin laughed and said, \"Don't mind him. It hasn't been long since he came back, and he has been busy since he became the president of GK. He rarely even eats dinner with us.\"</p><p>\"It's fine, young people these days are all workaholics. It's good to be busy,\" another chuckled.</p><p>\"Auntie Qin, Qin Chu is so handsome! He's my type.\" The daughter of the Gao family shyly smiled.</p><p>\"Qin Chu is so prideful, but I like it,\" the other girl commented in satisfaction.</p><p>Mrs. Qin dryly laughed and said, \"Mhm, next time I'll invite him to dinner with you.

His fingers danced on the keyboard of his laptop; it looked like he was busy working.</p><p>\"Mhm,\" Huo Mian drowsily replied.</p><p>\"I cooked, let's eat together.\"</p><p>He did not wait for a reply from Huo Mian as he put down his laptop and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>Then, he brought out two servings of toast, bacon, and hot coffee.</p><p>Huo Mian wanted to say that she wasn't hungry, but, as she opened her mouth, her stomach immediately betrayed her and rumbled.</p><p>Qin Chu put the toast and coffee in front of her on the coffee table.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't want to seem stuck up, so she slowly dug in.</p><p>Perhaps it was her hunger, or maybe some other reason, but the food was delicious.</p><p>Honey and butter were smeared on the toast, making it so f*cking sweet. It just so happened that Huo Mian had a sweet tooth.</p><p>Watching Huo Mian silently eat his food, Qin Chu's gaze became soft in an instant...</p><p>Just then, Qin Chu's phone rang...</p><p>He put down his mug and slowly answered his phone...</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Son, why did you move out all of a sudden?\" Mrs. Qin seemed to be taking the situation seriously.</p><p>\"I've been busy at work and am always working overtime. It's not convenient to always drive back and forth.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to move out though, where's your new house? Are there maids, chauffeurs, and cleaners?\"</p><p>\"Mom, I can take care of myself.\"</p><p>\"Son… If you're not used to living alone, please move back. I'm worried about you.\"</p><p>\"Mom, I am an adult.\"</p><p>\"I know, but you're forever my baby boy. Chu, what do you think about the two girls I brought home tonight?\" Mrs. Qin finally got to her point.</p><p>\"I didn't like them.\"</p><p>\"Was it their looks, or their height? Tell me what you want in a woman. I'll keep an eye out for you.\" Mrs. Qin attempted to convince her son.</p><p>As Qin Chu was holding the phone, he looked at Huo Mian, who was drinking coffee.</p><p>Then, enunciating every word, Qin Chu said, \"Mom, my standards for is… 24 years old, 165 centimeters tall, weighs 50 kilograms, has long black hair, big eyes, doesn't wear makeup, likes wearing white tees and jeans, and has dimples when she smiles.\"</p><p>When Huo Mian heard that, she lowered her head in embarrassment.</p><p>She didn't like being a narcissist, but she felt like Qin Chu was describing her.</p><p>\"Wait a second, let me note that down. Son, I'll try my best to find you a girl like that.\" On the other side of the phone, Mrs. Qin took Qin Chu's words seriously.</p><p>\"Good, that's all. Goodnight.\" After speaking, Qin Chu hung up without waiting for a reply.</p><p>After silently finishing her food, Huo Mian took the dishes into the kitchen.</p><p>As she turned around, she bumped into Qin Chu...</p><p>She didn't know what he was doing in the kitchen at that time.</p><p>They were so close together that it made Huo Mian nervous.</p><p>Qin Chu's hands were against the wall, surrounding Huo Mian with his arms.

He walked up to the sink and began washing the used utensils.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't know what she was supposed to do...</p><p>When Qin Chu finished washing the utensils and exited the kitchen, Huo Mian was still sitting on the sofa. It was already ten o'clock at night.</p><p>\"It's late, we should… sleep.\" With his hands in his pocket, Qin Chu leaned against the doorway and looked at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"I'm not tired, you should sleep first,\" Huo Mian awkwardly replied.</p><p>\"Are you afraid of sleeping with me?\" The corners of Qin Chu's mouth raised up into a smirk.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":68,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:13.647","Link":"Chapter-68","NameDisplay":"Chapter 68"},{"ID":18112094814134715,"Name":"Chapter 69: Separate Rooms","NameUnsign":"Chapter 69: Separate Rooms","Description":"<p>Chapter 69: Separate Rooms</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian didn't expect Qin Chu to be so direct and, therefore, was slightly taken aback. </p><p>Then she blushed.</p><p>\"No,\" she replied. </p><p>\"If you're not afraid, then what are you waiting for? Go to bed.\" With that, Qin Chu turned around and walked upstairs towards the bedroom. </p><p>That night, before Qin Chu had come home, Huo Mian already roughly familiarized herself with the structure of the condo. </p><p>It was a two hundred square meter, two-level unit. There was a spacious living room, dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and study downstairs. </p><p>The upper level seemed to consist of three bedrooms and a bathroom. </p><p>With a setup like this, there would be enough space to house the two of them even if they had two children. </p><p>Watching Qin Chu climb up the stairs, Huo Mian immediately regretted her big mouth. Why did she have to respond so carelessly? </p><p>Now, look what she had done. If she didn't follow him, it would seem like she was going back on her word. However, she really wasn't ready. </p><p>Seven years ago, she loved Qin Chu with all her heart, but it didn't mean things were still the same now. </p><p>Truth be told, she didn't even know how she felt about Qin Chu. </p><p>She had agreed to marry him purely to ensure Zhixin's wellbeing. </p><p>Of course, there had been some degree of personal emotions mixed in as well... </p><p>Qin Chu entered the first bedroom on the second floor, and Huo Mian slowly followed him inside. </p><p>The room was spacious, with black-and-white décor. It suited Qin Chu's style. </p><p>\"What did you follow me in for? How badly do you want to want to sleep in the same bed as me?\" Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian with a half-joking expression. </p><p>Huo Mian, caught by surprise, didn't know how to react. </p><p>\"Your bedroom is next door, good night.\" With that, Qin Chu closed the door with a thump. </p><p>He left Huo Mian outside, with an innocent look on her face. </p><p>Huo Mian hadn't yet figured out how to react, and her adorkable expression nearly broke Qin Chu's self-restraint. All he wanted was to go over and kiss her for all he was worth. </p><p>After Qin Chu closed the door, he slowly leaned against it. </p><p>Although he wanted more than anything to hold her as they fell asleep, he knew that she wasn't ready for that yet. </p><p>He didn't want to force her. He wanted to give her time. </p><p>Time to slowly get back to where they were seven years ago. </p><p>Besides, she was already legally his wife, wasn't she? </p><p>At this thought, Qin Chu's lips tugged into a contented smile. </p><p>Only then did Huo Mian fully process what Qin Chu had just said. She walked over to the second bedroom and pushed open the door. </p><p>The interior was decorated in light beige, accented with purple. These were all colors she liked. </p><p>So, he still remembers everything and prepared this room for her in advance... </p><p>She thought that he would force her, but he didn't.</p><p>\"Qin Chu… what am I to do with you?\" Caressing the white vanity table, Huo Mian's expression became sorrowful. </p><p>She admitted that she no longer had much hatred left in her. </p><p>Every time she needed help, this man had always been there. </p><p>But… if you love me that much, why did you disappear for seven years? </p><p>We've already wasted seven years… </p><p>Huo Mian spent a long time in melancholy. In the end, she went to the en-suite bathroom for a hot bath. When she came out, she laid down on the bed, exhausted. </p><p>She had always been picky about beds. In the past, whenever she was out of the city and had to stay at a hotel, she would always have trouble sleeping. </p><p>She thought that tonight would be no different. However, to her surprise, she slept astonishingly well. </p><p>The light fragrance of lavender filled the room, along with dreamlike multicolored lights. Every detail had been designed with care. </p><p>Huo Mian found it hard to believe that Qin Chu bought this condo on short notice. How could everything be so perfect? </p><p>- Late that night -</p><p>Filtering through the window, faint moonlight spilled into the room. </p><p>Quietly, Qin Chu pushed open the door and walked inside. He stood quietly by the window. </p><p>Staring down at the sleeping girl on the bed, his eyes were filled with tenderness. </p><p>No one knew just how long he had been waiting for this day...</p><p>Just as no one knew how much he loved this woman named Huo Mian. </p><p>- The next morning - </p><p>Although it was only 7 AM when Huo Mian got up, Qin Chu was already nowhere to be found. </p><p>A sandwich sat ready on the table, along with a glass of milk. </p><p>Huo Mian had to admit that she was touched by his gesture. </p><p>Before, when she lived under the same roof as Ning Zhiyuan, she was always the one who cooked. </p><p>By and by, she had grown used to it. </p><p>Today, seeing that someone had prepared breakfast for her, she felt an indescribable warmth rise within her. </p><p>- At GK Headquarters - </p><p>Walking through the door, Assistant Yang heard the president's computer playing music. </p><p>After he realized what the song was, he nearly choked on his own spit.</p><p>\"Pre… President Qin,\" Yang stuttered.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":69,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:14.137","Link":"Chapter-69","NameDisplay":"Chapter 69"},{"ID":18112094814610890,"Name":"Chapter 70: Threat","NameUnsign":"Chapter 70: Threat","Description":"<p>Chapter 70: Threat</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Qin Chu raised his head from behind a pile of documents. He didn't make a sound, but his eyes were clearly saying 'whatever it is, just say it.' </p><p>\"President Qin, your car is ready. The people from the store just delivered it and left it in the garage. You can use it at any time.\" </p><p>\"Got it.\" With only a two-word reply, Qin Chu went back to his work. </p><p>The song, however, was still playing on repeat. </p><p>\"I really wish there was someone with me when I'm lonely, </p><p>That even on the busiest days, someone's there to eat breakfast with me, </p><p>Although this kind of thinking is clearly too naïve, </p><p>No matter where tomorrow lies, I just want someone with me. </p><p>There's never room in love for multitasking, </p><p>Won't it be a shame to miss out on a meeting that happened so naturally, </p><p>If I truly decide to give my heart to you, </p><p>Can someone tell her, please don't hurt me. </p><p>Every time love is near, </p><p>You feel her holding you tightly. </p><p>She riles up your heart, covers your eyes, yet doesn't let you know where she's going, </p><p>Every time love is near, it's like she's waiting to see your reaction. </p><p>Heaven and earth fall silent, the only disturbance is your decision.\" </p><p>The reason Yang thought this was bizarre was that, before, the president usually played piano music from either Chopin, Mozart, Richard Clayderman, or Franz Liszt. </p><p>Yang was a man without much taste for music. Therefore, even when listening to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, he couldn't really appreciate it. </p><p>But his boss was different. People say that the president was a genius, and, having studied abroad for seven years, he naturally had a different taste than the rest of them. </p><p>However, today, music from legendary musicians were suddenly swapped to \"Love is Near\" by Rene 'Milk Tea' Liu. </p><p>That was a hell of a difference. Most importantly, when did the president start getting into cutesy indie-pop? </p><p>\"President Qin?\" </p><p>\"Anything else?\" Qin Chu looked up at Yang, who stood stuttering, unsure if he should speak. </p><p>\"I like this song, too. My wife and I are both fans of Milk Tea.\" A little embarrassed, Yang scratched his head and smiled. </p><p>\"Who is Milk Tea?\" Qin Chu's reply nearly made Yang faint on the spot. </p><p>What was wrong with the president? If he didn't know who Milk Tea was, why was he listening to her song on repeat? </p><p>What kind of a fan was he? </p><p>\"Milk Tea… Uh… She's Rene Liu, the one singing this song.\" </p><p>\"Oh.\" Qin Chu finally understood. </p><p>The USB in his computer today wasn't the one he usually listened to. </p><p>Yesterday, the movers he sent to terminate the lease on Huo Mian's apartment had reportedly found this USB on Huo Mian's laptop. </p><p>Thinking that these might all be songs Huo Mian liked, Qin Chu had spent the entire morning tirelessly listening to them. </p><p>No wonder Yang was weirded out... </p><p>After breakfast, Huo Mian went to work. Inside the VIP suite, Jing Zhixin had already regained consciousness. </p><p>Although he was still very groggy, the doctor had said that his vitals were good and that he only needed to rest more. </p><p>Huo Mian stayed with Jing Zhixin for a while. Finally, after her brother had fallen asleep, she slowly left the room. </p><p>Just as she got outside, her phone began to ring urgently. </p><p>Huo Mian took a look and saw that it was an unfamiliar number. </p><p>\"Hello?\" </p><p>\"Miss Huo Mian, I am Mr. Luo, the attorney.\" </p><p>\"What do you want?\" After hearing his introduction, Huo Mian's tone grew noticeably colder. </p><p>\"I just wanted to remind you to consider our offer carefully.\" </p><p>\"I've made my position very clear already. I don't want to repeat myself.\" </p><p>\"If you continue to be so unreasonable… We will be unable to guarantee the safety of you and your family.\" </p><p>\"Are you threatening me?\" </p><p>\"Miss Huo, you're a clever lady. I need not say anymore.\" </p><p>\"What if I told you my cell phone has an inbuilt recorder? I'll hand it over to the court as evidence against you.\" Huo Mian was furious. </p><p>Mr. Luo chuckled. \"You think I'd be afraid? You had better be more careful. I've said it before: my client has a strong background. He's not someone who can be swayed by an ordinary person like you.\" </p><p>\"Just because we're ordinary, we should let you walk all over us? What a joke. Why don't you go to Hell?\" With that, Huo Mian mercilessly hung up the phone.</p><p>\"Miss Huo, someone's looking for you.\" </p><p>\"Okay, coming.\" Hearing the call, Huo Mian immediately began walking towards the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department.</p><p>When Huo Mian recognized the person at the door of the examination room, she was clearly displeased. \"It's you?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":70,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:14.613","Link":"Chapter-70","NameDisplay":"Chapter 70"},{"ID":18112094815517476,"Name":"Chapter 71: Rumors","NameUnsign":"Chapter 71: Rumors","Description":"<p>Chapter 71: Rumors</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Hi there, Mian, my little sister. It's only been a few days since we last met, but you've gotten even prettier.\" </p><p>Huo Siqian was dressed in a mulberry blazer with black dress pants. Each article of clothing on him was from a luxury designer brand. </p><p>Unlike Qin Chu, his taste in clothing leaned toward the ostentatious, preferring brighter colors such as pink and dark purple. </p><p>Huo Siqian was 29 years old and fairly good-looking in a gentlemanly kind of way. </p><p>This, along with the fact that he was the Huo Corporation's Vice President, made him quite popular in high-society circles. </p><p>He was also supposedly the ultimate playboy. His female companions ranged from celebrities and international supermodels to cultured heiresses; he had had more girlfriends than he had fingers. He frequently appeared in entertainment magazines. Nonetheless, the public opinion of him was very high. </p><p>He was said to be the future helmsman of the Huo Corporation. Evidently, despite being an adopted son, his status had exceeded that of the siblings borne by Huo Zhenghai's mistress.</p><p>Wherever he went, Huo Siqian wore bedroom eyes and a fox-like smile. He was well-liked by women. </p><p>The young nurses at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department were all enamored and stole glances at him. </p><p>\"How many times have I said this, don't call me that. I'm not your little sister.\" Huo Mian's reaction was uncharacteristically cold. </p><p>\"Alright, Huo Mian. I have a favor to ask of you today. I have a female friend who wants to get a gynecology checkup, but your hospital's specialist appointments are really hard to make. Luckily, I remembered that you worked in the OB/GYN Department. Can you ask around and see if you can get an appointment for her?\" </p><p>\"No. I'm just an intern nurse, and I don't have that kind of authority. Mr. Huo, with your influence, you can go straight to the director.\" </p><p>With that, Huo Mian turned around and walked into the OB/GYN Department examination room, not paying him any more attention. </p><p>Huo Siqian, on the other hand, didn't seem upset at all. He only gave a dry smile. </p><p>As the Vice President of the Huo Corporation, he could obviously get an express pass at any hospital. There was really no need for him to ask a little gopher like Huo Mian. </p><p>However, he especially liked making contact with her. Whenever he saw her, his mood would unexplainably brighten. </p><p>Right then, a woman with delicate features walked out from the OB/GYN attendings' outpatient room. She looped her hands affectionately around Huo Siqian's arm. </p><p>\"Siqian, the doctor said I've caught a chill. He told me to eat less seafood. It looks like we can't go to the beach during the holidays anymore.\" </p><p>\"That's alright, I'll warm you up when we get home.\" </p><p>\"Oh, stop it, you. Heh, you're always toying with me,\" the woman whined playfully. After that, the two turned around and walked away. </p><p>\"Sister Huo, who was that just now?\" One of the nurses, Huang Yue asked, intrigued. \"He's pretty good looking, and he's wearing designer clothing. He's clearly some kind of rich boy.\" </p><p>\"He's a friend of a friend of a friend. I don't know him well either.\" Huo Mian never really liked talking about the Huo Family. </p><p>\"Huang Yue, you dummy. Don't you read the newspaper? Wasn't that Prince Huo? As expected from one of C City's Four Princes, he is both handsome and rich. He's so much better looking in person than in his photos. The only downside is that he's a bit of a playboy,\" one of the other younger nurses said. </p><p>\"Four Princes? I've never heard of them,\" Huang Yue said, perplexed. </p><p>\"That's why I said you're from the countryside. The Four Princes are considered the most eligible bachelors in high society, all supposedly unmarried. Huo Siqian is ranked second. From what I've heard, the third prince is the second son of Southern City Corporation's Wei Family, Wei Liao, and the fourth is the son of the president of Beiyang Automotive, Shen Mingxi.\" </p><p>\"Hm? Then who's the first?\" Huang Yue was even more curious. </p><p>\"The first? That person is something else. He's also my dream boyfriend. He's our city's most handsome and wealthy Super Crown Prince, Su Yu.\"</p><p>\"Huh? Su Yu… I think I've heard of him. Isn't his dad the guy who's ranked in Forbes' top five? The one who started off in private banking? They say his family's bank has now spread across the country,\" Huang Yue said, fascinated. </p><p>\"Yeah, but Prince Su owns his own entertainment company, specializing in creating superstars. Out of the four most popular divas in the entertainment scene right now, two belong to Prince Su's label.\" </p><p>Huo Mian listened quietly, not interjecting. She had no interest in these things whatsoever. </p><p>Just then, an older nurse walked in and threw them a look of disdain.</p><p>\"What Four Princes?\" She said, \"you're way behind the times. Right now, the hottest new bachelor is the Prince of the GK Corporation. Rumors say he's been back in the country for nearly a month now and has already secretly taken over the company. But he's apparently very modest and doesn't accept any interviews from the media. I heard that he's super good-looking. I really wish I could see him for myself.\" </p><p>\"Really? GK's heir? Why haven't I heard about him?\" one of the young nurses muttered. </p><p>Huang Yue, on the other hand, interjected excitedly, \"I know that GK's Prince went to 2nd High School. My older sister went there as well, just a year after him. I know that his name is Qin Chu, but they said that he left the country for a long time. Did he come back? Why hasn't there been any news?\"</p><p>With that, Huang Yue tugged at Huo Mian, \"Miss Huo, didn't you go to 2nd High School as well? You should know more, right? Come on, tell us about this Prince of GK. I really want to know. My sister once said that Qin Chu was super hot.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":71,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:15.053","Link":"Chapter-71","NameDisplay":"Chapter 71"},{"ID":181120948155034063,"Name":"Chapter 72: Opinion","NameUnsign":"Chapter 72: Opinion","Description":"<p>Chapter 72: Opinion</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>For a moment, Huo Mian didn't even know how to answer the question. </p><p>\"Um… I don't know him that well.\" Not wanting to cause a fuss, she merely glossed over the subject. </p><p>Upon hearing this, the three other nurses all seemed a little disappointed. </p><p>While the OB/GYN Department wasn't busy, Huo Mian went to the VIP suite to see her brother. </p><p>However, at the door, she ran into the family of the patient from the other day. It was the mother of another boy injured in the vehicle pile-up. She was a plump middle-aged woman dressed in a conspicuous red dress. </p><p>\"Hey, wait a minute.\" </p><p>\"What is it?\" Huo Mian turned her head to face her. </p><p>\"I heard you wouldn't settle the matter in private. It that true?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"Did they not give you enough money? How much did they give you?\" The middle-aged woman's eyes shone shrewdly. She seemed to be trying to get Huo Mian to disclose some information that could benefit her. However, Huo Mian wasn't an idiot. </p><p>\"No, I didn't accept the compensation.\" </p><p>\"Didn't accept the compensation? Why not? You couldn't make a deal? Let me tell you, you should take the opportunity and ask for a bit more. I heard your brother's injury was in the head? You can exaggerate it, say that he suffered permanent damage and might become a retard, or that he can't take care of himself anymore. They'd give you a fair bit more that way.\" With that, the woman intentionally lowered her voice, \"Did you know? I heard that the kid's parents work in the Ministry of Finance. Not only are they rich, they have power too.\" </p><p>\"I will take regular legal actions and sue him. I won't take any compensation. The perpetrator needs to be held responsible.\" With that, Huo Mian turned around and entered the suite, not willing to continue the conversation. </p><p>The middle-aged woman was left stunned for a moment. Then, she rolled her eyes and spat, \"Is this girl's head rusted or something?\"</p><p>- Inside the suite - </p><p>Since he woke up, aside from looking a bit sallow, Jing Zhixin had been doing quite well. </p><p>Huo Mian hired a caretaker, who takes turns watching over him with their mother. She herself often came by as well. </p><p>\"You look better than you did yesterday.\" Walking inside, Huo Mian smiled. </p><p>\"Sis.\" Jing Zhixin returned the smile after seeing Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Weren't you on duty? What are you doing here?\" Their mother's tone was still cold. </p><p>\"The department isn't busy today, so I took some time off to come take a look. How are you, Zhixin? Does anything feel wrong today?\" Huo Mian touched her brother's forehead. </p><p>Jing Zhixin shook his head. \"Nope, I'm great. Don't worry, Sis.\" </p><p>\"What did they say about the compensation? I heard those people contacted you,\" Yang Meirong asked while knitting. </p><p>Huo Mian paused, then replied, \"Mom, I gave up the compensation. We have enough money for the surgery anyway, and Zhixin's procedure was successful. So, I didn't accept the compensation. I want to go to court, so the perpetrator will receive the punishment he deserves. Otherwise, he'll deal with us with money and continue evading the law. My little brother nearly died. Whenever I think of that, I just can't let it go.\" </p><p>She had thought that her mother would give her a verbal lashing. After all, the lawyer offered her a hefty compensation. </p><p>However, to her surprise, her mother didn't. She only gave her a grudging glance and asked, \"Didn't they say that the guy had a powerful background? If we sue and lose, wouldn't we lose more than we gain?\" </p><p>\"We won't, we can't lose. The perpetrator was racing inside a school campus, not to mention drinking and speeding. Having caused such a serious incident, he's obviously in the wrong. We won't lose unless the judge is completely blind. Anyway, even if his family has enough power to suppress the incident, I can always go to the media, or post it online in forums. Basically, once this incident gets public attention, the authorities won't stand by and let it happen. I believe that, no matter how powerful they are, they can't control everything.\" </p><p>After Huo Mian had finished, Jing Zhixin gave a sweet, toothy smile. \"Sis, you're so smart. You've thought of everything.\"</p><p>Yang Meirong, on the other hand, rolled her eyes at Huo Mian. \"If you've already decided, then sort this thing out,\" she said. \"But… how are you going to pay back the money you borrowed? Wouldn't it be a pity to give up the compensation completely? With your crappy salary, who knows how long it would take for you to pay it back? You sure know how to make a mess of things.

If we do things the normal way and they lose the lawsuit, they'll have to give compensation too. It's just that it might not be as much as they would give for a private settlement. Normally speaking, they have to provide Zhixin's medical fees. All we're giving up on is the compensation for the so-called nutritional fees and emotional damages. We won't ask for too much. I don't want to use my little brother's wellbeing as leverage to get rich. Once we win the case, they still have to give us the basic things. So don't worry about the money.\" </p><p>\"Sis, you make it sound so complicated. How could Mom understand? Why don't you just tell her, if we settle privately, they might give us 1,000,000 yuan in compensation. But if we go through the court process, after the ruling, they might only have to give us 300,000 to cover the medical fees. It's quite a difference in terms of money. Is that right?\" </p><p>After Jing Zhixin had finished, Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>Yang Meirong didn't say much, but lowered her head and said quietly, \"I hope everything can go smoothly.\" </p><p>Huo Mian could tell that, even though her mother didn't put on a good face, she still agreed with her way of doing things. </p><p>Right then, a knock sounded at the door. </p><p>Huo Mian was beyond nervous. She was really afraid that Qin Chu would suddenly come to the hospital without warning. </p><p>If that happened, and her mom saw Qin Chu, it would make the situation unthinkably tense. </p><p>The person who walked in after the knock allowed Huo Mian to let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>It was Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>\"Brother Zhiyuan,\" Jing Zhixin said quietly. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was wearing a white lab coat as if he had just gotten off from a shift. </p><p>In his hand was a fruit basket. He first looked at Huo Mian, a mix of emotions on his face. </p><p>Then, he greeted Huo Mian's mother, \"Auntie.\" </p><p>\"What are you doing here? Didn't you two break up?\" Yang Meirong said with a stern expression. </p><p>\"I came to see Zhixin. He's recovering well. Get well soon,\" Ning Zhiyuan said, setting down the fruit basket. </p><p>\"Thank you, Brother Zhiyuan.\" Jing Zhixin smiled. </p><p>\"Mian…\" Gazing at Huo Mian, he opened his mouth but didn't seem to know what to say. </p><p>\"Yeah.\" </p><p>\"Can you come out for a moment? I have something to tell you.\" </p><p>\"Whatever it is, you can say it here. My Mom and Brother aren't outsiders.\" After she had gone to Ning Zhiyuan's new home the other day, ran into him sleeping with another woman, and was refused the money she had paid for the downpayment, Huo Mian no longer had a shred of feelings left for him. </p><p>Before this, she would have at least be thankful for the way he had courted her back when they were still in school. </p><p>Only now did she know that a man could change so mercilessly. </p><p>If Ning Zhiyuan had helped her then, she wouldn't have had to beg Qin Chu. </p><p>In the end, she was left with no other choice but to marry Qin Chu. </p><p>At the end of the day, Ning Zhiyuan had become a catalyst for the way things have become. </p><p>Now that it came to this, Huo Mian really had nothing left to say to him. </p><p>Hearing Huo Mian's words, Ning Zhiyuan became somewhat embarrassed. </p><p>Then, he coughed before speaking, \"Mian, I didn't expect this to happen. Back then… I was mad with jealousy too. We've been together for more than three years. You should know how I feel about you. It's not that I didn't want to help you. I heard that Zhixin's surgery was paid for with money you borrowed from somewhere else. I'd like to help you pay that back. I can sell the apartment and the car. Your family is my family and Zhixin is my little brother. Can we go back to…\" </p><p>Before Ning Zhiyuan had a chance to finish, Huo Mian cut him off. </p><p>\"We can't.\" </p><p>\"Mian, are you really not going to give me another chance?\" Ning Zhiyuan begged. </p><p>Huo Mian lifted her head. Looking into Ning Zhiyuan's eyes, she said clearly, \"All I know is, when I had no choice but to ask you for help when my brother was lying in a hospital bed waiting for money to save his life, you were in the home we down-paid together screwing around with another woman. Ning Zhiyuan, I'm not that dumb, and you aren't either. Please, stop clinging to our past. You didn't help me, and I don't blame you. But now, the way you're trying to act nice after the fact, it's disgusting.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's words left Ning Zhiyuan with nothing but shame. </p><p>At the same time, he was surprised. To him, Huo Mian had always been a gentle girl. Why was she now so sharp-tongued? She seemed like a different person. Her words cut him like knives, leaving him unable to respond. </p><p>\"Mian… I think you've changed,\" Ning Zhiyuan said after a long moment of hesitation.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled faintly at his remarks.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":73,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:15.95","Link":"Chapter-73","NameDisplay":"Chapter 73"},{"ID":181120948164469188,"Name":"Chapter 74: The Real Her","NameUnsign":"Chapter 74: The Real Her","Description":"<p>Chapter 74: The Real Her</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You're wrong. I didn't change. I have always been like this, which means… these past few years, you never really gotten to know me at all. You loved the woman you created in your mind, not the real me.\" </p><p>In truth, Huo Mian wanted to say this a long time ago… </p><p>When she first met Ning Zhiyuan, she had already painted herself as the most ordinary girl. </p><p>After her relationship with Qin Chu, which was already etched in her memory, her heart had been as peaceful as the ocean for a long time. </p><p>Therefore, the gentle, understanding, and smart woman that Ning Zhiyuan saw wasn't the real Huo Mian. </p><p>Humans were the smartest animals in this world. Sometimes, the person you saw was just the one she wanted to show you, rather than who she really was... </p><p>Only Qin Chu knew who Huo Mian really was. </p><p>She was a quick-witted, smart, and sharp-mouthed girl who turned her nose up at everything. Just the way Zhu Lingling described her. That was the real her. Unfortunately, she never let Ning Zhiyuan see her real side these past few years. </p><p>Now that they broke up, he finally had a chance to see the real her. How ironic… </p><p>\"Mian…?\"Ning Zhiyuan seemed like he still wanted to say something. </p><p>\"Enough. You don't have to say anything else. I get it. When my daughter came to you for help, you were messing around with another woman in your apartment? Now you've come to repent because you heard that Zhixin has recovered, and the operation fees are paid off. You are not a man. Before, I thought that, although you haven't achieved much, at least you were honest and genuine. Now I see your true colors. You are nothing but a dishonest person who only likes to contribute after the fact. Don't go around sighing here and there, it annoys me. Get out. Since you two already broke up, I am no longer your soon-to-be mother-in-law, nor is Zhixin your brother.\" </p><p>\"Auntie…\" </p><p>\"Get out and take your insincere guilt basket with you.\" After they finished talking, Yang Meirong stood up, picked up the gift basket, and pushed it, along with Ning Zhiyuan, out of the room. </p><p>\"Mom, well done. You really vented Huo Mian's anger.\" Jing Zhixin gave her a thumbs-up. </p><p>Yang Meirong glanced at Huo Mian coldly, \"In the future, pick a better man. This one was trash.\" </p><p>\"I got it. Mom, I'm going back to my department for now. Don't wear yourself out. The caretaker is going to be here soon so you should go home and get some rest.\" </p><p>Walking out of the patient's room, Huo Mian felt restless… </p><p>Although her mother was not nice to her, she was clearly on her side, defending her in front of Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>But how would her mother react if she found out that not only was she secretly involved with Qin Chu again but was also now married to him? </p><p>She would strip off her skin... </p><p>Even though Uncle Jing's death had nothing to do with Qin Chu, his death was caused by the Qin family after all. </p><p>Thinking of this, Huo Mian's chest felt tight. She had no clue how to keep on living with Qin Chu. </p><p>After Uncle Jing's death, she felt guilty for seven years. She gave up on opportunities to go study overseas and chose not to attend the best medical school in Jing City. </p><p>She stayed home and became the most ordinary person. But still, she couldn't ditch that guilt. </p><p>What killed her the most was that she didn't hate Qin Chu that much… </p><p>She felt like she let Uncle Jing down… </p><p>- 9 PM - </p><p>Huo Mian had taken a shift for her colleague. Exhausted, she changed into her clothes and walked out of the hospital. </p><p>She looked down and took out her phone. It had died in the afternoon, and she had to charge it with her portable battery pack. </p><p>As soon as her phone turned on again, she began receiving a ton of missed call notifications, and a text message… </p><p>\"What time do you get off? I thought you weren't on the night shift today. Why haven't you gone home yet?\" </p><p>It was from Qin Chu… </p><p>Huo Mian yawned and tried to respond to that message. </p><p>Then, she heard a piercing screech from car tires speeding straight at her.

She just stood there like a deer in headlights, trying to block out the light with her hand. </p><p>It didn't occur to her that she was standing in the most dangerous spot. If this car came, it most likely would squash her. </p><p>She didn't get to respond after she heard someone calling her name. Huo Mian only felt something suddenly bump into her, and she was sent flying.  </p><p>Her ribs were throbbing… </p><p>The next time she opened her eyes, she found herself lying in a soft embrace. </p><p>\"Qin Chu, when did you get here?\" Huo Mian was still frightened and a little stunned. </p><p>Why did he show up right here, right now? </p><p>Qin Chu held Huo Mian tight. They laid on the road next to an electric pole, their bodies close together. </p><p>\"Are you alright?\" Qin Chu's voice sounded a little hoarse. Heavens knew that, in that second, his heart almost burst out from his chest. </p><p>\"Ye…yeah,\" Huo Mian stuttered slightly. </p><p>Then she stood up and checked her wounds. She realized that other than Qin Chu hurting her ribs when he crashed into her, there were no other injuries.  </p><p>When she turned around and looked at Qin Chu, she was a little shocked, \"You hurt your hand.\" </p><p>\"I'm fine, it's just a little scratch.\" </p><p>\"No, let me wrap you up. Otherwise it will get infected.\" Huo Mian pulled Qin Chu towards the hospital. </p><p>\"We have a first-aid kit at home, you can help me out there.\" After he finished talking, Qin Chu tightly flipped his hand over to grab hers while saying, \"It's late. Let's go home.\" </p><p>Then, he took Huo Mian's hand and took her to that white, low-key, Volkswagen CC. The two of them got in the car. </p><p>In the passenger seat, Huo Mian struggled for a while before asking, \"Just now…why were you there?\" </p><p>\"Shouldn't you be asking why that car suddenly accelerated in front of the hospital?\" Qin Chu answered with another question. </p><p>\"Answer my question first.\" </p><p>\"I couldn't get ahold of you and you didn't text me back. After I got off work, I came to the hospital to wait for you.\" </p><p>\"What time did you get here?\" Huo Mian turned to look at Qin Chu with surprise. </p><p>\"Six.\" </p><p>\"So you waited from six to nine?\" Huo Mian couldn't believe it. </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"You were just waiting in the car?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"You are so…?\" Huo Mian didn't know what to say. She wanted to say Qin Chu was a fool, but clearly he wasn't. </p><p>\"You're lucky that I came. Otherwise you would have been run over.\" </p><p>Now Huo Mian understood. Qin Chu came to pick her up and was in the car the whole time. When he saw her walk out of the hospital, he got out of the car to call out her name. </p><p>But right at that second, a truck came out of nowhere. </p><p>In that moment of life or death, Qin Chu dashed over, tackled Huo Mian, and dodged the big truck. They both fell safely to the curb. </p><p>At that moment, they had almost crossed the thin line between life and death… </p><p>\"Do you know that you almost died?\" Huo Mian asked, staring at Qin Chu. </p><p>\"I only know that if I didn't do what I did, you would have died,\" Qin Chu answered calmly. </p><p>\"Was it worth it?\" Huo Mian's eyes started tingling. She turned her head to look out the window when she asked him this question. </p><p>\"It was very much worth it.\" </p><p>\"You are such an idiot. You're the prince of GK, whose net worth is in the hundreds of millions. Why would you risk everything to save a nurse intern?\" </p><p>Qin Chu leaned in. He stared into Huo Mian's eyes and said slowly, \"At that moment, it was simply a husband saving a wife. Don't overthink it.\" </p><p>\"Qin Chu…\" </p><p>\"Don't you think that us together was a mistake this whole time?\" Huo Mian asked gently.</p><p>Having heard this, Qin Chu's hands slightly froze on the steering wheel…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":75,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:16.947","Link":"Chapter-75","NameDisplay":"Chapter 75"},{"ID":181120948175092569,"Name":"Chapter 76: Memories","NameUnsign":"Chapter 76: Memories","Description":"<p>Chapter 76: Memories</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>After a while, Qin Chu answered slowly, \"All I know is that the seven years apart from you was the biggest mistake of my life.\" </p><p>These words thudded in Huo Mian's heart, as though something was softly broken. </p><p>She didn't know what it was; maybe it was the wall surrounding her heart… </p><p>Then, they both remained silent for the rest of the trip… </p><p>It was only 9:20 PM when they got back to Imperial Park. </p><p>Qin Chu helped Huo Mian get out the first-aid kit from the cabinet in the living room. </p><p>Then, they sat on the couch as Huo Mian carefully dealt with Qin Chu's wounds.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't just hurt his hands, his knees were scraped as well; blood was seeping through his expensive pants. </p><p>\"It's done. Don't let it touch water for a couple of days. Keep an eye on it when you shower.\" Huo Mian reminded him. </p><p>\"Got it.\" </p><p>\"And… take off your pants.

She turned her head around and walked towards the fridge. </p><p>She opened the fridge to see it filled with vegetables and fruits. It seemed like he prepared them ahead of time. </p><p>Huo Mian took out some egg noodles and a bunch of lettuce. Then she walked to the kitchen. </p><p>- Twenty minutes later - </p><p>She brought a steaming bowl of egg noodles with lettuce out from the kitchen and set it on the coffee table. </p><p>\"Eat it while it's hot.\"</p><p>\"You're not going to have any?\" </p><p>\"I already ate during my shift. I'm not hungry.\" Then, Huo Mian turned around and went upstairs. </p><p>Qin Chu sat on the couch, grabbed the chopsticks, and slowly began eating the noodles. </p><p>Memories began surfacing in his mind... </p><p>\"Qin Chu, this shop's noodles are not good. How dare they charge 15 yuan for a yucky bowl of noodles? It's crazy. Next time, I'll make you some. I make good noodles.\" </p><p>\"Yeah? If one day we lose our jobs, you can open a noodle restaurant to support me.\" </p><p>\"Do you think I would let a man who lives off a woman be my husband?\" </p><p>\"As long as I can be your husband, I don't mind living off a woman.\" </p><p>They created a lot of beautiful memories seven years ago… </p><p>There was a lot of street food behind their school. Qin Chu loved noodles, so Huo Mian always went with him. </p><p>They visited many stores but found nothing good. That's how that conversation happened. </p><p>Back then, Qin Chu thought that he and Huo Mian would be with each other every day, so he would have many opportunities to try her noodles. </p><p>Little did he know that he had to wait seven years for that to happen. </p><p>Time was heartless. So many beautiful things could only be preserved in memories. </p><p>Although tonight he set his life aside to save her, she still kept him at arm's length. He knew what was on her mind. </p><p>He could see the conflict, unease, guilt, and fear in her heart. </p><p>But, as long as he could be with her, he was willing to sacrifice everything. His wish was very simple: as long as she was well.</p><p>His thoughts came to a halt. Qin Chu started to swallow down the noodles quickly and finished the soup. </p><p>He didn't remember how the noodles tasted, but he knew that these were the most delicious noodles in the entire world. </p><p>It was because Huo Mian cooked them… </p><p>- Upstairs in the bedroom - </p><p>Huo Mian lied on her bed, physically and mentally exhausted. Qin Chu got hurt because of her, she wasn't heartless and didn't overlook what happened. But, as soon as she thought of her mother's words, she immediately started to feel conflicted. </p><p>Ding~</p><p>She got a WeChat message… </p><p>Huo Mian slowly picked up her phone. As expected, it was from Zhu Lingling. </p><p>Recently she was on the east coast route and hadn't been back to C City. Huo Mian was actually not used to the tranquility without a boat load of messages from Lingling. </p><p>\"Mian, I'm back. Come out and have a drink with me.

Congratulations, you're finally with the man you love.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling had a touch of madness in her composition, but she knew Huo Mian best. Other than Qin Chu, there was no other man in her heart.</p><p>People like Ning Zhiyuan were rebounds that Huo Mian used to escape her feelings.</p><p>Zhu Lingling always felt like Ning Zhiyuan was not good enough for Huo Mian; indeed, he wasn't.</p><p>After all this time, Huo Mian got back together with Qin Chu.

Your mom and Qin Chu's parents will find out sooner than later; you guys won't be able to hide it for too long. Once you get pregnant or get stalked by the paparazzi, your marriage will go public. Qin Chu isn't a normal person, he's the prince of GK. He can't hide his marriage; it'll be exposed eventually. How do you plan to deal with it?\"</p><p>After some thought, Huo Mian replied, \"Lingling, to be honest, I don't plan on staying with Qin Chu. We're not meant to be together. So I think that after a while, I'll file for divorce.\"</p><p>\"Divorce? You're crazy, why would you want a divorce? I don't get it... You love him and he loves you. Why can't you guys just be together?\"</p><p>\"Lingling, so much has happened between the two of us. We can't go back. I don't know why Qin Chu wants to marry me, and I guess he's still salty about me breaking up with him seven years ago. Men are all the same, they always want what they can't get. Maybe he won't be like this anymore after he gets tired of me.\"</p><p>\"I don't think Qin Chu is like that. Mian, there's something that you might not know about. Qin Chu personally invited Ms. Yao back from New Zealand for our last reunion, and it was her who personally called you. It's clear how much he wanted to see you.\"</p><p>\"So what? Too much happened over the last seven years. Uncle Jing can't come back to life, and I don't want to anger my mom again. Anyways, I'll cut ties with him before our marriage is exposed.\"</p><p>\"Mian…\" Zhu Lingling had a feeling that Huo Mian was too mentally stressed.</p><p>She had only been married for a few days but was already thinking of divorce. If Qin Chu knew what she was thinking, wouldn't he be heartbroken?</p><p>Qin Chu's previous speculations were correct, she really was going to burn the bridge, wasn't she?</p><p>Their marriage was just a plan that went to her advantage, and Huo Mian knew that it was unfair to Qin Chu.</p><p>But was this world ever fair?</p><p>After WeChatting Zhu Lingling for a while, Huo Mian became drowsy and fell into deep sleep...</p><p>- Midnight -</p><p>Qin Chu silently entered and tucked Huo Mian in.

For as long as she could remember, he would always leave the house before seven.</p><p>Seeing him so early in the morning caused her to look away in awkwardness.</p><p>Especially because Huo Mian's face was unwashed, and her hair was messy.</p><p>\"You're not at work yet?\"</p><p>\"Mhm, there's not much to do today.\" Qin Chu sat at the dining table and was reading an economics newspaper.</p><p>On the table were two servings of breakfast...</p><p>They were western dishes again...</p><p>To be honest, Huo Mian was a little tired of western food...</p><p>But he made it out of good intentions, and if she didn't eat it, it would seem a bit insincere.</p><p>\"You… you seem to like western-style breakfast?\" Huo Mian slowly asked.</p><p>Qin Chu put down the newspaper, looked at her and replied, \"I don't know how to make Chinese food.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was speechless...</p><p>No wonder he always made western-style breakfast, and spaghetti and steak for dinner; he had no idea how to make Chinese food.</p><p>\"Ahem, I'll cook from now on.\"</p><p>\"No, I'll find a maid.\"</p><p>\"My food isn't horrible, trust me,\" Huo Mian explained.</p><p>\"I didn't marry you so that you can cook. I don't need my wife to do anything, just do whatever that makes you happy.\"</p><p>\"Uh…\" Huo Mian really wanted to tell Qin Chu that doing so would spoil her and make her arrogant. However, those words didn't seem appropriate as their relationship was a little weird.</p><p>\"Is your injury better?\"</p><p>\"Mhm.\"</p><p>\"Remember to keep it dry.\"</p><p>\"Mhm.\" Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>\"I'm done, I'm going to get ready for work.\"</p><p>\"I'll drive you.\"</p><p>Huo Mian stalled for twenty minutes, but when she came out, Qin Chu was still waiting for her.</p><p>He drove Huo Mian to the hospital in his low-key Volkswagen CC before going to the GK headquarters.</p><p>It was rush hour, and many employees saw their boss drive a Volkswagen CC with their own eyes.</p><p>At first, some people thought that the car belonged to Assistant Yang, but their jaws dropped when their boss came out of it.</p><p>Someone quietly muttered, \"What fashion trend is the president trying to pull? If my eyes are right, that's a Volkswagen CC, not some expensive luxury car.\"</p><p>Another replied, \"Maybe the president is planning to cooperate with Volkswagen. Are we manufacturing cars again?\"</p><p>\"I don't think so. Perhaps the president got tired of luxury cars and wanted to try something new. I think that's it.\"</p><p>\"Or maybe the president wants to give the car to one of the departments as a bonus?\"</p><p>The employees gossiped while Qin Chu went about his day...</p><p>- Inside the president's office -</p><p>Qin Chu was reviewing documents when Gao Ran called.</p><p>\"Did you find anything?\" He asked.</p><p>\"Of course, your bro is the captain of the criminal police squad, and I don't get paid for nothing. I found it, I found so much that it's scary.

He was there to kill Huo Mian.\"</p><p>\"Why would he kill Huo Mian?\" Gao Ran was surprised, how could a girl like Huo Mian have created enough hatred with someone to warrant a planned murder?</p><p>\"Let me investigate the rest.

He then handed a glass to Rick.</p><p>\"You must've called me for something important. What's up?\"</p><p>Rick asked with a smile as he swirled the glass in his hand.</p><p>He had known Qin Chu for many years. Even though they rarely contacted each other, they had a close relationship.</p><p>Friendships between men were different from that of women. Men would not get together for tea or afternoon shopping.</p><p>But when it was needed, they would always appear.</p><p>Rick's mother was a French aristocrat while his father was a local entrepreneur. Of course, his father was only an entrepreneur on the surface.</p><p>Their family owned a five-star hotel chain and the most luxurious club in the city – Seductive Fox.</p><p>In fact, Rick's family was technically a part of the mafia - a high-class mafia, that looked normal from the outside.</p><p>Qin Chu sat across from Rick and looked down at the glass of red wine in his hand. Then, he slowly said, \"Hongtai Logistics Company, Wang Li, male, 32 years old.\"</p><p>\"You want me to kill him?\" Rick asked, and a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Qin Chu shook his head…</p><p>\"Last night, he drove a truck outside of the city hospital and intentionally tried to hit someone. There must be someone behind him. I want you to help me find out who sent him.\"</p><p>\"What should I do after I find out? Kill them all?\"</p><p>\"That's not necessary. I will make them wish they were dead, and let them have a taste of their own medicine. Anyways, I don't want any loose ends.\"</p><p>Qin Chu was very worried about Huo Mian's safety. After pondering, he decided to ask Rick to solve the problem.</p><p>\"Okay, leave it to me.\"</p><p>\"Thank you.\" Qin Chu nodded thankfully when he saw how loyal Rick was to their brotherhood.</p><p>\"Don't thank me. You helped me resolve my older brother's issue back in the States. You can let me know whenever you need me,\" Rick said as he drank up all the red wine. He then got up and patted Qin Chu's shoulder.</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>\"Oh yeah, what did this guy do to you that you had to ask me to settle it?\" Rick was quite confused. Qin Chu could take care of a small problem like this in a matter of seconds, so why did he ask the violent mafia to intervene?</p><p>\"Because… they almost hurt the person I care about the most,\" Qin Chu answered slowly.</p><p>\"The person you care about the most? Oh, I get it, I see how it is. It seems like you two are back together now, congratulations.\" Rick smiled before turning around to leave.</p><p>Anyone who knew Qin Chu for many years would know that there was only one woman that Qin Chu cared about. </p><p>- First Hospital -</p><p>During Huo Mian's lunch break, while she was drinking water in the lounge, the terrifying scene from yesterday suddenly flashed before her eyes.</p><p>If Qin Chu had not pulled her away, she would be dead.</p><p>That huge truck was traveling very fast, even though there was a sign outside of the hospital that prohibited cars from speeding.</p><p>But that person still did. Was it as simple as drunk driving?</p><p>In the past, Huo Mian would not think too much about it. But after refusing to settle, the lawyer, Mr. Luo did threaten her a few days ago.</p><p>Huo Mian was worried; Mr. Luo's warning was already very clear.</p><p>Her ignoring what he said didn't mean that they wouldn't take actions against her.</p><p>It seemed like they had taken action...</p><p>Huo Mian's hand curled into a fist. She thought to herself, this society is so unfair.</p><p>They were in the wrong - it was their son who was driving drunk and hit the others. However, they refused to accept punishment and openly terrorized the family of one of the victims.</p><p>If she were run over yesterday, the traffic police would treat it as an ordinary traffic accident. Huo Mian would receive compensation of a few hundred thousand yuan, and the matter would be put to sleep.</p><p>At that thought, Huo Mian felt her a chill down her spine…</p><p>Then, her phone rang…</p><p>\"Where are you?\" Qin Chu's magnetic voice sounded over the phone.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":79,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:18.87","Link":"Chapter-79","NameDisplay":"Chapter 79"},{"ID":181120948193546092,"Name":"Chapter 80: Afternoon Tea","NameUnsign":"Chapter 80: Afternoon Tea","Description":"<p>Chapter 80: Afternoon Tea</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I'm at the hospital.\"</p><p>\"I'm outside the hospital, can you come out?\" </p><p>\"Do you need something?\" Huo Mian's tone was distant. She was very conflicted; she did not want to become too close to Qin Chu, but they lived under the same roof so it wasn't like she had a choice. </p><p>\"Yes,\" Qin Chu said with a serious tone. </p><p>Huo Mian looked at her watch, she had 20 minutes before she had to get back to work. There was still time. Thus, she stood up and walked towards the hospital entrance.</p><p>As soon as she got there, she saw Qin Chu, leaning against the unassuming Volkswagen CC. </p><p>Huo Mian hesitated for a moment before walking over slowly. </p><p>Qin Chu handed her a plastic bag, \"Here.\" </p><p>\"What's this?\" Huo Mian asked, a bit concerned. </p><p>\"Afternoon tea.\" </p><p>\"Thank you,\" Huo Mian said as she took over the bag and nodded in gratitude. </p><p>\"What did you need me for? Tell me quickly. I need to get back to work soon,\" Huo Mian asked. She didn't know why he made a special trip to the hospital at this hour. </p><p>\"I just wanted to give you your afternoon tea.\" </p><p>\"….\" Huo Mian was speechless.</p><p>That was it? He spoke so seriously that she thought he had something important to say.</p><p>Little did she know that for Qin Chu, everything related to her was important. </p><p>\"Alright, if that's everything, I'm going to head back in.\" </p><p>\"One second,\" Qin Chu said. </p><p>Huo Mian looked back at him… </p><p>Gently, Qin Chu used his hand to place her bangs behind her ears. </p><p>Huo Mian's face blushed almost instantly. </p><p>She looked like a girl who had just fallen in love… </p><p>\"Alright, go back to work. I can't pick you up after work today, some company business needs to be taken care of so I won't be home until later, but I will send someone to pick you up. They will give you a call then.\" </p><p>\"It's okay, I can take the bus since the hospital is so close to home.\" </p><p>No matter what she said, Qin Chu acted like he didn't hear anything and got into his car. </p><p>Huo Mian sighed and returned to the hospital with her afternoon tea. </p><p>- Inside the lounge - </p><p>She slowly opened the bag and saw a box of pink macarons, a box of puffs, a cup of coffee and a box of mixed fruits, with honeydew, watermelon, strawberries, and grapes. </p><p>It was beautifully packaged and the ingredients were all very fresh… </p><p>\"Wow, isn't this food from 37 Degrees? It's super expensive. I heard that a cup of coffee is 300 yuan. Huo Mian, you're so lavish. Tell me, did you win the lottery?\" Huang Yue exclaimed when she saw the packaging on the box. </p><p>\"No, this is a gift. I would never buy anything this lavish.\"</p><p>Huo Mian had heard of 37 Degrees. It was one of the most high-end coffee shops in the city and specialized in afternoon tea.</p><p>It was mostly frequented by socialites since ordinary people could not afford it. A cup of coffee was 300 yuan, and a serving of ice-cream was rumored to be 500 yuan. The prices were sky high. </p><p>The things Qin Chu bought must have cost at least 1000 yuan… </p><p>It was almost the same amount as her living expenses each month, yet Qin Chu bought her afternoon tea with that amount…</p><p>Huo Mian felt her heartache. </p><p>It might've been because she was used to being frugal after all these years. </p><p>\"A gift? Is someone trying to win your heart? Tell me, who is it?\" Huang Yue said with a mysterious smile. </p><p>\"No, it's a gift from my friend, the flight attendant. You know her.\" Huo Mian could only use Zhu Lingling as an excuse. </p><p>Then, she shared the food with the other nurses in her department. Everyone enjoyed it.</p><p>Just as she was about to get back to work, a male doctor knocked on the door and asked, \"Is Huo Mian here?\" </p><p>\"I'm Huo Mian,\" Huo Mian said as she wiped her mouth and got up.</p><p>\"Here, this is for you.\" The doctor suddenly took out a bouquet of roses, leaving her stunned. </p><p>But she didn't know this fellow at all…</p><p>Could someone tell her what was going on?</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":80,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:19.357","Link":"Chapter-80","NameDisplay":"Chapter 80"},{"ID":181120948198578219,"Name":"Chapter 81: Being Courted","NameUnsign":"Chapter 81: Being Courted","Description":"<p>Chapter 81: Being Courted</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Do we know each other?\" Huo Mian asked, confused.</p><p>The male doctor wore a pair of black frame glasses and looked quite shy… </p><p>\"You might not know me. Let me introduce myself, my name is Zhu Cheng. I am one of the doctors in the Ophthalmology Clinic. I've seen you many times when you visited our clinic. You were Dr. Ning's girlfriend, right? I heard that you guys broke up recently so I figured that my chance was here. I've liked you for a long time. You are so gentle, cute, and beautiful, not to mention you have a stunning figure. You are my type.\" </p><p>The male doctor rambled on for a while before handing over the bouquet of roses to Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian was stunned…. it seemed a little too soap opera-like? </p><p>The nurses behind her could barely contain their laughter… </p><p>Huo Mian looked at the roses and then back at Dr. Zhu and said, \"I'm sorry, but you're not my type.\" </p><p>\"What's your type? I can change.\" Dr. Zhu would not give up. </p><p>Huo Mian waved her hand and said, \"No no, you don't have to change. What's your type, I'll change to something else. Anyways, thank you. I can't accept the flowers.\" </p><p>\"Huo Mian, please consider what I said.\"</p><p>\"No, it's okay. I'm in a rush and need to get to work. I'm going to go now. Thank you.\" Then, without waiting for Dr. Zhu's response, Huo Mian rushed out the side door and hid in the OB/GYN clinic.</p><p>Dr. Zhu was clearly disappointed. He stood with his head hanging outside of the door. </p><p>Huang Yue walked up to him and said, \"Hey, Mr. Dork, stop thinking about Huo Mian. You're not her type. Go home and take a good look at yourself in the mirror. It's not your fault that you're ugly, but, it's wrong for you to come out and scare others.\"</p><p>Then, Huang Yue ran away in laughter.</p><p>Dr. Zhu was slightly stunned. After a while, he slowly walked away with the roses in his hand. </p><p>He had had a crush on Huo Mian for a long time. In the past, when he saw Huo Mian speaking to Ning Zhiyuan, he noticed that she had dimples when she smiled, giving him a warm feeling. When He Man told him that Huo Mian and Ning Zhiyuan had broken up, he decided to give it a shot and confess his feelings to her.</p><p>He never thought that she would not even give him a chance… </p><p>True, Dr. Zhu was a little ugly, but that was not the point. Even if it were an incredibly handsome man who stood before her today, she would still say no.</p><p>There was already a man who was deeply planted inside her heart since 7 years ago, and no one could replace him.</p><p>After Qin Chu gave Huo Mian her afternoon tea, he drove directly to the airport, since he had to catch a flight to another city. </p><p>His assistant did not understand what his boss was up to. President Qin had been working the entire morning, not even eating lunch before going out, and only arriving at the airport in time to board the plane. Assistant Yang felt like President Qin was always acting extremely mysteriously. </p><p>Maybe he has a mistress? Is it that woman from last time? Yang thought. </p><p>\"President Qin, this is the contract you'll be signing with the client during your meeting this afternoon. Here are the documents, you will be able to take a detailed look when you're on the plane.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>\"President Qin, you haven't had lunch. I wanted to order take-out for you but it's already too late. Why don't you have something to eat on the plane? I heard that the lunch on first-class is quite delicious.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Qin Chu nodded. He seemed to be in a good mood.</p><p>\"Did you book the return flight?\" </p><p>\"Um…not yet. The only return flight is after 12 AM and you won't land until 3 AM. I'm afraid that you won't be able to rest well, so I booked you a hotel. It'll be better if you fly back tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"That's not necessary. Cancel the hotel and book the 12 AM flight.\" </p><p>\"President Qin, that'll be too much of a rush. You will be very tired.\" </p><p>\"Book the flight.\" After speaking those three words, Qin Chu turned around and walked towards the VIP entrance. </p><p>Assistant Yang looked at his stubborn President speechlessly. </p><p>How attached was President Qin to his home that he was willing to fly back at midnight? From past observations, the president didn't seem to have a close relationship with his parents...</p><p>- First Hospital - </p><p>Just as Huo Mian got off work, she received a phone call from a person who said that Qin Chu had asked them to pick her up. </p><p>She did not know that Qin Chu had sent bodyguards because he was worried about her safety. </p><p>Even though it was only a short trip from the hospital back to their home, Qin Chu was still worried. </p><p>\"Miss Huo, this way please,\" said the two bodyguards dressed in black as they pointed to a Mercedes-Benz. </p><p>Huo Mian felt like they were making a scene... </p><p>When she arrived home, she washed her face. Just as she sat on the sofa to rest, she received a call from her mother. </p><p>\"Mom, what's the matter?\" Huo Mian asked nervously. She was scared that something had happened to her brother. </p><p>\"Go visit the Huo Family later,\" Yang Meirong said in a serious tone.</p><p>Huo Mian's chest sunk. The Huo family? The family without an ounce of affection or kindness?

He did not give them a single cent and acted as if they did not exist. </p><p>He did not even attend Uncle Jing's funeral, even though Uncle Jing was his chauffeur for ten years. </p><p>Such a heartless man did not deserve to be her father. </p><p>\"Go back, I heard that your grandmother passed away,\" Yang Meirong said with a hint of sadness in her tone. </p><p>If there were one good person in the Huo Family, it would be Granny Huo.</p><p>She was an old lady who practiced Buddhism, and she moved out of the Huo Family years ago to live in a temple in Southern China.</p><p>Huo Mian had met her once. A driver took Granny Huo to see her once, and she bought Huo Mian some pretty clothes and gave her money. </p><p>But her mother did not take the money. Those were all things that happened ten years ago when Huo Mian was only a teenager.</p><p>Huo Mian's heart sank when she heard that her grandmother was dead. It was an awful feeling.</p><p>\"You should go, just ignore the others. Your grandmother treated you quite well and visited you when you were young. You should go and see her one last time.\"</p><p>\"Alright.\" After a moment of hesitation, Huo Mian finally agreed.</p><p>She walked up to her closet to find something black to wear to the funeral. But she suddenly realized that she had moved, and none of her black clothes were here. She only had work clothes and the white tee and jeans she was wearing right now.</p><p>Worried, she opened the closet and was immediately stunned by all the clothes inside... </p><p>There were dozens of outfits, all brand new with their price tags still on them. They were all luxury-brand clothes, each worth more than four figures.</p><p>Dresses, jeans, t-shirts, cardigans, jackets, shawls, evening gowns, everything that she would ever need… </p><p>LV, Chanel, Versace, DG, Dior, Gucci, Prada, Valentino… </p><p>Did he move the stores into her closet? </p><p>Huo Mian randomly picked up a tag; she noticed that everything was size S, which was her size.</p><p>Had Qin Chu prepared all this for her? </p><p>But why didn't he say anything? This guy… </p><p>After the shock, Huo Mian chose a black dress from the closet. She put it on, and the dress looked exceptionally good on her.</p><p>She took a taxi and after 40 minutes, she arrived at the Huo Family's mansion which was located in the suburbs.</p><p>From a distance, she could see a lot of black cars parked outside the door. It seemed like everyone was there to grieve. </p><p>Huo Mian slowly walked over… </p><p>\"Excuse me, please show me your invitation.\" The security guard at the door stopped Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian had never been to this home, so naturally, the security guards did not know her. </p><p>\"I'm here to grieve for my grand--\" Huo Mian did not get the chance to finish her words when she saw a black Maserati pull up by her side. Then, the car window rolled down. </p><p>Huo Siqian said to the security guard, \"Let her through, she's my younger sister.\" </p><p>\"Yes, Young Master.\" </p><p>The security guard opened the door, and Huo Mian walked in… </p><p>After Huo Siqian parked his car, he caught up to her and said, \"I didn't expect you to come. I thought that the last thing you would do is come back to this home.\" </p><p>\"Of course I didn't want to come. I'm only here to send my grandmother off for the last time, and it has nothing to do with anyone else,\" Huo Mian said coldly. </p><p>\"Mian, you look beautiful today.\" After speaking, Huo Siqian did not wait for her response before heading towards the mourning hall. </p><p>\"Crazy.\" </p><p>Huo Mian looked at his figure and muttered, \"Today is a day to mourn and grieve, is it appropriate to praise one's looks?\"</p><p>Huo Mian always felt that Huo Siqian was quite odd, even though he was popular amongst women and well respected within the Huo Family. </p><p>Huo Mian also walked towards the mourning hall… everyone from the Huo Family was kneeling there… </p><p>Huo Zhenghai's wife, Jiang Hong, his mistress Shen Jiani, Huo Yanyan, and Huo Siyi were all present. </p><p>In the middle was her father, whom she had not seen in many years – Huo Zhenghai.</p><p>\"This is…?\" Huo Zhenghai looked at Huo Mian; he couldn't even recognize her. </p><p>\"Dad, this is Huo Mian,\" Huo Siqian introduced. </p><p>Huo Zhenghai was dazed at Huo Siqian's words... </p><p>He had called Yang Meirong and invited Huo Mian to come, but he didn't realize that this child had grown-up so quickly.</p><p>Everyone looked over when they heard Huo Mian's name.

Her mother is nothing, she's just a b*tch who ran away with dad's chauffeur.\" </p><p>Huo Mian only looked coldly at Huo Yanyan and said, \"Those who are well educated would never speak such vulgar words. It seems like the manners of a dignified daughter of the Huo Family is subpar.\" </p><p>\"Are you saying that I have no manners?\" Huo Yanyan was so angry she almost launched to her feet. </p><p>However, she was stopped by Shen Jiani, \"Yanyan, don't cause trouble, remember where you are at right now.\" </p><p>\"Since you are here, let's guard the mourning hall together. Quan, give her a piece of the filial cloth.\" Huo Zhenghai finally opened his mouth to speak. </p><p>\"Yes, Elder Master.\" </p><p>Then, the servant brought over a long, white filial cloth. Huo Mian took over the cloth and tied it to her head. </p><p>Then, she slowly kneeled down by the side of the mourning hall. </p><p>Her grandmother's portrait was in the center of the room. She looked amiable and kind. </p><p>Huo Mian felt sad, but not to the point of crying her eyes out. That would be too fake. </p><p>The members of the Huo Family would kneel for a while before taking a break. Huo Yanyan only kneeled for a moment before complaining of dizziness, and she was escorted back to the mansion. </p><p>Huo Siyi also escaped on the grounds of entertaining his friends. In the end, only Huo Mian and Huo Siqian were left in the mourning hall. </p><p>\"Mian, you should rest if you are tired. You don't need to keep kneeling here.\" </p><p>\"I'm not tired,\" Huo Mian said as she burned the joss paper in the basin. </p><p>\"It's almost time for dinner. You should go and wash your face.\" </p><p>\"I'm not hungry,\" Huo Mian refused once again. </p><p>Huo Siqian stared at her face silently. </p><p>After a long while, he said, \"If it weren't for grandmother's death, you wouldn't have entered this house again, right?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"You are so direct,\" Huo Siqian said with a curled smile. </p><p>Huo Mian did not speak; she only silently muttered words of blessing. </p><p>- 30 minutes later, at the dinner table - </p><p>Huo Zhenghai looked around but did not see Huo Mian, so he asked, \"Where is she?\" </p><p>\"She is still guarding the mourning hall. I asked Siqian to invite her to dinner but she said she wasn't hungry,\" Huo Zhenghai's wife, Jiang Hong, said. </p><p>\"Not hungry? I think she is just faking it to leave a good impression on dad. What a fake woman,\" Huo Yanyan interjected. </p><p>\"Yanyan, don't mutter nonsense.\" </p><p>\"Mom, I'm speaking the truth. My classmate said that people of ordinary backgrounds all seem innocent, but they scheme the most. They live at the bottom of society so they've seen so many ugly things. Dad, you shouldn't believe her…\" </p><p>Huo Zhenghai glanced at Huo Yanyan but did not speak… </p><p>\"I don't think Huo Mian is faking it. She doesn't need to suck up to dad. After all, he hasn't done much for her all these years. She seems to be used to it.\" </p><p>Huo Zhenghai's expression changed when he heard what Huo Siqian said. </p><p>It was true, he had forgotten that he had this daughter. If his mother did not ask him to invite Huo Mian to come back at her deathbed, he wouldn't have even contacted Yang Meirong… </p><p>\"Let's eat,\" Huo Zhenghai said after a moment of silence. </p><p>20 minutes later, everyone gradually gathered back in the mourning hall. </p><p>Jiang Hong said slowly, \"Zhenghai, the feng shui master said that someone needs to guard the mourning hall tonight. One person needs to stay here the entire night, and it would be best if it were a woman because a man's aura would interfere. Mother liked Yanyan before she passed, so maybe Yanyan should guard the mourning hall tonight?\" </p><p>Huo Yanyan's expression immediately changed. She said, \"Mother, I can't. I have low blood sugar so I am always dizzy. My mom contacted a doctor who is coming later to give me an IV drip. Why don't you ask my brothers to guard the mourning hall instead?\" </p><p>Guard the mourning hall alone? How could she do such a horrific thing? She was the princess of the Huo Family! </p><p>Shen Jiani hurriedly said, \"She's right, Elder Sister, Yanyan isn't feeling very well. Why don't I guard the mourning hall for her?\" </p><p>\"No, it must be a member of the younger generation.\" </p><p>\"Mom, let Huo Mian do it,\" Huo Siqian said. </p><p>Then, everyone looked towards Huo Mian. Huo Mian was listening to what they were saying. It was not a big deal for her since it was also her wish to send her grandmother off for the last time.</p><p>\"Are you going to be okay doing it alone?\" Jiang Hong asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":83,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:20.887","Link":"Chapter-83","NameDisplay":"Chapter 83"},{"ID":181120948214292090,"Name":"Chapter 84: Scheme","NameUnsign":"Chapter 84: Scheme","Description":"<p>Chapter 84: Scheme</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian nodded her head…</p><p>Huo Siqian smiled, \"See, I knew my little sister Mian is the most reliable one. When it really counts, a person's true colors will come out.\"</p><p>\"Big brother, what are you trying to say? It's not that I don't want to do it, I'm just not feeling well...\" Huo Yanyan tried to explain.</p><p>\"Alright, stop fighting. It's settled then.\" Huo Zhenghai gave Huo Mian a complicated look.</p><p>- After 9 PM -</p><p>Huo Mian was the only one left in the mourning hall. Several wreaths were placed on the sides of the coffin, within which her grandmother's body lied.</p><p>She was told that the funeral was tomorrow so she would have to stay for the night.</p><p>Huo Mian graduated from medical school and had worked in the hospital for so long, so she was accustomed to being around dead bodies.</p><p>Besides, it was her close relative's, so she wasn't scared at all.</p><p>Huo Yanyan is such a chicken… This family really can't be counted on.</p><p>She slightly bowed her head to burn some joss paper. Suddenly, she heard footsteps behind her.</p><p>\"You… Thank you for your work tonight.\"</p><p>That old and sophisticated voice was Huo Zhenghai's.</p><p>\"I did what I should have done,\" Huo Mian didn't turn her head around and answered in a plain tone.</p><p>\"I heard that you hadn't eaten all night. I asked someone to prepare some late-night snacks for you. They will be here soon.\"</p><p>\"I'm not hungry.\"</p><p>\"How… is your mother?\" Huo Zhenghai asked with slight hesitation.</p><p>\"Thanks to you, she's pretty good,\" Huo Mian said deliberately.</p><p>\"You two have the same temper and are both so strong-minded.\"</p><p>\"You are funny, President Huo. It's nice that we're self-reliant. After all, there's no one we can rely on forever, so relying on ourselves is the only way to go.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's words made Huo Zhenghai a little jittery.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, actually, back then…\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry. I have no interests in what happened between the two of you. If there's nothing else, please leave, President Huo. Didn't the feng shui practitioner say that only one person could stay?\"</p><p>\"Have you ever thought… about coming back?\"</p><p>\"I don't want to.\"</p><p>\"Do you know what you're giving up if you reject my proposal?\"</p><p>\"Some sort of right to an inheritance probably. I'm not interested. President Huo, you don't have to feel guilty. Grandma passed away now and I won't be coming back to this home anymore.\"</p><p>\"You...\" Huo Zhenghai didn't think that Huo Mian would refuse to come back to the Huo family, even after he invited her in person.</p><p>Siqian said that she currently worked in a hospital and was still an intern nurse. She must have led a hard life.</p><p>With one word, he could assign her to a high-level managerial position within the Huo Corporation, where she could earn a high salary without doing heavy work.</p><p>However, she still rejected him…</p><p>She really was just as stubborn and willful as her mother…</p><p>- Inside the Huo family's mansion -</p><p>\"Siqian, I see that you are really nice to that kid. Do you two talk to each other in private?\" Jiang Hong asked, looking at her son with a teacup in her hand.</p><p>\"No. I want to, but she doesn't seem to like me.\"</p><p>\"I can tell that you are very protective of her. Do you have any plans?\"</p><p>Huo Siqian walked behind Jiang Hong and began massaging her back, \"Mom, what do you think?\"</p><p>\"Are you thinking about helping her come back to the Huo family so she can be on our side, and we'll be able to get more shares of the family company?\" Jiang Hong knew her son well. Although he wasn't her biological son, she raised him since he was an infant. She knew he wasn't someone who would get the short end of a deal.</p><p>\"It is a good idea, but it's not going so well. That girl just doesn't want to come back. Maybe the shares would work on other people, but she doesn't even care about it. Besides, even though she's living an ordinary person's life, it doesn't mean that she's not happy with it.\"</p><p>\"Really? I can ask her. If you want, I will help you.\"</p><p>\"It's okay, mom, you can enjoy retirement. Let me handle this issue. I'm not worried about the other two idiots.\" Huo Siqian smiled slightly.</p><p>Qin Chu was supposed to take a midnight flight and arrive in the city by 3 AM, but he thought it would be too late. So, after he finished signing the contract, he drove to another city's airport and took a different flight to get back much earlier. It was only 11:50 PM when he got off the plane.</p><p>After he got off, he went straight to his home at Imperial Park. He thought Huo Mian would be asleep, but the house was empty when he opened the door. Then, he gave her a call.</p><p>Huo Mian answered her phone quietly. To let her grandma rest in peace, she put her cell phone on vibrate.</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>\"You're not at home?\" Qin Chu asked.</p><p>\"I'm at the Huo family,\" Huo Mian answered plainly.</p><p>Qin Chu frowned slightly. He knew very well about the relationship between Huo Mian and the Huo family. Didn't she find the idea of going back to their home repellant?</p><p>\"Grandma passed away. I am here to guard the mourning hall,\" Huo Mian explained when she didn't hear a response from Qin Chu.</p><p>\"My condolences,\" Qin Chu comforted.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"Are you there alone?\" Qin Chu asked, worrying because there were no other sounds in the background over the phone.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":84,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:21.43","Link":"Chapter-84","NameDisplay":"Chapter 84"},{"ID":181120948219354217,"Name":"Chapter 85: Company","NameUnsign":"Chapter 85: Company","Description":"<p>Chapter 85: Company</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Yes.\" Huo Mian answered honestly. </p><p>\"Are you scared?\" Qin Chu's voice suddenly became gentle, like he was amusing a child. </p><p>\"Why would I be? I went to medical school, so I'm fine around dead bodies. But when I think of grandma laying inside the coffin, I'm still a little sad.\" </p><p>\"Life and death are laws of nature. No one can do anything about it. Don't dwell on it.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" </p><p>After Huo Mian answered, she changed the topic, \"It's late. why are you still awake?\" </p><p>\"I just got back from a business trip.\" </p><p>\"This late?\" </p><p>\"Yeah.\" </p><p>\"You must be exhausted. Get some rest,\" Huo Mian said softly. </p><p>However, Qin Chu didn't have any intention of going to bed, \"Don't hang up the phone. I'll keep you company.\"</p><p>Afraid that Huo Mian would say no, he quickly added, \"I want to guard the mourning hall with you, just like this.\"</p><p>Faced with Qin Chu's good intentions, Huo Mian didn't have the heart to say no. She knew deep down what he was like.</p><p>Maybe she had been up for too long, but her eyes felt a little teary… </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>After a long silence, Huo Mian answered with one word. She then put down her phone, but it was still connected. </p><p>Yet, neither of them said anything else... </p><p>There was no doubt that this kind of company was the most special. Although it didn't have any physical meaning, Huo Mian didn't feel alone anymore on that sad night… </p><p>Huo Mian burned paper offerings for her grandma in silence without feeling sleepy even once, all the way until dawn. </p><p>The sun came up by 5 AM. </p><p>Huo Siqian walked over in a black shirt and suit pants, holding a vintage LV scarf. </p><p>He put the scarf on Huo Mian before she could say anything. </p><p>\"I don't need it.\" </p><p>\"Take it. It was grandma's when she was still alive. Unless you don't like it.\" </p><p>Hearing what Huo Siqian said, Huo Mian felt bad saying no. If she didn't accept, it would seem like she detested grandma's stuff. </p><p>Huo Siqian looked Huo Mian up and down and laughed, \"Mian, my little sister, the dress on you must be worth a fortune.\" </p><p>\"You're wrong. It's a fake.\" </p><p>\"Oh, really? I know your salary isn't very high as a nurse. Speaking of which, your job makes so little and is so tiring, have you ever thought about coming back to the Huo Corporation to help us?\" </p><p>\"Sorry, I am not interested in the Huo Corporation.\" </p><p>Huo Mian rejected assertively… </p><p>Huo Siqian seemed to have anticipated Huo Mian's answer. He just laughed, \"Ha, do you have something against money?\" </p><p>\"No, I have something against you.\" </p><p>Huo Siqian unfolded his hands innocently, \"Mian, my little sister, I have always been friendly to you. You shouldn't treat me like this.\" </p><p>Huo Mian didn't say anything. At that time, the feng shui master they hired arrived, \"The mourning has ended. You should go and get ready. We are leaving town at 7 AM for the burial.\" </p><p>Huo Mian stood up slowly, but she realized that her knees were asleep from kneeling. As soon as she stood up, she began to fall over.</p><p>Instinctively, Huo Siqian came up to lend an arm. But Huo Mian dodged it and fell to the ground. </p><p>\"Why would you do that? It's not like I will bite.\" Huo Siqian was a little speechless. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't respond. She slowly stood up while holding on to an iron rod by the funeral bed. Then she walked to the resting area, located beside the mourning hall. </p><p>Seeing how obstinate Huo Mian was, Huo Siqian's smile became deeper. </p><p>When Huo Mian found a quiet place and was ready to sit down, she suddenly remembered that her phone was still on. </p><p>She was still on the phone with Qin Chu. In that case… would he have heard the conversation she had with Huo Siqian? </p><p>She took out her phone to make sure. As expected, the phone call was still going…</p><p>She didn't know if Qin Chu was asleep or not, so she spoke quietly into the phone, \"Qin Chu, are you asleep?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":85,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:21.937","Link":"Chapter-85","NameDisplay":"Chapter 85"},{"ID":181120948224484707,"Name":"Chapter 86: The Funeral","NameUnsign":"Chapter 86: The Funeral","Description":"<p>Chapter 86: The Funeral</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Unexpectedly, on the other side, Qin Chu only said quietly, \"Stay away from that pervert Huo Siqian from now on.\" </p><p>\"…\" All of a sudden, Huo Mian didn't know what to say. </p><p>\"Did you hear me?\" Qin Chu warned her in a childish tone. </p><p>\"Yes, I know.\" </p><p>\"The funeral is at 7 AM right?\" A few minutes ago, through the phone, Qin Chu heard the feng shui master talking. </p><p>\"Yes.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>\"I will wait for you at the gates of the graveyard later.\" </p><p>\"It's fine. I'm just going to head to work at the hospital after this.\" </p><p>\"I already asked them to give you a day off. Come home and rest today.\" </p><p>\"Em…\" Huo Mian was again speechless. </p><p>This guy was fast. He had already asked the hospital to give her a day off. </p><p>But she was very curious. The clinic had been really busy recently, so why did the head nurse give her a day off so easily? </p><p>\"The head nurse… did she approve my day off?\" Huo Mian asked in disbelief. </p><p>However, Qin Chu answered casually, \"I called Wu Zhongxing.\" </p><p>\"Alright, you win.\" Huo Mian felt like all the blood in her body was going to coagulate after she heard that Qin Chu called Director Wu. </p><p>A nobody nurse intern from the OB/GYN Department called the hospital director to ask for a day off... It was a leap to death. </p><p>On the other hand, based on Qin Chu's social status, the director would probably even allow her to take an entire year off…</p><p>\"Okay then, see you later.\" After they finished talking, Qin Chu hung up the phone before Huo Mian could say anything else. </p><p>What a coincidence. After he hung up the phone, Huo Mian realized that her phone was dying. </p><p>Qin Chu kept her company on the other side of the phone without falling asleep for an entire six or seven hours. </p><p>He was persistent... </p><p>Sometimes, Huo Mian had an illusion that Qin Chu was still in love with her, even if he hadn't said so yet. </p><p>But it was only an illusion. Often, when she calmed down, Huo Mian would realize that they were both just unwilling to let go of the past.</p><p>He couldn't accept that he was dumped seven years ago. He couldn't accept that she broke up with him unilaterally. </p><p>The sky was dusky on the day of the funeral, and the wind was blowing hard. Huo Mian's heart felt very heavy. </p><p>There were about sixty people there, including the Huo family and their distant relatives. There were also over a hundred guests outside. Over a hundred black Mercedes-Benz followed each other in a grandiose fleet of cars; it was a spectacular scene. The car in the very front was a black Rolls Royce with grandma's portrait hanging on the front. </p><p>Everyone attending the funeral was wearing black, with white ribbons tied on one arm. </p><p>Reporters from several media sources followed the procession intently, making a scene. </p><p>Huo Mian wore a black dress and sunglasses, following the crowd as an inconspicuous existence. </p><p>Huo Siqian, Huo Siyi, Huo Yanyan, Mrs. Huo, and the mistress were on either side of Huo Zhenghai. </p><p>Of course, they were favored by the press… </p><p>Huo Yanyan's attitude had changed dramatically from the day before. Tears streamed from her red and puffy eyes, triggering sympathetic reactions.</p><p>The press gave her, specifically, a close-up, while a reporter commented on TV.</p><p>\"Huo Yanyan, the Huo family's princess, is leading the funeral procession, walking in the very front. Miss Huo looks extremely sorrowful, and her eyes are red and swollen. It is said that she stayed up all night yesterday in the mourning hall. The respect she paid to her grandmother has touched the whole world. Not only does Miss Huo have great looks, she also has a beautiful loving heart. What a precious woman. It's rare to see a kindhearted woman like her in the upper-class society. The Huo family has taught her well.\" </p><p>When this part was broadcasted on TV, Zhu Lingling was watching from an airplane and almost threw up… </p><p>She was close to Huo Mian, so of course she knew the Huo family's situation very well. </p><p>Several flight attendants were talking, \"Huo Yanyan is so nice. She's so pretty and kind. She must have been a big hero and saved the universe in her last life to be lucky enough to be born into the Huo family.\" </p><p>\"Bullshit, this woman is not as good as she seems to be. She's vicious. Don't believe what you hear in the press,\" Zhu Lingling said angrily. If there was anyone nice in the Huo family, it had to be Huo Mian. The rest were all hypocrites.</p><p>\"How do you know, Lingling? Are you good friends with Huo Yanyan?\" One of the flight attendants asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":86,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:22.45","Link":"Chapter-86","NameDisplay":"Chapter 86"},{"ID":181120948228986518,"Name":"Chapter 87: High-Key","NameUnsign":"Chapter 87: High-Key","Description":"<p>Chapter 87: High-Key</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"How can I possibly befriend a person like that? I would become so depressed,\" Zhu Lingling said with a hint of disdain. </p><p>The attendants of the funeral ceremony marched forward in streaming columns all the way to the North Hill Public Cemetery. Grandma Huo was to be buried in the best feng shui spot available – the peak of the mountain. </p><p>Supposedly, a space in this cemetery cost fifty thousand yuan per square meter.</p><p>It was terribly expensive, but the Huo family purchased two thousand square meters in one go – forging their very own, exclusive, mausoleum.  </p><p>On the side, Huo Mian stood silently with her sunglasses on. </p><p>Suddenly, Huo Siyi walked up to her and said, \"What are you looking at? Are you envious? This is the mausoleum that dad bought exclusively for the Huo family. Don't even think about being buried here, a bastard daughter like you would never be qualified.\"  </p><p>\"A place like this is better suited for you and your family, I don't belong here,\" Huo Mian said without glancing at Huo Siyi. </p><p>\"That's a given,\" Huo Siyi said arrogantly. </p><p>\"Well, best wishes to you being buried here soon,\" Huo Mian added.</p><p>\"What did you say?? You stupid girl!\" Huo Siyi raised his hand angrily at Huo Mian, seemingly wanting to hit her. </p><p>\"Mr. Huo, don't be so impulsive. The media is here waiting for scenes like this to increase viewership. But hey, if you want to be on the frontline news, go ahead and hit me. I will be sure to cooperate,\" Huo Mian lowered her voice and reminded him. </p><p>Huo Siyi dropped his arm by his side and looked around to ensure he didn't attract any unwanted media attention. \"You better watch yourself...\" he said resentfully before leaving. </p><p>Huo Siyi and Huo Yanyan are strikingly similar. They were both born from mistresses, and they had both been spoiled rotten. </p><p>Now that Huo Siyi was all grown up, the inheritance battle between him and Huo Siqian had become increasingly more intense. Thanks to his father's spoiling love and his mother's help, his pride has grown enough for him to start acting like the owner of the Huo family. </p><p>However, Huo Mian thought, a brainless idiot like Huo Siyi would be knocked out in seconds if Huo Siqian really wanted to deal with him. </p><p>The only reason why Huo Siqian hadn't made a move is merely due to that celebrity mom of Huo Siyi's that was difficult to deal with. </p><p>But then again, she wasn't at all interested in the Huo family's fight for inheritance.</p><p>None of this had anything to do with her, regardless of the result. </p><p>After the burial, all the vehicles started to make way back to the Huo mansion. Apparently, to show a token of appreciation to those who have shown condolences, Huo Zhenghai prepared a feast for sixty or so tables at a five-star hotel. </p><p>Huo Mian had already done what was required of her, so she surely wouldn't be going. Now that Grandma Huo had been buried, it was time for her to leave. </p><p>After both the media and the Huo family left, she began making way down to the entrance of the cemetery. </p><p>Rain began to pour as Huo Mian reached the entrance. While she was torn between running to the bus stop or the convenience store within the cemetery to buy an umbrella, A black 62S Maybach slowly pulled up beside her. </p><p>Supposedly, this car was worth more than 11 million yuan, straight out of Germany with the best configuration and parts. A lot of mainland millionaires were fighting to place an order, but due to the limited amount of quantities allowed for Asia, only six of this model were imported into China. </p><p>It was frontline news at the time, and a lot of nurses in the OB/GYN department were talking about it. </p><p>Thus upon seeing this car, Huo Mian took a second glance at it.</p><p>But wait… why does the person getting out of the car look so familiar? </p><p>Qin Chu wore a tailor-made black suit with a tender white flower pinned to his breast pocket. </p><p>He walked out of the Maybach, slowly propped open a black umbrella and walked towards Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Why…?\" Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu's outfit, not knowing what to say. She figured that he dressed like this out of respect for Grandma Huo. </p><p>\"Were you planning to run through the rain if I didn't come and get you?\" Qin Chu asked Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Well, you are here, aren't you?\" Huo Mian said slowly. </p><p>\"C'mon, Get into the car,\" said Qin Chu as he took out a white handkerchief and wiped away some of the raindrops on Huo Mian's forehead.</p><p>Huo Mian sat in the Maybach made for royalty and looked at this amazingly handsome man who was now her driver. </p><p>In a moment of bewilderment, she thought, it was not Huo Yanyan who had saved the universe in the last life. It was in fact, herself. </p><p>\"Qin Chu, um… your car… isn't it a little too flamboyant?\" Huo Mian asked, unable to hold back any longer.</p><p>The very first Maybach with Royal Class level configuration in C City! It will surely attract loads of attention when they drive around the city.

Later, her family went bankrupt, leaving her no choice but to brave the world in poverty with her husband.</p><p>Grandpa Huo started from scratch and built his little manufacturing factory. He became overwhelmingly busy, and left Grandma Huo alone with her arts and crafts.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, before Huo Mian was even born, Grandpa Huo passed away from lung cancer.</p><p>Grandma Huo then moved out of the house and frequently resided within the temple. When asked, she simply said that she was praying for Grandpa Huo.</p><p>In the end, she was nothing more than a woman infatuated by love.</p><p>Huo Mian only saw Grandma Huo a handful of times. Nevertheless, to this day, she remembered the familial bond between them.</p><p>She dreamt that she had slowly wandered over and rested her head on Grandma Huo's lap and fell asleep.</p><p>The sunlight that shined through the temple surrounded her, and Huo Mian felt a sense of happiness that she could not explain with words.</p><p>When she woke up, Huo Mian found a white blanket on her. The quilt was made with bamboo charcoal fiber, so it felt soft and silky on her skin.</p><p>Other than Qin Chu, she couldn't possibly think of a second person who would do this.</p><p>She checked her fully charged phone and realized that it was already half past eleven. She slept for more than three hours?</p><p>Huo Mian felt a little hungry. She yawned and went to the sauna room on the second floor.</p><p>On the second floor, there was a Korean-style shared sauna room that allowed for showers and saunas.</p><p>Huo Mian never really used it before. She felt like it was too inconvenient since she shared this room with Qin Chu.</p><p>But Qin Chu wasn't here today; she was home alone. It would be a good idea to relax a little in the sauna room.</p><p>However, it wasn't until she finished showering that she realized she forgot to bring in a towel.</p><p>Out of necessity, Huo Mian grabbed two tiny towels from the sauna room. She covered up the most important parts of her body and carefully walked out.</p><p>She followed the hallway that leads to the bedroom, but then the door of the study magically swung open.</p><p>Huo Mian was dumbfounded upon seeing Qin Chu.</p><p>Huo Mian attempted to clutch the tiny towels tighter, but out of nervousness, she lost her grip.</p><p>Both towels fell to the floor…</p><p>\"Ah…\" Huo Mian shrieked. Not knowing what to do, her hands flew up to cover her face.</p><p>Why? Because she once heard a joke about a public shower place that caught on fire. A lot of women ran out, some covering the top half of their bodies, while the others covered the bottom half. One particular woman walked out calmly with her face covered. \"This way, no one will know who I am,\" the woman said proudly. </p><p>Therefore, Huo Mian automatically covered her face.</p><p>Qin Chu was stunned by her reaction.</p><p>He looked at her exposed body and felt his throat tighten. Qin Chu tried hard to control the urges deep within in his heart.</p><p>\"There's only the two of us, is it really necessary to cover your face?\" Qin Chu asked as a hint of awkwardness floated in the air.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":88,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:23.433","Link":"Chapter-88","NameDisplay":"Chapter 88"},{"ID":18112094823904771,"Name":"Chapter 89: Pervert","NameUnsign":"Chapter 89: Pervert","Description":"<p>Chapter 89: Pervert</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Hurry up and get out of here.\" Huo Mian panicked when she peeked through her fingers and noticed that Qin Chu had no intention of leaving.</p><p>\"You are walking around the hallway naked in broad daylight... are you sure you are not trying to seduce me?\" Qin Chu chuckled slightly and never for a second moved his eyes away from her body.</p><p>\"I didn't know you were home. Who knew you would be home at this hour! Don't you have to work?\" Huo Mian said angrily as she pointed at Qin Chu. Her face glowed with fury.</p><p>Qin Chu remained silent as his eyes followed her plump curves up and down.</p><p>\"You pervert!\"</p><p>Huo Mian felt like she had been completely exposed. She pushed Qin Chu away and ran towards the bedroom. </p><p>\"C'mon Mrs. Qin. I am legally your husband, okay?\" Qin Chu couldn't help but mutter to himself in the hallway.</p><p>- In the bedroom -</p><p>Huo Mian refused to leave the bedroom after she changed.</p><p>She had no idea how to face Qin Chu anymore, it was way too embarrassing...</p><p>Also, how dumb was she to listen to that stupid joke and attempt to cover her face?</p><p>There were only two people in the house, and in an attempt to cover her face, her body had been exposed completely. Not to mention that Qin Chu pointed out the flawed logic of covering her face.</p><p>If Zhu Lingling ever found out about this, she would surely question her status as a genius with an IQ of 130.</p><p>She felt like her brain forgot how to function properly over the last seven years...</p><p>Most importantly, Huo Mian thought Qin Chu was at work.</p><p>Shouldn't the president of GK be super busy? Why the heck was he chilling at home in broad daylight?</p><p>Plus, it wasn't even the weekend yet...</p><p>Can someone tell her what was going on?</p><p>Truth be told, Qin Chu was supposed to go to work today, but he was worried that Huo Mian would wake up with nothing to eat.</p><p>So, he decided to work from home via telecommunications. He had just cleaned out his email inbox when he noticed that it was almost noon.</p><p>He thought Huo Mian would wake up soon and therefore walked out of the study.</p><p>He had no idea that he would be able to witness such an interesting scene.</p><p>It was true that they slept together once seven years ago, but it wasn't exactly a great experience, because they were both young and naïve.</p><p>They were both adults now and had been married for several days. Yet, they had not slept in the same bed once.</p><p>Now that this had happened, it was much more awkward, for Huo Mian of course.</p><p>However, Qin Chu thought whatever happened was a good thing. It wasn't until today that he found out how curvy Huo Mian was.</p><p>He never thought that the thin and bare-looking Huo Mian would have curves in all the right places.</p><p>For a moment, he wanted to charge over and have her beg for mercy under him.</p><p>But he knew that it wasn't the time, and doing so would frighten her.</p><p>Qin Chu waited in the living room for a while but Huo Mian still didn't come out. He figured that she probably felt embarrassed.</p><p>\"Hey, are you going to hide in the bedroom forever?\" He went upstairs and knocked on her bedroom door.</p><p>\"Go away! I will come out as soon as you leave.\"</p><p>\"Me leaving doesn't change the fact that I saw everything,\" Qin Chu smirked.</p><p>\"Stop talking.\" Huo Mian covered her burning face.</p><p>\"So, are you not planning to have lunch with me then?\"</p><p>\"Don't you have to go to work today?\" Huo Mian asked behind the door.</p><p>\"I'm staying home all day today, so there's no point in hiding.\"</p><p>\"Why are you such a crook!\" Huo Mian said angrily.</p><p>\"I'd be a crook if I were to hide a camera in the shower, don't you think?\" Qin Chu said slowly.</p><p>Huo Mian was left speechless.</p><p>\"C'mon, let's go eat.\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Fine, if you are going to keep being stubborn like this, I will call Wu Zhongxing and tell him my wife will no longer be going back to work, and that you plan on hiding in the bedroom forever,\" Qin Chu said as he pretended to leave. </p><p>\"Stop! How dare you interfere with my job!\" Sure enough, Huo Mian immediately opened the door.</p><p>\"Good thing you came out. C'mon, let's go eat. I'm starving,\" said Qin Chu as he began heading down the stairs.</p><p>Huo Mian wore a set of beige sportswear, her wet hair sitting loosely on her shoulders.</p><p>Her getup made her look much younger, almost like a high school student.</p><p>- Inside the Maybach - </p><p>Qin Chu stared at her for a couple of seconds; his eyes showed a slight tenderness that was difficult to capture.</p><p>\"What are you looking at? You've never seen a pretty girl before?\" Huo Mian said as she looked away and intentionally avoided eye contact with Qin Chu.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":89,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:23.907","Link":"Chapter-89","NameDisplay":"Chapter 89"},{"ID":181120948244151261,"Name":"Chapter 90: Habit","NameUnsign":"Chapter 90: Habit","Description":"<p>Chapter 90: Habit</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Yes, I've definitely never seen a pretty girl who would only cover her face when she's naked,\" Qin Chu smirked and answered slowly.</p><p>\"Hey…\" Huo Mian walked right into his trap. She was so embarrassed that she wished the ground would just swallow her up.</p><p>\"I'm leaving the car if you don't quit it,\" Huo Mian said as she tried to open the door.</p><p>\"Settle down.\" Qin Chu gripped her arm.</p><p>Huo Mian felt the warmth of his palm underneath her clothes. She couldn't stop her heart from beginning to race.</p><p>Qin Chu loosened his grip and returned his hand onto the steering wheel. None of them spoke another word throughout the drive. </p><p>- Thirty-minutes later -</p><p>The car parked by a street filled with food behind Second High School.</p><p>Memories rushed towards Huo Mian as the sight of her old high school filled her eyes.</p><p>\"I heard this land had been bought.\" </p><p>\"Oh yeah? When?\" Qin Chu asked, unconcerned.</p><p>\"Probably sometime this year? There were lots of demolishment signs here last year, and I heard the school will be moved to the suburbs.\"</p><p>\"I heard differently. I heard that no one will be touching this land anymore.\"</p><p>\"Really?\" Huo Mian asked in disbelief and looked at Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Yeah, apparently there's no business value, so no one wanted it,\" said Qin Chu as he turned and walked into a noodle house.</p><p>- Ah-Xin's Ramen -</p><p>The noodle house was called Ah-Xin's Ramen. The owner of the place was from Taiwan, and he was roughly forty years old. His name was, of course, Ah-Xin. </p><p>His wife was a local of the city, so he followed her and moved here twenty years ago. They had a son and a daughter and were very content with their lives.</p><p>Qin Chu and Huo Mian used to come here a lot back when they were in high school.</p><p>Huo Mian came here because this place was tasty and cheap. </p><p>A large bowl of ramen only cost two yuan. It was delicious, even though it only had green onions in it.</p><p>Initially, Qin Chu was very reluctant to try street food, but he couldn't resist Huo Mian's invitations and began eating it as well.</p><p>Habits can sometimes be very frightening. It can be difficult to change something once you are used to it.</p><p>Huo Mian stared at the noodle house. Everything looked the same as it did seven years ago. For a moment, she felt like she had been transported back in time.</p><p>Huo Mian never came back here after she and Qin Chu broke up. She was afraid that the place would tug at her heartstrings and bring up old memories.</p><p>She would have never thought that Qin Chu would take her here today.</p><p>\"Sir, two bowls of ramen,\" said Qin Chu.</p><p>\"No problem!\" The noodle shop's owner replied enthusiastically as he began boiling some noodles. </p><p>\"Why are you still standing there? Come here,\" said Qin Chu as he noticed that Huo Mian was spacing out by the front door.</p><p>As if pulled back into reality from a long dream, Huo Mian slowly sat down. </p><p>\"Sir, how much is a bowl of ramen now?\" asked Huo Mian curiously.</p><p>It should be at least ten yuan now, given how inflation had been going.</p><p>But, the owner only chuckled and said, \"The same as it used to be.\"</p><p>\"Two yuan?\" Huo Mian asked, astonished. </p><p>\"Yup.\"</p><p>\"Aren't you losing money with today's high costs?\" Huo Mian doubted.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say I am losing money per se, but I am definitely earning very little now.\" The boss wiped a bead of sweat off his forehead and chuckled.</p><p>\"So why don't you raise the price? It's not like anyone will object.\"</p><p>\"Because I wouldn't want to destroy people's memories. A lot of the high school kids would come back every year to reminiscence. Sometimes, I feel like I'm not just selling ramen noodles, I'm selling the memories of those that were once here.\" </p><p>\"Sir, you shouldn't be selling ramen, you should go and be a writer. You are a carbon copy of Yu Qiuyu,\" Huo Mian chuckled.</p><p>\"Nah, I don't have much education, so I don't understand no literature. But my wife did say that happiness cannot be bought with money. I find meaning when you kids eat here and tell me that it makes you guys happy. So, I try not to think about money. As long as I have enough, it's fine. Sometimes having too much money can be burdensome.\"</p><p>\"Not many think like that; it's rare for people to hold your perspective,\" Qin Chu glanced at Ah-Xin and said.</p><p>The owner only chuckled and said nothing more.</p><p>After a couple of moments, two bowls of steaming hot ramen noodles were served. </p><p>With much anticipation, Huo Mian took a bite. It was just like seven years ago.</p><p>\"It's so delicious,\" Huo Mian said.</p><p>\"Eat more if you like it.\" Qin Chu's heart skipped a beat as he watched Huo Mian's face fill with content.</p><p>\"Sir, bill please!\" Huo Mian took the initiative and waved her hand after they finished.</p><p>\"Don't worry about it, Qin Chu prepaid quite a lot of money.\" The boss chuckled.</p><p>\"You prepaid? When?\" Huo Mian asked, slightly surprised.</p><p>\"Seven years ago.\"</p><p>\"How much did you pay…?\" Huo Mian glanced at Qin Chu in disbelief, as if she were looking at an alien.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":90,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:24.417","Link":"Chapter-90","NameDisplay":"Chapter 90"},{"ID":181120948249395340,"Name":"Chapter 91: Weirdo","NameUnsign":"Chapter 91: Weirdo","Description":"<p>Chapter 91: Weirdo</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Seventy-three thousand yuan.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's mouth dropped wide open after she heard his answer.</p><p>\"A bowl of noodles is two yuan, if we eat one bowl a day it will be four yuan for two people. In one year that's one thousand four hundred and sixty yuan. It will be seventy-three thousand in fifty years,\" Qin Chu immediately said afterward.</p><p>\"So, you basically deposited enough money to buy noodles for the next fifty years,\" Huo Mian said, bewildered.</p><p>\"I want to eat ramen with you my whole life. That's all,\" Qin Chu looked Huo Mian in the eye and said.</p><p>Then, the noodle shop's owner interrupted, \"I promised this kid that I would get my kids to inherit this noodle house if I ever become too old to make them. We will make sure the tab is kept clear.\"</p><p>\"That's not what I mean Ah-Xin, I just think… this is so bizarre,\" Huo Mian explained.</p><p>\"Not to me,\" Qin Chu said innocently.</p><p>\"Okay, never mind.\"</p><p>Huo Mian still couldn't get over what happened as they were leaving the noodle house. </p><p>If a man was willing to eat ramen with you his whole life, doesn't it also mean that he wants to spend the rest of his life with you?</p><p>Does it?</p><p>Could she and Qin Chu be like this…their entire lives?</p><p>She didn't dare think or dream about it...</p><p>\"You look like you are concentrating really hard on something… you must be contemplating things related to me.\" Qin Chu glanced at Huo Mian, who looked absent-minded.</p><p>\"Could you be any more self-absorbed, President Qin?\" Huo Mian rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>\"Am I wrong?\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>\"You know, I can't believe the noodle house stayed exactly the same. I can't imagine how they did it, not changing the price for seven years. Ah-Xin is such a nice business owner,\" Huo Mian said in an attempt to change the subject and cover up the fact that Qin Chu was, in fact, correct.</p><p>\"I see that you are trying to change the subject. So was I right then?\"</p><p>\"You are unbelievable...\" said Huo Mian. She felt a little speechless.</p><p>\"You're not a belly worm in my stomach, even twins can't guess what the other person is thinking,\" Huo Mian said. She then turned her head away from him in an attempt to disengage from the further conversation.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't say a word. He simply smirked quietly.</p><p>Qin Chu drove the car to First Hospital. Huo Mian bought some take out for Zhixin as dinner.</p><p>Jing Zhixin recovered very well after the surgery. His mom would come and take care of him during the day, and a caretaker Huo Mian hired came during the night.</p><p>This way, Jing Zhixin was taken care of at all times.</p><p>Huo Mian chatted with Zhixin a little and noticed that it was getting late. She was contemplating whether she should stay over at the hospital since she had to work the next day.</p><p>Zhu Lingling's phone call came in just then. She invited her out for dinner.</p><p>- At a Thai restaurant in the downtown district of C City -</p><p>Zhu Lingling looked beautiful in her flaming red dress. Huo Mian still wore the same black dress that she wore for the funeral.</p><p>\"Mian, here.\" </p><p>\"You're here early.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"There might not be any seats left if I didn't come early. The pineapple rice here is delicious, you should try it.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian smiled and slid into her seat gracefully.</p><p>\"Hey, that is a Versace dress! Qin Chu is so generous!\" As an airline stewardess, Zhu Lingling sometimes worked as a private purchasing agent, so she was familiar with luxury goods. </p><p>\"That's not the point, alright? The point is I just came from Grandma Huo's funeral. That's why I'm wearing a black dress.\"</p><p>\"Oh yes, tell me about the family! Was that super-rich dad of yours surprised to see you? Did you see Prince Huo? Was he a handsome gentleman? Was Huo Yanyan still as annoying as she used to be?\" Zhu Lingling was immediately in gossip mode.</p><p>\"Huo Siqian? Handsome? Gentleman?\" </p><p>Those words couldn't possibly be associated with him, Huo Mian thought.</p><p>\"You've asked so many questions, I don't even know which to answer first.\" Huo Mian took a sip of her tea.</p><p>\"Okay, I will ask one question at a time then. Have you and Qin Chu done it yet?\"</p><p>Huo Mian almost spat out her tea in utter surprise.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":91,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:24.94","Link":"Chapter-91","NameDisplay":"Chapter 91"},{"ID":181120948254125515,"Name":"Chapter 92: Blessing","NameUnsign":"Chapter 92: Blessing","Description":"<p>Chapter 92: Blessing</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"What kind of reaction is that?

So, what the heck was the point of getting married?\" Zhu Lingling asked with slight disdain.</p><p>\"Just because we are married doesn't mean we have to sleep together. You already know that I only agreed to marry him so Zhixin could get the surgery.\"</p><p>\"But you guys are husband and wife now, and that's a fact.\"</p><p>Huo Mian replied with silence, as a melancholic look appeared on her face.</p><p>Huo Mian had no idea that things would turn out the way they did. She no longer had any idea of how she and Qin Chu would get along from now on.</p><p>\"Okay, I will stop talking about this depressing topic. This is my new boyfriend, what do you think?\" Zhu Lingling pulled out her phone and showed Huo Mian a photo of her standing intimately next to a man.</p><p>\"Will this one last more than three months?\" Huo Mian asked with a worried look on her face.</p><p>\"This one is rich and talented. I don't think there will be a problem. Ha! This guy is a smart businessman, and I'm going for the long-run this time. It's for real this time, girl!\"</p><p>While Huo Mian listened to Zhu Lingling's sincere and serious promise, she still felt a little skeptical about the whole situation.</p><p>\"You say you are 'for real' every time, but it never lasts for more than three months.\"</p><p>\"Not my fault that none of my relationships were true love.\" Zhu Lingling rested her chin on her palms and smiled.</p><p>\"Fine. Have you ordered food yet? I'm starving.\" Huo Mian smiled back.</p><p>\"Yup, you are treating today! You've married rich! I must rip you off a little!\" Zhu Lingling stuck out her tongue playfully. </p><p>\"It's on me, no problem.\" Huo Mian patted her chest reassuringly.</p><p>\"Whoa! Must be nice to be rich! Here, boss, a toast to you. Congratulations on your marriage.\"</p><p>\"Let's change the blessing, this one is no good,\" Huo Mian said indecisively.</p><p>\"Who cares. Let me tell you something, Mian. We only live for so long, don't be so hesitant all the time. Don't dread the past, fear the future, and end up accomplishing absolutely nothing in the end. Don't wait until you are old, and then regret the choices that you didn't make. If you ask me, your relationship with Qin Chu is a simple one. You love him, and he loves you. So, be together, and deal with the rest later. \"</p><p>Huo Mian smiled bitterly.</p><p>\"Lingling, things are not as easy as you crack them up to be. Sometimes it's difficult for you to try to walk a mile in my shoes. It can be hard for you to understand what I'm going through. But it's fine, let's not talk about this. We barely have time to have dinner together anymore, so let's just enjoy ourselves.\"</p><p>The two women raised their glasses and toasted.</p><p>The meal cost 700 yuan, so it was a little luxurious indeed.</p><p>But as soon as Huo Mian paid for the bill, Zhu Lingling stuffed a big red envelope into her hands.</p><p>\"What is this?\" Huo Mian asked in disbelief.</p><p>\"Your wedding gift.\"</p><p>\"Dude, I didn't even have a wedding.\" Huo Mian didn't know whether she should laugh or cry.</p><p>\"Yes, but you guys are married on paper. It's common courtesy.\"</p><p>\"Fine, you win.\" Huo Mian willingly accepted Zhu Lingling's red envelope.</p><p>Just by the look of it, there were at least five thousand yuan in there. If there was anything that made Huo Mian feel happy these past years, it was the fact that she had Zhu Lingling as her best friend.</p><p>She was always by her side whenever Huo Mian needed help.</p><p>Huo Mian used to think that perhaps friendship would last longer than love.</p><p>After dinner with Zhu Lingling, Huo Mian took a taxi back to Imperial Park.</p><p>Her phone started ringing right as she was about to get off the taxi.</p><p>\"Ms. Huo, I'm Mr. Luo, the Lawyer.\"</p><p>\"What do you want?\" Huo Mian's face turned dark as soon as she heard the voice on the other line.</p><p>\"Ms. Huo, I'm calling you to tell you that you no longer need to go through the trouble of suing anymore.\"</p><p>\"Are you trying to settle with me again?\" Huo Mian laughed coldly.</p><p>\"No, something happened to my client.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Huo Mian couldn't believe her ears as she asked again.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":92,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:25.413","Link":"Chapter-92","NameDisplay":"Chapter 92"},{"ID":181120948259479593,"Name":"Chapter 93: Influential Figures","NameUnsign":"Chapter 93: Influential Figures","Description":"<p>Chapter 93: Influential Figures</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Mr. Luo, can you clarify? I'm not sure I understand what you mean.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was not sure what to believe. After all, this was the same person who had been super arrogant and overbearing only a few days ago. What happened to the connections he had bragged about? What about the client's relatives, who were supposedly influential figures in politics?</p><p>\"Something happened at my client's family two nights ago. He was taken in for questioning under suspected corruption charges, and the Ministry of Transportation also stated that they would closely investigate the serial car crash incident that happened on the university campus. If he is found guilty, my client Lu Yigang will be sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison.\"</p><p>\"Woah, that's great. That just goes to show that you can't hide from the law forever.\" Huo Mian smirked.</p><p>Wow, Karma sure acts fast, she thought.</p><p>\"But I'm still very confused. Isn't it too much of a coincidence that the Ministry of Transportation launched an investigation at the same time my client was arrested? The press wasn't even conducting any follow-up reports.\"</p><p>\"What are you trying to say?\" Huo Mian could tell that he was trying to hint something.</p><p>\"Well, haha… please forgive me for anything I did that might have offended you in the past. Miss Huo, you clearly have the support of some influential figures, seeing that you have the ability to alert both the Ministries of Transportation and Finance in such short notice. Such power is truly terrifying, so I am calling today to apologize for any inconveniences I may have caused you. If you don't mind, I'd like to show my sincerity by treating you to a meal.\"</p><p>\"I think I understand what you're trying to say, but I'll pass on the meal. There's no need for me to sue any longer as the accused has already been arrested. However, I don't know what you mean by 'influential figures'.\"</p><p>\"Some things are better left unsaid, but anyways… Miss Huo, you are a lucky person and are one that I cannot cross. Please be so kind as to overlook my previous offenses.\"</p><p>After hanging up, Huo Mian came to a suspicious realization…</p><p>The only person she mentioned this issue to was Qin Chu. Did he help her out?</p><p>Wasn't it too much of a coincidence for the car crash and the arrest to happen simultaneously?</p><p>She found it hard to believe that such luck was due to an act of God.</p><p>With her head full of heavy thoughts, Huo Mian returned to Imperial Park.</p><p>Qin Chu was working over time, so Huo Mian was home alone, and her OCD was triggered.</p><p>After mopping the entire living room floor, her forehead was covered in sweat.</p><p>Just as she was getting ready to go shower, she heard the sound of key jingling in the front door.</p><p>Slowly, she began to get nervous. Weird, since it's not like it could be anyone other than Qin Chu.</p><p>Even so, she became unexplainably nervous.</p><p>\"You didn't need to work the night shift today?\"</p><p>She wasn't sure when it started, but at some point, he began to know her schedule better than she did herself.</p><p>\"No, I came home after having dinner with Lingling.\"</p><p>Qin Chu nodded silently, seemingly exhausted, and walked upstairs after removing his coat.</p><p>\"Have you eaten yet?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\" Qin Chu paused and turned back to reply to Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Oh,\" Huo Mian replied distractedly.</p><p>\"Did you have something to say to me?\"</p><p> Qin Chu probed her after noticing that she had something on her mind.</p><p>\"Yeah...\"</p><p>\"Okay, go ahead.\" Qin Chu turned around and walked back downstairs, sitting down on the sofa.</p><p>\"Do you know… who caused my brother's accident?\" Huo Mian cautiously asked while taking note of Qin Chu's facial expressions.</p><p>\"Mian, don't beat around the bushes, just ask me whatever it is you want to ask.

She took a deep breath, walked over and said, \"Alright, if this is the case, I will put it out there. The culprit who hit my brother had something going on in his family. You probably didn't know that I was going to sue them, but the lawyer said there's no need anymore. The culprit was taken away by the Ministry of Transportation. His high-profile parents were detained and are being investigated by the Ministry of Finance. I don't need to sue anymore.\" </p><p>\"So?\" Qin Chu asked, looking at Huo Mian intently. </p><p>\"I don't believe this was a coincidence or karma. I think someone had their hands behind all this. I can't think of anyone other than you.\" </p><p>\"If you already made up your mind and think it was me, then why bother asking? Don't you already have your answer?\" </p><p>\"I just want to hear you say it.\" Huo Mian was getting a little emotional. </p><p>\"Yes, I asked someone to do it. Isn't it better this way? Otherwise, you wouldn't win the case. Do you know how ridiculous you are?\" With his head down, Qin Chu took a lighter out from his pocket and fiddled with it in his hands. </p><p>\"I know it's ridiculous and I know you did this for my own good. But Mr. Qin Chu, in the future would you please give me a heads-up before you do nice things for me? I prepared all the materials for the lawsuit like an idiot.\" </p><p>Qin Chu slowly lifted his head and glared at Huo Mian, \"I thought you would be happy that I did this.\" </p><p>\"You didn't do anything wrong. Those people deserved it, but I have the right to know what's going on. I don't want to be like an ignorant child, and you don't need to pretend to be my savior, okay? You can't save me. You couldn't save me seven years ago, and you can't now either.\" After she finished talking and before Qin Chu could say anything, Huo Mian turned around and went upstairs, leaving him no chance to open his mouth and respond. </p><p>Looking at that delicate figure from behind, Qin Chu's eyes filled with loneliness… </p><p>Then he thought aloud to himself, \"Mian, I just thought, if the world lacks justice, I will become the justice you need.\" </p><p>Unfortunately, Huo Mian didn't hear this…</p><p>In fact, the relationship between two people can be very complicated. People have different personalities, and therefore misunderstandings occur frequently.  </p><p>There are some words that if left unsaid, one wouldn't understand.  </p><p>There are some words that even if said, one still wouldn't understand.  </p><p>There are also words that even unsaid, one would still understand.</p><p>Qin Chu thought that he could make that decision by himself for Huo Mian's good, but Huo Mian thought like she had been left in the dark. </p><p>His actions hurt her self-esteem. </p><p>Huo Mian went to her room but couldn't sleep the entire night. She wasn't in a good mood either. </p><p>The next morning, she got up at 6 AM for work to avoid seeing Qin Chu. </p><p>But she still bumped into him in the living room. </p><p>\"You're up early.\" Qin Chu was in a white shirt, holding two glasses of milk in his hands. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" she said, clearly trying to breeze past him. </p><p>\"Have some breakfast before you leave.\" </p><p>\"No, I'm not hungry.\" Huo Mian opened the door and walked out. </p><p>- First Hospital -</p><p>Huo Mian helped discharge Zhixin from the hospital and then got him a cab home.  </p><p>\"Mom, the doctor said Zhixin still needs to rest for a month. I told the school already. It will probably be hard work taking care of him. Make him some ginseng soup to help him recover.\" </p><p>\"I know. Do I really need you to tell me this?\" Yang Meirong said dryly. </p><p>\"Sis, have some food before you leave. I want to have lunch with you.\" Zhixin sowed a smile full of sunshine. </p><p>\"Raincheck, I still have things to do at the hospital. I'm going back to work, and I will visit you during my break.\" </p><p>After she finished speaking, Huo Mian walked out. Yang Meirong followed her out. </p><p>This was an abandoned suburban area in C city. There were a lot of bungalows here for ordinary people to live in because it hadn't been developed yet.  </p><p>After Huo Mian's grandparents passed away, Yang Meirong, their only child, inherited the property. </p><p>It was a small courtyard house. It had east and west wings and an old elm tree by the front of the door. </p><p>Although the house was old and broken, it was neat and clean. Yang Meirong made a living by running a little grocery store in the shed by the door. </p><p>They lived here for many years. Huo Mian was nostalgic towards this place.</p><p>\"Wait up, I have something to ask you,\" Yang Meirong chased after her, shouting from behind.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":94,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:26.483","Link":"Chapter-94","NameDisplay":"Chapter 94"},{"ID":18112094827246562,"Name":"Chapter 95: How to Beg for Forgiveness","NameUnsign":"Chapter 95: How to Beg for Forgiveness","Description":"<p>Chapter 95: How to Beg for Forgiveness</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian turned around to see her mother catching up with her. </p><p>\"Mom, what's wrong?\" </p><p>\"Did that asshole say anything to you when you went?\" Yang Meirong asked with a grim expression.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately knew who her mom was talking about, and she lowered her voice, \"He asked me how you've been doing these past few years.\" </p><p>\"Bullshit, if I was doing well, would I open a small grocery store in this damn place? Damn heartless douchebag.\" Yang Meirong's face was filled with rage. </p><p>Huo Mian remained silent... </p><p>\"What I meant was, did he ask you to work for the Huo Corporation? You are his daughter after all.\" </p><p>\"Oh, yeah, he asked me if I wanted to go back and I said no,\" Huo Mian replied honestly. </p><p>\"What? You said no? Are you an idiot?\" Yang Meirong pushed Huo Mian so hard that she almost fell to the ground.</p><p>\"Mom, you know that we've been doing well without his help all these years.\" </p><p>\"No, we are not doing well. Why on earth would you think we are doing well? Your grades were so good, but you only attended a second-rate medical school in our city. You're not even a doctor, just a nurse intern. When Zhixin got into that accident and needed money for his operation, you had to borrow money from everyone you knew. As for me, I'm working my ass off in a grocery shop in this stupid neighborhood. Does that seem well to you?\" Yang Meirong was getting a little emotional. </p><p>\"But mom, at least we lived all these years peacefully. If you live in luxury, you would have to fight and scheme with others, is that really what you want?\" </p><p>Her mother didn't say anything after hearing what Huo Mian said… </p><p>\"When I was there this time, I saw the feud between those two women and the conspiracies between their children. I don't think there's anything crueler than that. The only thing left between the members of their family is personal gain. Do you want me to become like that?\" </p><p>\"But at least we would have money and wouldn't have to suffer.\" </p><p>\"I have money, and I can make more. Mom, don't worry. I will help you and Zhixin live a comfortable life. I am not going back to the Huo family even if you yell at me or hit me, period.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's attitude was firm. No matter what Yang Meirong said, she made it clear that she was not going back to the Huo family. </p><p>When this gal was as stubborn as this, nobody could do anything about it… </p><p>Huo Mian left home and went straight to the First Hospital for her shift. </p><p>Qin Chu, however, stayed at the GK headquarters all day long, looking particularly depressed. </p><p>\"President Qin isn't very happy today. You all better do your jobs well and don't make any mistakes. Got it?\" Assistant Yang sneakily said to the female assistants who were organizing materials in the assistants' office. </p><p>\"He doesn't look too bad. You can never tell if he's happy or not; he always looks like that. Actually, you can't even tell any of his emotions from his face. Anyways… Assistant Yang, how did you know his mood?\" </p><p>\"If I couldn't tell, I wouldn't be much of his personal assistant. Anyways, you guys need to be careful. Don't cause any trouble.\" </p><p>After he finished talking, he knocked on the door and went into the president's office. </p><p>\"President Qin, this is what your schedule looks like for this afternoon: first you have the meeting with the clients from Thailand at 2 PM, golf with President Zheng from Tian He Trading Company at 4:30 PM, and a charity banquet tonight at 6.\" </p><p>\"Got it,\" Qin Chu answered, obviously distracted. </p><p>\"Em… President Qin, do you have a date for the banquet?\" Assistant Yang asked hesitantly. </p><p>\"No.\" </p><p>\"Do you want…?\"</p><p>\"No.\" He was shut down by Qin Chu before he could finish his sentence. </p><p>\"Okay, I'll just see myself out now.\" Then Assistant Yang headed out. </p><p>He wondered what could be wrong with the president. For one, he didn't drive that low-key white Volkswagen CC today. </p><p>Instead, he switched to a high-profile Maybach of the most expensive make; it was extremely flashy. </p><p>Second, instead of Rene \"Milk Tea\" Liu's songs, a sad English song lingered in the president's office. </p><p>So, he boldly guessed that the president was not in a good mood. Maybe he was fighting with his girlfriend? </p><p>Just as he was thinking this over, Assistant Yang heard the president's voice from behind. </p><p>\"Wait.\" </p><p>\"President Qin, can I assist with anything else?\" </p><p>\"If a woman is mad at you, how do you reconcile with her?\" </p><p>\"Reconcile?\" Assistant Yang was confused. </p><p>\"Sir, do you want to know how to make a girl stop being angry at you?\" Assistant Yang asked, not sure if that was what he was referring to. </p><p>\"Pretty much,\" Qin Chu said as he typed quickly on his laptop.  </p><p>\"So, sir, did you make your girlfriend mad?\" Assistant Yang asked fearlessly.</p><p>His question was soon followed by the president's deadly glare…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":95,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:27.027","Link":"Chapter-95","NameDisplay":"Chapter 95"},{"ID":181120948275397053,"Name":"Chapter 96: Drinking Buddy","NameUnsign":"Chapter 96: Drinking Buddy","Description":"<p>Chapter 96: Drinking Buddy</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I didn't hire you to gossip about my private matters.\" </p><p>\"Yes, yes, yes, I understand, boss. Ha, all I meant was that I need to know what happened first to give you advice. I am experienced in these things. I courted my wife for three years before she agreed to go out with me. We dated for two years and then, after knowing each other for almost five years, we got married. My wife is an incredibly unique woman, and thanks to her, I've gotten very good at making her happy.\" Assistant Yang smiled. </p><p>\"Tell me what you would do.\" </p><p>\"Buy her flowers. Buy her ninety-nine red roses and deliver them to her at work.\" </p><p>\"Cheesy,\" Qin Chu said coldly. </p><p>\"Buy her gifts then. Expensive ones - diamonds rings or other stuff like that. Girls usually love them.\" </p><p>\"She doesn't.\" </p><p>Qin Chu knew Huo Mian too well. She didn't care about materialistic things. </p><p>\"Then pretend to deliver her a package. You can hide in the box, and surprise her. Haha. When I did that, my wife was so freaked out that she actually burst into te…\" Assistant Yang swallowed the rest of the sentence before he finished because he realized that the president's face had become even grimmer... </p><p>\"You can leave now. I need peace.\" </p><p>Qin Chu seriously wondered if his assistant was there to help him, or to make things more difficult. </p><p>How did he get a wife, with an EQ as low as this? It was a mystery. </p><p>\"Okay, boss.\" </p><p>Assistant Yang walked out glumly. He suddenly remembered something. Was the name of the president's girlfriend 'Peace'? </p><p>He just said that he needed 'Peace'. </p><p>However, he did get one thing right - his boss really was missing someone, but her name was not 'Peace'.</p><p>Qin Chu grabbed his phone several times, wondering if he should call her. However, he also thought it might not be an appropriate time because they were still giving each other the silent treatment. </p><p>He didn't have anything to say anyway… </p><p>He repressed his yearnings and knocked his right hand anxiously on the desk, without a rhythm. He looked extremely out of sorts. </p><p>However, Gao Ran's phone call came in at the right moment… </p><p>\"Hey, I haven't heard from you since I helped you out last time. Aren't you supposed to buy me a drink?\" </p><p>\"Let's go.\" </p><p>\"Right now?\" Gao Ran was stunned. </p><p>\"Yes, right now, the same old Szechuan Restaurant down south. See you later.\" </p><p>After he finished talking, Qin Chu put on his sapphire-colored slim-fit suit jacket, grabbed his phone, opened the door, and walked out. </p><p>The female assistants in the assistants' office immediately began to fawn over him… </p><p>\"The president looks super hot in those clothes, doesn't he?\" </p><p>\"It doesn't matter what he wears. He's good-looking, so he'll look good wearing anything, or just nothing.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, I don't even need to talk to him; I am satisfied just by looking at him. I wonder what type of girl he likes. I am so jealous of her.\" </p><p>- Inside the Szechuan Restaurant - </p><p>Gao Ran and Qin Chu sat across from each other in a private room on the second floor. </p><p>\"You looked bummed,\" Gao Ran started the conversation. </p><p>Qin Chu didn't say anything. Instead, he filled up two cups with baijiu. He passed one to Gao Ran and left one for himself. </p><p>Then, he raised the cup and gestured at it. </p><p>Gao Ran took the hint, and chugged it… </p><p>\"Now this is strong. Wine and liquor are jokes. In my opinion, our Chinese grain-brewed baijiu is the best. Three shots and my whole body is on fire. It's a painfully amazing feeling, ha!\"</p><p>\"You are pretty chill lately, aren't you?\" Qin Chu raised his head and looked at him. </p><p>\"Yeah, the criminal police only take on big cases, and trivial cases are left for the local police stations. We have nothing to do with them.\" </p><p>\"That's good. I kinda admire you. You can stick with one job and live peacefully until you get old.\" </p><p>\"I admire you. You are the boss of your company and are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. I bet you have pretty girls throwing themselves at you every day.\" </p><p>\"Ran, I got married.\" Qin Chu's lips quirked up into a deep smile.</p><p>Fortunately, Gao Ran had already swallowed the baijiu; otherwise, he would definitely have choked on it.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":96,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:27.54","Link":"Chapter-96","NameDisplay":"Chapter 96"},{"ID":18112094828429179,"Name":"Chapter 97: Agreement","NameUnsign":"Chapter 97: Agreement","Description":"<p>Chapter 97: Agreement</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Wait a minute, what did you just say?\" </p><p>\"I'm married.\" </p><p>\"Stop pulling my leg, it's not April Fools today.\" Gao Ran didn't believe him. </p><p>\"I'm not kidding.\" </p><p>\"But… this is big, how have I not heard about this? The press didn't report it either. This doesn't make sense.\" </p><p>\"We just got our license and didn't hold a wedding. Besides, she didn't want to go public with our marriage.\" </p><p>\"You married... Huo Mian?\" Gao Ran probed after regaining his senses from the shock. </p><p>Qin Chu nodded… </p><p>\"This woman is literally the end of you. I really don't see what's so great about her. When we were in school, she was so bossy and cocky. She hurt you so much back in the day. If I were you, I would have found someone much better than her purely out of revenge.\" </p><p>\"But in my eyes, there's no one better than her in this world,\" Qin Chu said, with sadness in his eyes. </p><p>\"Alright, alright, alright, don't say these cheesy words to me. But don't you think that you are rushing into this? Marriage is such a serious thing. Didn't you think it through?\" </p><p>Gao Ran felt like the news Qin Chu dropped on him was like a bomb going off in his brain that blew away all thoughts and logic. </p><p>\"I decided that I wanted to marry her seven years ago. I don't need to think it through anymore,\" Qin Chu answered firmly. </p><p>\"But, Chu, people change. The Huo Mian seven years ago might be different than she is now.\" </p><p>\"No matter how she changes, she's still Huo Mian. That's good enough.\" </p><p>After hearing what Qin Chu said, Gao Ran's eyes turned red… </p><p>He raised his cup, \"I am a f*cking dude, but if I were a chick, I would chase you to the end of the earth. It's probably easier to discover national treasures than to find someone who's loyal and rich like you.\" </p><p>Qin Chu remained silent at Gao Ran's words... </p><p>Under the influence of alcohol, Gao Ran suddenly asked, \"Dude, tell me the truth, what agreement did you and your dad make seven years ago? I am so curious.\" </p><p>Qin Chu raised his head and answered slowly, \"Seven years ago, I told my dad that I was going to marry Huo Mian. He gave me his blessing, but I would have to go overseas and come back to take over the family business and GK. What's more is that I couldn't come back to visit during that seven years nor could I keep in touch with anyone, especially Huo Mian. If I did, I would be violating our agreement. If I could do it and make it back seven years later, and neither of us was married, he would allow us to get married.\" </p><p>\"Gosh, so this is why you left without saying anything?\" Gao Ran was surprised. </p><p>Qin Chu looked out the window, his eyes becoming deep and pensive, \"I was still young seven years ago and couldn't provide her with a comfortable life. If we blindly rushed into marriage together, it would have been a tragedy. It's better that I suffer through a temporary painful separation of seven years in exchange for a happily ever after with her.\" </p><p>Gao Ran's eyes were filled with astonishment… </p><p>\"Qin Chu, does she know you did this?\" </p><p>\"No, she doesn't.\" </p><p>\"God, this woman doesn't know anything. You are such a…\" Gao Ran didn't know what to say anymore. </p><p>He thought that Qin Chu's persistence had exceeded the normal range… </p><p>\"Chu, I think you might be obsessed. I would say go see a psychiatrist. It's not good for you.\" </p><p>\"So what if I'm obsessed? The only thing I'm obsessed with is her. I don't care about anything else.\" </p><p>Staring at Qin Chu for a while, Gao Ran said profoundly, \"Huo Mian is really lucky. But she didn't easily say 'yes' to the marriage right? Based on what I know about her.\" </p><p>Gao Ran knew what kind of person Huo Mian was; he also knew about the drama between them seven years ago. </p><p>\"Right, so I blackmailed her. I proposed marriage when she needed my help.\" </p><p>\"But… aren't you afraid that she will hate you for what you did?\" Gao Ran looked at his friend sympathetically.</p><p>Qin Chu's eyes dimmed a little at his question…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":97,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:28.043","Link":"Chapter-97","NameDisplay":"Chapter 97"},{"ID":181120948285713258,"Name":"Chapter 98: Going Crazy","NameUnsign":"Chapter 98: Going Crazy","Description":"<p>Chapter 98: Going Crazy</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"One day, she will understand.\" After saying that, Qin Chu lifted the shot glass in his hand and downed it.</p><p>Gao Ran had originally wanted to get drinks with his good friend to cheer him up, but instead, he seemed more depressed.</p><p>Upon leaving, Qin Chu had to help Gao Ran walk, who seemed to be mildly drunk.</p><p>\"Chu, I'm telling you, that brat Huo Mian has such a screwed-up personality.

Even I'm jealous of him and I'm a man.\"</p><p>\"What if the reason why the captain has never had a girlfriend is that he actually likes men?\"</p><p>\"No way! But the captain is so masculine. If he was gay, I'd bet that he's the one on top.\"</p><p>\"Looks like you all have gotten too bored recently. Everyone needs to go out on a mission. Now.\" At some point, Gao Ran appeared in the doorway holding his head. He had originally wanted to drink some water but ended up hearing the others talking about him.</p><p>\"Ha, captain, we're just joking, but speaking of, that car your friend drove was so flashy. He must be some rich guy, right?\"</p><p>\"Not only is he rich, he has so much money that you wouldn't be able to spend it all in this lifetime,\" Gao Ran said after taking a sip of water.</p><p>\"Captain, does that friend of yours have a girlfriend yet? My third sister is 27 years old this year, and she has a master's degree…\" Gao Ran flicked the younger policeman in the head, cutting him off mid-sentence.</p><p>\"Eh, Song, didn't you say that you were saving your sister for Captain Gao last time?\" another officer interjected.</p><p>Gao Ran became stressed just listening to them...</p><p>Huo Mian was busy at the hospital all day, occasionally pulling out her phone to check the time. Her phone was exceptionally quiet today.</p><p>Not even a single call... looks like my words last night were too harsh. Is he angry now? Huo Mian thought.</p><p>Following this, she got up with her cup and walked to the lounge to get some water, but ended up bumping into Ning Zhiyuan right outside the door.</p><p>\"Mian.\" Ning Zhiyuan's face was slightly red, and his breath reeked of alcohol.</p><p>\"Did you want something?\"</p><p>\"I'm here for you.\" He stepped closer, and Huo Mian unconsciously took two steps back, increasing the distance between them.</p><p>\"What is it, tell me.\"</p><p>\"Are you still unwilling to forgive me?\"</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, we've talked about this before, I don't want to continue this conversation,\" Huo Mian looked at him, speaking calmly.</p><p>\"Mian, but I can't let go of you. I can't forget you.\" Ning Zhiyuan's eyes were red as if he had been crying.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, we're not kids anymore, don't be like this.\"</p><p>\"I know I was wrong, Mian, I'm sorry, give me another chance, one last chance, okay? Let's not mention the past anymore, let's just stick to our original plan and get married, okay? I'll give you back your portion of the down payment on the apartment, you don't need to worry about the mortgage, and I'll let you drive my car. I'll transfer the ownership to your name, okay?\"</p><p>\"None of these were fundamental issues, Zhiyuan, we can't go back. I can't turn a blind eye to everything that happened.

There... was no love between us, so there isn't any hate either. You've treated me with great kindness over the past few years, and I don't owe you anything as I have done my best to repay you.\"</p><p>\"You don't owe me anything? Huo Mian, when I was trying to win you over, I bought you a lot of things. Wasn't I the one who made sure you weren't cold and were well looked after? How can you say these things? Don't you have a conscience, huh? Did a dog eat it, you ungrateful woman?\" Ning Zhiyuan covered his swollen forehead, sneering sinisterly. </p><p>Huo Mian maintained her calm demeanor, the gaze with which she used to look at Ning Zhiyuan was now complicated, with an additional hint of sympathy.</p><p>\"True, you did buy me a lot of things back then, but the combined cost of all those things was probably less than 30,000 yuan. I gave you the 60,000 I had saved up for you to use as the down payment for the apartment. The apartment was purchased under your name alone, and since I don't want that money anymore, you can just call it even. In the end, who do you think really owes the other?\"</p><p>\"Fine, so even if you don't owe me from a monetary perspective, what about emotionally? Can you put a monetary value on that? Can you make up for all the emotional effort I've given these years?\" Ning Zhiyuan roared.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled faintly after hearing his words.</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, given how long we've known each other, you should know that I'm not a calculating person. But since you've brought this up, I might as well speak the truth. Honestly, you've been very good to me these past few years, but I haven't treated you poorly either. I often visited your parents, and when your relatives came to the hospital for treatment, not only did I pull connections to get them hospital rooms, I also watched and took care of them through the night. All this was for you, and most importantly… Ning Zhiyuan, I'm asking you, if you didn't have me, would you be as accomplished as you are today? Do you think you would have successfully become a doctor at the First Hospital?\"</p><p>\"You… what do you mean?\" Ning Zhiyuan clearly felt guilty.</p><p>\"My point is obvious. With your grades, you never would've graduated from medical school. I was the one who wrote your thesis, and because your thesis on techniques in ophthalmology was outstanding, the First Hospital's Ophthalmology Department made an exception and accepted you. And even after that, for all these years that you've been on the job, every time you had to write a thesis or report, I was the one who wrote it for you. Isn't all that enough? Tell me, at this moment, what do I owe you?\"</p><p>After Ning Zhiyuan finished listening to Huo Mian speak, he was rendered speechless… </p><p>If Huo Mian hadn't reminded him, he would have almost fooled himself into thinking that he was an exceptional ophthalmologist.</p><p>But everything was done by Huo Mian on his behalf, as his grades during medical school were very mediocre.</p><p>Back then, when it was close to graduation, he felt too stressed out and frequently ditched class to go gaming with his roommates.</p><p>In the end, he almost couldn't graduate. Even the most important component in his graduation, his thesis, was written by Huo Mian.</p><p>And because of that exceptionally-well-written thesis, he was given the opportunity to work at the First Hospital.</p><p>Since then, whenever the hospital conducted employee evaluations, he would get Huo Mian to help him prepare for them. </p><p>He had enjoyed the results, feeling as if his reputation of being a genius doctor was justified. However, was he really the genius? </p><p>Of course not, someone else was the genius, but the other people didn't know that.</p><p>\"So what do you want? Are you going to report me to the hospital? No one will believe it, after all… there's no evidence,\" Ning Zhiyuan said smugly.</p><p>Huo Mian's eyes filled with disappointment after hearing what he said. She didn't know that one could turn so despicable after a breakup.</p><p>\"Evidence? Of course, I have evidence.\"</p><p>\"You do? I don't believe it. You were so trusting of me, so there's no way you would leave behind any evidence.\" Ning Zhiyuan remained unyielding, but his mind became anxious.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":99,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:29.153","Link":"Chapter-99","NameDisplay":"Chapter 99"},{"ID":181120948296882178,"Name":"Chapter 100: Rich","NameUnsign":"Chapter 100: Rich","Description":"<p>Chapter 100: Rich</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Heh, see, if you knew how trusting I was of you at the time, what are you feeling anxious about? What are you afraid of? You think I'd report you? I really don't have the time for that, nor the need to. After all… it wouldn't benefit me. Zhiyuan, I just want to say that we may have broken up, but we are not enemies. We were together for a long time, and we can't become friends because we've hurt each other in the past. I admit, it was because of Qin Chu's unexpected interference that caused our relationship to fragment, but the things that you did afterward truly disappointed me. So, there won't be any more interactions between us, and we will never get back together. I believe, with your current reputation and status, there will be many amazing girls who are lining up for a chance to date you, and you will be fine without me, right?\"</p><p>\"Of course,\" Ning Zhiyuan immediately replied. </p><p>\"Great. I'll forget what happened today, but don't do it again. Please take a left once you exit this room.

Thankfully, there was no one else in the clinic, or else she would've been so embarrassed. </p><p>Not long after, Huang Yue walked in and. Upon seeing the pen holder on the floor, she exclaimed, \"Oh my God, what happened? My poor pen holder.\" </p><p>\"Eh… I'm sorry, I accidentally knocked it over when I was grabbing something earlier. I'll buy you a new one.\" </p><p>\"Hm....\" Huang Yue pursed her lips, looking like she had been bullied. </p><p>\"I'll even throw in a family bucket from KFC,\" knowing the nurse's personality, Huo Mian immediately added. </p><p>\"Okay, deal.\" Huang Yue immediately perked up. </p><p>\"On that note… Mian, you've been very generous lately, even treating me to KFC. Tell me, did you get rich recently?\" </p><p>\"No, if I were rich, I would have quit a long time ago.\" </p><p>\"Then did you find a rich guy to lean on?\" Huang Yue asked secretively. </p><p>\"Eh…\" Huo Mian thought for a bit... Does Qin Chu count as a rich guy? Not really, he was more of a billionaire, right? </p><p>So, she shook her head, \"Nope, no rich guy to lean on.\" </p><p>\"Oh, I got it, your brother's case was resolved, wasn't it? The perpetrator must have paid a lot of money, right?\" Huang Yue smiled happily. </p><p>\"Yeah, that's right. Gosh, you are smart.\" Huo Mian was afraid of her probing deeper, so she nodded her head vaguely. </p><p>But in reality, she didn't get any money from Zhixin's case. </p><p>All the other victims did, but she originally wanted to sue them in court and receive payment for the hospital bills. </p><p>But she never thought that in the end, thanks to Qin Chu's involvement, the perpetrator's entire family were met with disaster. </p><p>He was already locked up, so what more could he give as compensation? </p><p>Either way, the fact that Zhixin was okay was already her biggest comfort. </p><p>\"Oh right, it's lunchtime, let's go to the cafeteria. If we're late, then all the good dishes will be gone.\" </p><p>Not waiting for Huo Mian to reply, Huang Yue dragged her towards the cafeteria in a hurry. </p><p>The hospital's cafeteria was on the second-floor basement and could only be accessed by the hospital's staff. </p><p>But most doctors didn't eat there since their high incomes allowed them to order delivery. </p><p>On the other hand, intern nurses like Huo Mian and Huang Yue had low incomes and few bonuses, and would, therefore, come here to eat. </p><p>At lunchtime, the cafeteria would usually be crowded with people, but the overall environment was pretty good. </p><p>Huang Yue and Huo Mian found a table with seats facing each other in a corner, and they had just settled in when they heard a female voice yell rudely, \"Huo Mian, you bitch!

Her face was slathered in seductive makeup, but her complexion was extremely unsightly. </p><p>\"Mian, right there. Huh, isn't she a nurse from the ophthalmology department?\" Huang Yue pointed at the door. </p><p>Huo Mian turned around, her demeanor remaining calm upon spotting He Man.</p><p>He Man spotted Huo Mian at the same time, and she made a beeline straight for her aggressively.  </p><p>\"Mian, she looks like she's up to no good! Be careful,\" Huang Yue warned her quietly. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, not saying anything. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, get up.\" </p><p>\"Is there a problem?\" </p><p>\"Of course there's a problem! Do you think I've come to have a heart-to-heart with you?\" </p><p>\"Sorry, I don't have time to have a heart-to-heart with you, we're not that close.\" Huo Mian sat down and continued eating, not even acknowledging her. </p><p>He Man's temper flared up, and she pointed at Huo Mian while screeching, \"Stop pretending! Tell me, are you harassing my Zhiyuan again?\" </p><p>\"Your Zhiyuan? When did this happen?\"</p><p>He Man slightly paused and then said, \"Don't pretend you don't know, Zhiyuan and I started dating a long time ago. You've known this for a while.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded slightly, and then she replied in a pondering manner, \"Oh, so last week when I went over to his apartment, the person bumping uglies with him in the bedroom was you?\" </p><p>\"What? Last weekend?\" He Man's complexion paled. </p><p>\"Oh? Wasn't it you? Unless...\" Huo Mian probed. </p><p>\"Of course… it was me.\" Anyone could tell how forced He Man's words were.</p><p>\"Since you so clearly know that we're together, why did you still go looking for him? Didn't you already break up?\" </p><p>\"Yeah, I went to ask him for my 60,000 yuan deposit on the apartment. We were originally planning to get married, so I offered some of my own money for the down payment.\" </p><p>\"Oh really? I've never heard Zhiyuan speak about it,\" He Man said proudly. </p><p>\"Really? What a shame. It looks like you two haven't progressed to that stage yet.\" </p><p>\"You… stop distorting my words.\" He Man ran out of words to say. Initially, she had arrogantly came to condemn her, but she didn't think that the normally sweet Huo Mian could be so sharp-tongued. Each of her sentences was as sharp as a dagger, causing her to be at a loss for words. </p><p>\"Tell me, did you bruise Zhiyuan's head?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"What gave you that right? What made you think you had the right to hit Zhiyuan? What right do you have, as a dumped ex-girlfriend, to interfere in Zhiyuan's matters? I knew it! You probably hit him because he wouldn't get back together with you when you asked, didn't you?\" </p><p>Huo Mian's eyes grew cold, and she lifted her head to ask, \"Did Ning Zhiyuan tell you that?\" </p><p>\"Zhiyuan didn't say it, but I'm sure that's what happened. Everyone at the hospital knows what kind of person you are.\" </p><p>\"Mian is a great person, everyone in the OB/GYN department knows that,\" Huang Yue interjected. </p><p>\"This has nothing to do with you, shut up,\" He Man pointed at Huang Yue and growled. </p><p>\"Are you done speaking rubbish? If you're done, then please leave. We're in the middle of a meal, and I don't want to ruin my appetite,\" Huo Mian asked her to leave because she didn't want to deal with He Man's unreasonable harassment any longer. </p><p>Because everyone was staring, she felt like a clown. This didn't agree with Huo Mian's usual low-profile character at all.</p><p>\"Eat eat eat, I'll show you how to eat, you b*tch.\" Then, in front of everyone, He Man flipped Huo Mian's plate. The food scattered all over the floor, with some splattering onto Huo Mian's clean white lab coat, causing everyone to stare in shock.

From now on, don't ever go looking for Huo Mian again, or you might as well disappear from my sight.\" Ning Zhiyuan left after glaring at He Man. </p><p>He Man felt unhappy and simultaneously confused about one other thing. </p><p>Since Ning Zhiyuan and Huo Mian had already broken up, then last weekend, who was the woman Huo Mian saw at Ning Zhiyuan's apartment? </p><p>Of course that wasn't her, because last weekend, she had been at work for 24 hours straight, and didn't even have time to go to Ning Zhiyuan's... </p><p>Unless, Huo Mian was lying? Was she trying to destroy her relationship with Zhiyuan? But it didn't look like she was lying. </p><p>The fight in the cafeteria was originally a small matter, but someone with their own motives had recorded it and distributed it amongst the different departments at the First Hospital. </p><p>Huo Mian, the gentle-looking intern nurse, became famous after this fight. </p><p>People began referring to her as the 'hot and spicy nurse'. </p><p>Along with the fame came the male doctors, assistants, and even the male coworkers who all wanted to get a glimpse of this hot nurse. The most courageous of whom sent flowers and tried asking her out, making Huo Mian unsure as to whether she should laugh or cry. </p><p>Gazing at her desk full of chocolates and flowers, Huo Mian was at a loss for words. </p><p>\"Mian, what should we do? You're the famous hot and spicy nurse now.\" </p><p>\"Hot and spicy?

We're not soft tomatoes that people can just bully around.\" </p><p>\"Mhm.\" Huo Mian was speechless. </p><p>\"There's also one more thing I wanted to talk to you about.\" </p><p>\"Go ahead, Head Nurse,\" Huo Mian said with respect. She looked like she was prepared for any task that her superior might give her. </p><p>\"Well, you're single now. I just happen to have a distant cousin who is working in our city. He's a great guy and isn't too far from your age, but most importantly, he also works in the medical field. He's in forensics. I think you guys would be great together, so I've planned for the two of you to meet next week.\" </p><p>\"Uhm… Head Nurse, are you possibly trying to introduce me to a boyfriend?\" </p><p>\"Yes, the little nurses in our hospital aren't so reliable. You are all about the same age, but you're the only one who is mature and low-key, so I think you would be perfect for my cousin. Don't worry about his family situation. He has a house and a car, and his parents are both doing business down south. So if you guys get married, it'll just be the two of you. It will be great.\" </p><p>\"But… Head Nurse, I… Someone else has already introduced me to a potential boyfriend.\" </p><p>\"Already?\" The head nurse was clearly surprised. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't dare to say that she was married. She worried that it might scare the head nurse, so instead, she lied that someone had already introduced her to someone. </p><p>\"Yes, so I can't double-dip. Thank you for the kind offer.\" </p><p>\"It's not a problem. You're still unmarried, we'll prepare you on all fronts, and let you pick amongst the best. It's decided, I'll plan for you guys to meet next week. Okay, I will go now.\" </p><p>\"Uhm… Head Nurse.\" No matter how Huo Mian called, the head nurse refused to listen.  </p><p>However, the problem was that she was already married. Was it really okay for her to be set up for a date? </p><p>If that person found out, he'll probably strangle her... </p><p>After 24 hours of the silent treatment, both of them refused to call or text the other. It was a weird feeling.</p><p>Huo Mian was slightly disappointed when she saw how quiet her phone was. It seemed like she wasn't so important to Qin Chu after all. </p><p>At this lonely thought, Huo Mian got off work.

You're drunk.\" Huo Mian couldn't move at all as he was hugging her too tightly. </p><p>\"No,\" Qin Chu stubbornly said after a short silence. </p><p>\"Qin Chu, what do you want?\" </p><p>\"What do you think I want?\" Qin Chu pinched Huo Mian's chin as he closely stared at her profile. </p><p>All of a sudden, an intimate atmosphere filled the entire room. </p><p>Huo Mian bit her lips and didn't know how to respond. </p><p>Qin Chu couldn't suppress his desires, as he looked at Huo Mian, who was so close to him, while his other hand swept across her back. </p><p>He knew what he wanted. </p><p>She also knew what he wanted. </p><p>\"Qin Chu, don't be like this. I'm… not ready yet.\" Huo Mian weakly pushed him aside after she spoke. </p><p>Qin Chu's body staggered, and he fell onto the couch behind him. </p><p>\"I'm sorry.\" Huo Mian turned around, refusing to look into his eyes. </p><p>\"Why would you apologize?\" Qin Chu asked as he looked at her. </p><p>\"I…\" She didn't know how to respond. </p><p>\"I should be the one to apologize. I'm sorry. I shouldn't do those things behind your back. I just didn't want you to be hurt,\" said Qin Chu as he turned his head away from her.</p><p>\"No, you didn't do anything wrong. I didn't know better. You meant well, and I shouldn't have been so irrational. If you didn't help me, Zhixin's surgery wouldn't have been so successful, and I wouldn't have been able to pay off the bills. If you didn't help me, the perpetrator would never have faced justice. Qin Chu, you're truly too good for me.\" </p><p>In fact, Huo Mian had already thought this whole thing through.</p><p>She knew that no matter what Qin Chu did, he always meant well. To an extent, she was the one who was being unreasonable for treating him that way. </p><p>\"Do you really think so?\" Qin Chu was somewhat surprised. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded… </p><p>She hesitated for a bit and then continued, \"I know that we're already legally married, so some things are bound to happen. I'm not putting on a show, and I don't despise you, it's just that… I'm not ready yet. Please don't make it harder for me, okay?\" </p><p>\"So… you feel troubled by what I want to do?\" Qin Chu's eyes filled with loneliness as he spoke. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't say anything. Instead, she bit her lips. </p><p>\"Okay, I won't trouble you then. It's late and you should go to bed soon. Goodnight,\" said Qin Chu as he turned around to head upstairs. </p><p>Huo Mian knew that she had disappointed Qin Chu again. </p><p>She couldn't sleep at all that night. </p><p>Early next morning, Huo Mian woke up early to prepare breakfast. Shortly afterwards, she saw Qin Chu walking down the stairs. </p><p>He saw a steaming array of Chinese breakfast dishes on the table. There were fried eggs, cups of soy milk, and golden potato pancakes. </p><p>\"Go on, eat.\" Smiled Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian was wearing a pink apron, while her hair was messy like a real housewife. </p><p>Qin Chu was still upset with her, and he originally wanted to say no, but when he saw how down-to-earth Huo Mian looked, he couldn't refuse at all. He had always dreamed of this scene in front of him. </p><p>He didn't say anything. Instead he sat before the breakfast table, held up the soybean milk, and took a sip.</p><p>\"I bought the soybeans at the supermarket so I could freshly press the soymilk. It looks very concentrated, so I don't know if that's good or not. How is it? Does it taste okay?\" asked Huo Mian carefully.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":104,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:32.53","Link":"Chapter-104","NameDisplay":"Chapter 104"},{"ID":18112094833504033,"Name":"Chapter 105: Warmth","NameUnsign":"Chapter 105: Warmth","Description":"<p>Chapter 105: Warmth</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"It's not bad.\" Qin Chu nodded. </p><p>\"Good, have some more then.\" Huo Mian smiled in relief. </p><p>The two of them ate breakfast across from each other. Qin Chu didn't say anything, but he would occasionally raise his head to look at Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, ate with great appetite. She had been eating western breakfast food for quite a while now, and it was rare for her to have a homemade Chinese breakfast. Thus, for her, the food tasted especially delicious. </p><p>No matter how angry Qin Chu was with her, he would still feel like everything was heaven-sent once he saw her sitting by his side so quietly… </p><p>He had wished for a day like today for seven years. </p><p>\"How is your brother doing? I heard that he was discharged from the hospital,\" Qin Chu suddenly asked. </p><p>\"Yes, he's recovering very well. I told him to rest at home for a while since he's not enrolled in a lot of courses this semester anyway.\" </p><p>\"Good,\" Qin Chu nodded. </p><p>After breakfast, the two left home together. </p><p>Huo Mian had been taking the bus to work for the past few days because Qin Chu was driving the Maybach. </p><p>\"Let me drive you if you don't mind this car.\" </p><p>Huo Mian looked at the car and felt uncomfortable… </p><p>\"I can park the car further away,\" Qin Chu added. </p><p>\"Okay,\" Huo Mian nodded and thought that he was trying hard to compromise. </p><p>On the way, Qin Chu turned on the music inside the car, and the famous English song Hotel California started playing. </p><p>The melody was mesmerizing, and it was a song that Huo Mian liked, so she soon began singing along.</p><p> \"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair </p><p> warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air </p><p> up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light </p><p> my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim </p><p> I had to stop for the night. </p><p> There she stood in the doorway; </p><p> I heard the mission bell </p><p> and I was thinking to myself </p><p> this could be heaven and this could be hell </p><p> then she lit up a candle </p><p> and she showed me the way </p><p> there were voices down that corridor, </p><p> I thought I heard them say </p><p> welcome to the hotel California </p><p> such a lovely place </p><p> such a lovely place </p><p> such a lovely face. </p><p> There's plenty of room at the Hotel California </p><p> any time of year </p><p> any time of year </p><p> you can find us here.\" </p><p>\"You're a good singer,\" Qin Chu suddenly said. </p><p>Huo Mian suddenly realized what she was doing and awkwardly lowered her head. </p><p>\"You have a beautiful voice,\" Qin Chu said again. </p><p>\"Thanks.\" </p><p>\"California is a beautiful place, the sea is endless there, the sky is blue, and the air is fresh. The pace of living is also very slow there.\" </p><p>Qin Chu had been in America for seven years and pretty much visited all of the states…</p><p>\"Yes, I've seen it on television. It really is gorgeous.\" </p><p>\"I'll take you there on vacation when we have time,\" Qin Chu suddenly said. </p><p>\"Okay.\" Smiled Huo Mian. </p><p>Even though no one knew when this might happen, since Qin Chu proposed, she couldn't possibly disappoint him. </p><p>\"Do you have a driver's license?\" </p><p>\"I do.\" Huo Mian nodded. A driving school held an event at her college graduation. It was half price, so she and Ning Zhiyuan both took the course and got their licenses.</p><p>\"Then you can drive the CC. It will be easier for you to commute in a car. Don't take the bus, it takes too long.\" </p><p>\"No, it's fine. We don't live very far from the hospital, and there's a parking space shortage already. A little nurse like me doesn't have a designated parking spot anyways, so it's not necessary.\" Huo Mian smiled. </p><p>\"Why… don't you quit that job of yours?\" </p><p>\"Are you saying that I should be a fulltime housewife?\" Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu as if he had just said something absurd. </p><p>\"No, I know that you want to keep yourself busy. You don't have to stay at home; instead, you could help me at GK, just pick a department you like. If you still want to work in the medical field, then I can establish a wellness department. It can provide GK employees with check-ups, for illnesses and stuff. I can even get a doctor to assist you, or I could even open up a private clinic for you.\" </p><p>Qin Chu was truly willing to do anything for Huo Mian… </p><p>Huo Mian knew that Qin Chu always kept his word, but it was absurd to open up a clinic just for her. </p><p>He shouldn't do that, even if he had all the money in the world…. </p><p>\"No, really, but thank you for the gesture. I really like the job I have right now. It's very fulfilling. The truth is, some jobs can't be evaluated with money, it's where my interests lie. The OB/GYN department that I'm in is the busiest department of the entire hospital, but I really do love it there because I get to witness the birth of many lives every day. I can't explain that kind of joy. Qin Chu, if you truly mean well, then let me do the things I love. Just that would be great.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Qin Chu nodded, acknowledging that he respected her choice. </p><p>Then, he stopped the car slowly, \"We're nearly there, you can get off here.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>\"Mian,\" Qin Chu suddenly called out gently.</p><p>Huo Mian turned around, but before she knew what was going on, Qin Chu kissed her on the lips.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":105,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:33.05","Link":"Chapter-105","NameDisplay":"Chapter 105"},{"ID":181120948335496159,"Name":"Chapter 106: Harassment","NameUnsign":"Chapter 106: Harassment","Description":"<p>Chapter 106: Harassment</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I'll see you tonight,\" Qin Chu said quietly. </p><p>With one hand, Huo Mian covered her blushing face and rushed out of the car. </p><p>Then without turning her head back, she ran towards the hospital. </p><p>Shortly afterward, Qin Chu's Maybach turned around and drove in another direction. </p><p>When she reached the hospital entrance, Huo Mian saw a silver-white BMW 730 that slowly parked in the parking space nearest to the entrance. </p><p>Huo Mian was somewhat confused. This parking spot belonged to the hospital director, but he drove an Audi A8. </p><p>As she was wondering, a woman got out of the car. The woman was very young, in her twenties at most. </p><p>Her eyes weren't so big, but she had long and delicate eyebrows, and she wore a close-fitted red dress that attracted attention. </p><p>The woman wasn't very pretty, but she had great class. With one look, one could tell that she was clearly brought up in a wealthy family. </p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to head inside, she heard the woman say coquettishly, \"Zhiyuan, help me grab my bag.\" </p><p>Huo Mian immediately turned around and saw Ning Zhiyuan getting off from the driver's seat with an Hérmes bag in his hand. </p><p>Then he handed the bag to the woman, and the two held each other's hands as they headed towards the door. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression slightly changed when he saw Huo Mian… </p><p>However, he only glanced at her for a split second. Then, as if he had just seen a complete stranger, he held the woman's hand as they proudly walked inside. </p><p>\"Huh? Isn't he dating He Man?\" Huo Mian said to herself. </p><p>Huo Mian conducted fetal heart monitoring on expecting mothers all morning. When she looked at the time after she finally finished, she realized that lunchtime had already passed. </p><p>\"Big Sis Mian, here. I brought some food for you, but the dishes don't look very good today. I hate cabbages the most.\" Huang Yue walked over with two bento boxes in her hands. </p><p>\"Thanks, Yue.\" Huo Mian smiled. </p><p>Then, Huo Mian opened up the bento boxes and dug in. Once a person becomes hungry enough, they would forget to be picky. </p><p>The dishes Huang Yue despised were now delicacies in Huo Mian's eyes. </p><p>Just then, an unexpected guest arrived at the door, \"Huo Mian, let's talk.\" </p><p>\"Uhm… will this be another fight?\" Huang Yue twisted her lips after she saw He Man. </p><p>After Huo Mian ate her last bite of food, she slowly raised her head, and without any expressions, she said, \"I have nothing to say to you.\" </p><p>\"I'm not here to pick a fight, and I'm not here to cause trouble. I really need to tell you something.\" </p><p>\"Go on then, tell me and leave.\" Huo Mian wasn't acting pleasant at all. </p><p>He Man glanced at Huang Yue, and then looked back at Huo Mian as she said, \"Did you know that Ning Zhiyuan found himself another woman?\" </p><p>\"What does that have to do with me?\" asked Huo Mian in response. </p><p>\"Do you know who she is? She's the niece of our hospital director, Director Wu. She just got back from studying abroad in Japan and was also a talented medical school student. They say that she'll be assigned to the OB/GYN department.\" </p><p>\"So what?\" Huo Mian didn't think this had anything to do with her. </p><p>He Man stared at Huo Mian and continued, \"Director Wu spoils his niece, and that's why Ning Zhiyuan picked her to hit on. He just wants to climb his way up, what a terrible guy. Now I've finally seen through him. I think the woman you saw in Ning Zhiyuan's apartment a while back was probably her.\" </p><p>\"So?\" Huo Mian got up and asked He Man curiously. </p><p>\"So, I came to find you, because I want us to work together. We have to look for Director Wu's niece and reveal Ning Zhiyuan's true colors to her. Who knew he would be that kind of man? Did you know? I've already slept with him - he took my virginity. He said that he would take responsibility and marry me.\" </p><p>\"Then you should go find Ning Zhiyuan, there's no point in finding me.\" Huo Mian replied calmly.</p><p>\"I did, but he won't even talk to me. He won't answer my call, and he switched the lock to his apartment. It really pisses me off. Huo Mian, you're one of his victims too. If we unite forces to expose him, then maybe Director Wu's niece will ditch him and then he won't be able to keep working at the hospital. More so, he won't even be able to dream of becoming the director's relative either. What do you think?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":106,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:33.55","Link":"Chapter-106","NameDisplay":"Chapter 106"},{"ID":18112094834776650,"Name":"Chapter 107: Visitor","NameUnsign":"Chapter 107: Visitor","Description":"<p>Chapter 107: Visitor</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Sorry, I have no interest in this.\" </p><p>\"Don't you want to take your revenge? After how he treated you?\" He Man believed that it was her involvement which led to the breakup between Huo Mian and Ning Zhiyuan, and so she thought that Huo Mian hated her. </p><p>\"Ning Zhiyuan and I broke up peacefully. There's no love or hate between us, so I can't agree with your proposal. I've more work to do so you should go.\" After she spoke, Huo Mian sat down by her desk and started to organize documents. </p><p>\"You're such an unbelievable woman….\" He Man viciously stared at Huo Mian after she saw that Huo Mian refused to agree, and then she turned around to leave. </p><p>Huang Yue laughed, \"Karma really hurts. It seems like he chose to abandon that woman in the end. Where did she even find the audacity to claim that she gave her virginity to him? What was that? Was she proud to be the homewrecker?\" </p><p>Huo Mian didn't voice her opinion on this subject. Even though she disliked He Man, she didn't want to say anything bad about her. </p><p>Without a doubt, that woman in the BMW with Ning Zhiyuan this morning must be Director Wu's niece; no wonder they took up the director's parking spot. </p><p>\"Mian, that ex-boyfriend of yours sure has some charms. It didn't take him long to start dating the director's precious niece. I hear that Wu Xiaoxue is a really arrogant person, and hard to approach. Who knew she would end up with Ning Zhiyuan? She must be pretty blind.\" </p><p>\"Well… that's normal.\" Huo Mian smiled, as she responded very calmly to this situation. </p><p>In the afternoon, just as Huo Mian stepped out of the OR, her phone began to ring... </p><p>After she picked up, Huo Mian immediately asked the head nurse if she could take some time off. Then, she ran over to the hospital entrance. </p><p>\"Uncle Ning, Auntie Ning,\" Huo Mian called out to two white-haired elders. </p><p>\"Mian.\" The two elderly couples' expressions immediately lit up when they saw Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Uncle, Auntie, why are you guys here?\" </p><p>\"Oh, your auntie isn't feeling well lately. I wanted to bring her over for a check-up, and it's been a while since we've seen the two of you, so we came over for a visit. I just called Zhiyuan, but his phone is off.\" </p><p>\"Oh, he might be in surgery. He'll call you guys back when he's done.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, that's fine.\" The elderly man nodded. </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's parents lived in a county under the jurisdiction of C City and it was a three-hour car ride from there to here. </p><p>Both of his parents had already retired. They were considerably well-off, and Ning Zhiyuan was their only son. </p><p>The old couple used all of their savings to pay for their son's medical school tuition and to buy the apartment and car. </p><p>Huo Mian used to visit them every year, and they were both really nice people. Uncle Ning used to work at the post office while Auntie Ning was a teacher. </p><p>They both used to be public servants, so they were very reasonable folks. They were also quite pleased with Huo Mian and approved of her as their daughter-in-law. </p><p>Huo Mian predicted from the way they treated her that they had no idea that she and Ning Zhiyuan had already broken up. </p><p>\"Uncle, Auntie, you haven't eaten yet, right? Let me take you to get some food.\"</p><p>\"Sure, let's just find a small restaurant; there's no need to waste money,\" Ning Zhiyuan's mother insisted. </p><p>There was a homely neighborhood restaurant behind the hospital, where Huo Mian ordered two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and a soup.  </p><p>She even ordered a bottle of sake for Ning Zhiyuan's father. </p><p>The elderly couple was very happy. During the meal, Ning Zhiyuan's father asked, \"Mian, has the apartment been renovated yet? When are you guys getting married?\" </p><p>\"Uhm… we're in no hurry. Zhiyuan is still very busy recently, so we want to wait until things slow down.\" </p><p>\"You guys shouldn't wait any longer. You should still get married no matter how busy you are. I've had a discussion with your auntie; we've got about 20,000 yuan in retirement funds, and we think that you guys should take it. You guys could go to Thailand for your honeymoon.\" </p><p>\"There's no need, really. Please don't give us any more money. You should use the money to buy supplements or something else for yourselves. We'll spend the money we earn ourselves.\" Huo Mian felt very uneasy. </p><p>\"Hey, don't say that. We'll be a family soon, and what is ours will also be yours. Oh right, we brought some mushrooms and wild vegetables from the mountains for you guys. Zhiyuan's aunt brought it back from Mount Fala. It's organic and very nutritious,\" said Ning's mother as she handed over a big bag. </p><p>\"There's no need to rush, Auntie. Give it to Zhiyuan when you see him, I still have to get back to work, it isn't very convenient for me to take these now.\"</p><p>\"Mian, did you two get into a fight? Every time I call and ask for you, Zhiyuan would mumble random things and change the topic,\" Ning Zhiyuan's mother suddenly asked .</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":107,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:34.077","Link":"Chapter-107","NameDisplay":"Chapter 107"},{"ID":181120948345822364,"Name":"Chapter 108: Hostility","NameUnsign":"Chapter 108: Hostility","Description":"<p>Chapter 108: Hostility</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"No Auntie, we aren't fighting,\" Huo Mian said with her fingers crossed.</p><p>\"Really? But why do I feel like something's not right?\" Ning Zhiyuan's mother mumbled to herself. </p><p>\"You tend to overthink things like this. See, I told you it was nothing. Mian is a sensible kid; she would never fight with Zhiyuan.\" Ning's father chuckled. </p><p>Huo Mian felt unsettled as she heard what he said. </p><p>After the meal, Huo Mian brought the couple to the First Hospital's outpatient resting area and then headed towards the Ophthalmology Clinic.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan walked out of the surgery room looking slightly tired. He had just finished operating on a cataract patient. </p><p>\"Zhiyuan.\" </p><p>\"What do you want?\" Ning Zhiyuan appeared distant. </p><p>\"Auntie and Uncle Ning are here. They couldn't reach you on your phone, so they called me.\" </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan took out his phone and simply nodded in acknowledgment, \"I had a surgery so my phone was off. Where are they?\" </p><p>\"I took them out for lunch and then brought them to the outpatient resting area.\" </p><p>\"Oh, how much did lunch cost you? I'll pay you back.\" </p><p>\"It's fine. They've always been very kind to me, so treating them to lunch is nothing.\" </p><p>\"Forget it. I can't take advantage of you since it's not like we're friends. Is five hundred enough?\" Ning Zhiyuan took out his wallet and pulled out five 100 yuan bills. He then threw the money at Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Thanks for taking care of my parents. But if there is nothing else, don't contact them in the future. My family has nothing to do with you anymore. I will tell them everything today.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>\"Zhiyuan, what is it?\" Wu Xiaoxue walked over from not far away. She was wearing her white lab coat and glared at Huo Mian in an extremely unfriendly manner. </p><p>\"Oh, my parents are here, and they couldn't reach me on my phone.\" </p><p>\"So, who is she?\" Wu Xiaoxue looked at Huo Mian suspiciously. </p><p>\"She's an old university classmate.\" Ning Zhiyuan turned on his heels as soon as he finished. He grabbed Wu Xiaoxue by the hand and left.</p><p>Huo Mian held on to the five hundred yuan and let out a helpless smile.  </p><p>Lunch was around two hundred yuan, so it was generous of Ning Zhiyuan to give her five hundred. She might as well take it since it was given to her.  </p><p>At that thought, Huo Mian headed back to the OB/GYN department.</p><p>Right before the end of the day, the head nurse walked in, followed by a young woman. </p><p>Huo Mian was not unfamiliar with the woman as she was none other than the Hospital Director's niece – Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>\"Listen up everybody. This is our department's new chief. She will be seeing patients every Friday. Please cooperate with Dr. Wu.\" </p><p>\"Yes Ma'am,\" a few nurses responded immediately. </p><p>\"Come here, Huang Yue. From now on, you will be Dr. Wu's assistant,\" the head nurse said. </p><p>However, Wu Xiaoxue smiled and said, \"Head Nurse, I want Huo Mian to be my assistant.\" </p><p>\"You know Huo Mian, Dr. Wu?\" the head nurse asked with surprise. </p><p>\"Yes, I know her.\" Wu Xiaoxue smiled, but the smile looked rather crooked. </p><p>Huo Mian was surprised as well; she didn't think Wu Xiaoxue would say that.</p><p>\"Okay, if that's the case, Huo Mian, you can be Dr. Wu's assistant. Do a good job.\" The head nurse patted Huo Mian on the shoulder.</p><p>\"I will, Head Nurse.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>Once settled, Huo Mian looked at the clock and proceeded to the changing room. It was almost time to go home.</p><p>\"Huo Mian.\" Wu Xiaoxue chased after her as Huo Mian was heading out. </p><p>\"Yes, Dr. Wu?\" </p><p>\"I have an academic seminar later and need to gather some reports. You need to stay behind to print them for me,\" Wu Xiaoxue said matter-of-factly. </p><p>Huo Mian thought about it for a moment... </p><p>\"There are people in the office who are responsible for printing and photocopying, this is not within my job scope,\" Huo Mian said calmly. </p><p>\"You are my assistant. Do as you are told, or else... I have the right to fire you, you know?\" Wu Xiaoxue was still smiling, clearly very pleased with herself.  </p><p>\"So you are giving me a hard time because of Ning Zhiyuan?\" Huo Mian asked directly. </p><p>\"I didn't think you were so quick-witted. I heard that you're Ning Zhiyuan's ex-girlfriend?\" </p><p>\"Wrong. I'm his ex-ex-girlfriend. His ex-girlfriend is He Man. Looks like your information isn't up to date.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"Who does He Man think she is? She's nothing more than a toy. I heard you've been with Zhiyuan for several years, and you guys were planning to get married, correct?\" Wu Xiaoxue asked provokingly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":108,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:34.583","Link":"Chapter-108","NameDisplay":"Chapter 108"},{"ID":1811209483568903,"Name":"Chapter 109: Embarassment","NameUnsign":"Chapter 109: Embarassment","Description":"<p>Chapter 109: Embarassment</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Yes.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>\"What a shame, it looks like that's not happening in your lifetime.

But if you are here to chitchat, I'm sorry, but I don't have the time.\" </p><p>\"Then hurry up and get my reports ready.\"</p><p>\"Also, it's not very wise of you to hate me because of Ning Zhiyuan, since I'm not a threat to you.\" </p><p>\"A threat? Who do you think you are? You have below-average looks, grew up in a below-average household, and went to a below-average medical school. How do you have the audacity to compare yourself to me? I received my medical degree from Tokyo University. I am also the youngest attending out of all the hospitals in C City. Do you understand?\" </p><p>\"Of course, and you have your uncle, the hospital's director, to thank for that.\" </p><p>\"You…\" Wu Xiaoxue stuttered angrily, she didn't think that Huo Main would be so quick-witted. </p><p>\"I'm going to get your reports ready now. See you later, Dr. Wu.\" Huo Mian headed back to the office as soon as she finished speaking.</p><p>In all honesty, the reports weren't difficult to prepare, and it took Huo Mian less than thirty minutes to finish. Wu Xiaoxue was simply trying to give her a hard time by making her stay late. </p><p>After she was done, Huo Mian left the reports on Wu Xiaoxue's desk and went home.</p><p>Very rarely did Huo Mian get off work this early, so she made an effort and purchased vegetables and meats from the grocery store. </p><p>She then began prepping for dinner. She waited until 6:00 PM for Qin Chu, but he was still out. </p><p>Huo Mian felt a little hungry, so she ate first and left the rest of the food in the kitchen. She then went upstairs to do laundry and shower. </p><p>Qin Chu was supposed to get off work at five thirty but instead went back to his parents' residence because his father had called him.</p><p>Qin Chu's father had just come back from vacation and looked like he was in a good mood. </p><p>When Qin Chu arrived home, he was greeted by not only his parents but also a middle-aged man and his daughter. </p><p>\"Chu, this is President Liu of Tianbao Real Estate, and this is his daughter, Liu Siying.\" </p><p>When Qin Chu caught sight of Liu Siying, he was a little surprised. </p><p>Liu Siying was his high school classmate. Those who went to Second High School typically came from rich families, so he wasn't surprised that Liu Siying had a rich father. However, he was surprised that they would show up at his house today. </p><p>\"Uncle Qin, Qin Chu and I were high school classmates.\" Liu Siying smiled. </p><p>She wore a light pink dress with her hair up in a ponytail, making her look much like a teenager. Even the way she spoke sounded unusually soft and feminine. </p><p>Qin Chu glanced at the pair but didn't say anything. </p><p>\"Ha, really? What a coincidence that you two were classmates!\" Qin Chu's father looked delighted at the news. </p><p>\"Siying mentioned to me a long time ago that your son is a very fine-looking man,\" Liu Siying's father praised Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Dinner is ready, come and sit!\" Qin Chu's mother smiled. </p><p>- In the dining room - </p><p>The Qin family of three, Liu Siying, and her father all sat together, the five them forming a circle. </p><p>Liu Siying sat next to Qin Chu, her eyes full of adoration when she looked at him. </p><p>She had had a crush on Qin Chu since high school. If it weren't for Huo Mian, she thought, surely she would have become Qin Chu's girlfriend a long time ago.  </p><p>\"GK's been doing very well. You're so amazing!\" Liu Siying complimented. </p><p>\"Thanks.\" Qin Chu's face was expressionless. He didn't take a single bite of food and looked severely stone-faced. </p><p>\"Why aren't you eating, Chu? Do you not like the food?\" Qin Chu's mother asked. </p><p>\"Dad, did you ask me to come back because you needed to talk to me?\" Qin Chu was a little impatient. </p><p>\"I didn't, I just wanted you to have dinner with your Uncle Liu,\" Qin's father said slowly. </p><p>\"If that's the case, enjoy your meal. I have things planned, so I will be leaving now,\" Qin Chu said as he got up to leave.</p><p>\"Stay where you are, right now!\" Qin Chu's father became angry; he didn't think his own son would rebel like this in front of everyone.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":109,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:35.07","Link":"Chapter-109","NameDisplay":"Chapter 109"},{"ID":18112094835601206,"Name":"Chapter 110: Fell Out","NameUnsign":"Chapter 110: Fell Out","Description":"<p>Chapter 110: Fell Out</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Qin Chu stopped midway but didn't look back.</p><p>\"You're off work now. I already asked your assistant, and he said that you have no plans tonight. What are you busy with?\" </p><p>Qin Chu responded with silence. </p><p>\"Have you been out screwing around?\" Qin's father looked more furious than ever. </p><p>Qin Chu turned his head and lifted his brows. \"Father, what do you mean by 'screwing around'?\" </p><p>\"Chu, have you been hanging with disreputable women? You can't be like those spoiled playboys who tangle themselves with women in the entertainment business. It's not good for you.\" </p><p>\"Disreputable? Is that what you think when it comes to your son's taste in women?\" Qin Chu thought it was funny. </p><p>\"Mr. Qin, I don't think your son would do things like that,\" Mr. Liu said. </p><p>\"That's right. Uncle Qin, I know Qin Chu very well. Back when we went to school, a lot of girls liked him, but he never even talked to them. Also, he's never been in media scandals either, so it's definitely not what you think,\" Liu Siying added. </p><p>\"If not, then sit down.\" </p><p>\"Dad, I'm an adult now. I have my own thoughts and things to do.\" </p><p>\"If you're an adult, then you should know what behavior is appropriate under different circumstances. For one, Uncle Liu and his daughter are here. They are guests of this house that you need to entertain. You shouldn't be running around and leaving,\" Qin Chu's father scolded. </p><p>\"They are your guests, not mine. I didn't invite them, so I shouldn't be responsible for entertaining them.\" </p><p>\"You…\" </p><p>\"Oh, Mr. Liu, it's fine. If your son's busy with other things, then don't worry about us! We shouldn't give our children a hard time.\" </p><p>\"Yes, stop giving our son a hard time. Siying, go send Chu off. You were classmates, so you guys should have lots to talk about.\" Qin's mother loved her son dearly and didn't want to give him a hard time. At the same time, however, she wanted to create an opportunity for his son and the socialite. </p><p>\"Okay, Auntie Qin. I will go and send him off.\" Liu Siying smiled and got up immediately. </p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Chu walked out. He was not going to fight his father. </p><p>Liu Siying jogged to catch up with Qin Chu, who was already out the door. </p><p>Qin Chu walked up to his Maybach, opened the door, and got into the car. </p><p>Liu Siying stood beside the car window. She was so excited at that second that she didn't know what to say. </p><p>\"What do you want?\" Qin Chu frowned.</p><p>\"Qin Chu… I've liked you for a very long time.\" Liu Siying thought that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If somethings were left unsaid, then she would never have a chance. This was the perfect time to express her feelings, or so she thought. </p><p>\"So?\" Qin Chu continued to ask. </p><p>\"So, I wanted to ask you, can you be my boyfriend?\" Liu Siying was a little nervous. She lowered her head and her hands clutched the corners of her dress tightly. </p><p>\"That's very ambitious of you.\" Qin Chu glared at her without much emotion. </p><p>\"I don't want to miss the opportunity. You've been in my heart all these years.\" </p><p>\"You think I should like you because you like me?\" </p><p>\"No…\" Liu Siying waved her hands immediately. </p><p>\"It's a joke if you really think that way. I will only ever like one person in my life, from the beginning until the day I die. So, take your feelings elsewhere, they're no good on me. You're not ugly, and your family is wealthy. There is plenty of fish in the sea, so stop wasting time with me. Also, don't even think about using our fathers as a way to get what you want. GK doesn't need an arranged marriage to flourish because your family will never have more money than mine. What I need is the woman I love.\" </p><p>\"Even if that woman doesn't love you back?\" Liu Siying asked suddenly. </p><p>She felt like Huo Mian no longer had any emotions for Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Being in love with her is my business, and our relationship doesn't have room for a third person. Quit your stupidity and don't force me to tell you the hard way. That's all I have to say.\" </p><p>Qin Chu rolled up his car window as his engine roared to life. He left with lightning speed. </p><p>Liu Siying's eyes lingered in the direction the car disappeared to, her eyes sad and gloomy. </p><p>In her heart, Qin Chu was an untouchable god. Regardless of how pretty or outstanding she was, she knew that Qin Chu would never glance at her. </p><p>Qin Chu loved Huo Mian more than his own life, even though she was ill-tempered, poor, and average looking. </p><p>She felt like her jealousy was driving her insane. </p><p>By the time Qin Chu arrived back at Imperial Park, it was half past seven. </p><p>Huo Mian was watching a TV show on the couch. </p><p>\"You're home.\" She stood up after she heard the door open. </p><p>\"Is there any food?\" </p><p>\"Um… Yes.\" </p><p>\"I'm starving,\" Qin Chu tiredly mumbled as he took off his blazer and his shoes. </p><p>\"The food is a little cold now, I will go heat it up.\" Huo Mian walked towards the kitchen.</p><p>As she was passing Qin Chu, he suddenly hugged her from behind.</p><p>Huo Mian's heart shook as the sudden movement frightened her.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":110,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:35.603","Link":"Chapter-110","NameDisplay":"Chapter 110"},{"ID":181120948361789824,"Name":"Chapter 111: Embrace","NameUnsign":"Chapter 111: Embrace","Description":"<p>Chapter 111: Embrace</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Don't move. Just let me hug you for a bit.\" Qin Chu's voice was soft. Not knowing what to do, Huo Mian stood still.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, did something happen?\" She felt like something was wrong. </p><p>Someone as cold and arrogant as him would never act out like this.  </p><p>\"Nothing, I'm just a little tired and wanted to hug you.\" </p><p>Huo Mian wore a cute set of loose yellow pajamas that were covered in a Spongebob pattern. </p><p>Her hair was pulled up loosely, looking a little puffy and messy. </p><p>On the other hand, Qin Chu wore a dark purple dress shirt with expensive diamond cufflinks. </p><p>He stood behind her and hugged her quietly, greedily inhaling in her unique scent. </p><p>Immediately, his agitated heart felt calm. </p><p>The world was better with Huo Mian by his side. </p><p>\"Mian, you will be by my side like this forever, right?\" he suddenly asked. </p><p>Huo Mian opened her mouth but didn't know how to answer. </p><p>Should she answer 'yes'? Well, that would be a lie. Growing old with Qin Chu was not something that had ever crossed her mind. </p><p>There were too many external factors and psychological burdens between them. </p><p>Uncle Jing's death alone would have caused her never to be able to settle down with Qin Chu peacefully. </p><p>What if she straight-up answered 'no'? She didn't have the heart to do it. At this moment in time, Qin Chu seemed fragile.</p><p>So, she replied with silence.</p><p>After a while, Qin Chu let Huo Mian go slowly and sat down on the couch. </p><p>He took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it. The expression in his eyes was too difficult to understand.  </p><p>To Qin Chu, Liu Siying and her father were nothing more than strangers, so he didn't need to be polite. </p><p>But there was one thing that Liu Siying said that stung his heart. </p><p>She asked him if it mattered that the person he liked didn't like him back. </p><p>This was the one thing Qin Chu cared about the most. He knew without a doubt that the Huo Mian from seven years ago loved him. </p><p>But who was to say that things were still the same seven years later? </p><p>Seven years can change many things, even if Huo Mian never dated Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p>That didn't mean that she was still in love with Qin Chu. After all, it was him that brought the misfortunes onto her family. </p><p>He couldn't possibly seek revenge on his parents, even though they were the ones who hurt Huo Mian.</p><p>It was definitely not a good feeling when you are able to be with the woman you love every day, but couldn't confirm if she feels the same way. </p><p>He felt almost like an insecure child who was always frightened by the thought of abandonment. </p><p>Huo Mian reheated the leftovers in the kitchen and brought them to the table. </p><p>Qin Chu looked much more energetic after a cigarette. He changed into a white shirt. </p><p>\"I just whipped up something randomly, try them. I'm not very good at cooking.\" Huo Mian pointed to the dishes without much confidence. </p><p>Qin Chu sat down quietly and took a bite of bok choy. </p><p>Stir-fried bok choy, cucumbers and egg, dry-fried yellow croaker, and a ]seafood soup. </p><p>Most of the dishes were vegetarian since Huo Mian didn't like eating meat. She wondered if the food would suit Qin Chu's appetite.</p><p>Huo Mian sat on the side and watched him eat, and for the first time, she felt comfortable with him. </p><p>The way Qin Chu ate was very graceful, and when he lowered his head, you could see his long lashes. </p><p>Huo Mian sat there with her chin on her hands and watched this man eat. She was overly concentrated as if she were watching a TV drama. </p><p>She almost forgot how pathetic her stare was. </p><p>\"You like what you're seeing?\" Qin Chu asked suddenly without looking at Huo Mian. </p><p>Snapping back to reality, Huo Mian awkwardly coughed and got up immediately. </p><p>\"Um… you can leave everything here once you're done. I will come and clean it up, I'm going upstairs to take a shower now.\" </p><p>Huo Mian then ran up the stairs. </p><p>An hour later, she came down after her shower and noticed that the dining table was already cleared. </p><p>The dishes and bowls had been thoroughly washed as well. </p><p>Huo Mian was happy. Unlike other chauvinistic men, Qin Chu didn't think chores were solely a woman's responsibility.</p><p>In fact, Qin Chu simply didn't want Huo Mian to be bogged down by miscellaneous chores. </p><p>At this time, Qin Chu was already in the study, organizing company data. </p><p>Huo Mian went back upstairs as she walked around and realized there were no other chores to be done. </p><p>- Late at night - </p><p>Qin Chu opened the bedroom door to see Huo Mian deep asleep. </p><p>Gently, he walked up to the bed and rolled onto it, held her, and laid down beside her. </p><p>Through the moonlight that shined through the window, he stared at her delicate and pretty face. </p><p>\"You like what you're seeing?\" She suddenly opened her eyes and asked him with a sweet smile on her face.</p><p>Qin Chu was startled.

He held onto Huo Mian's hand tightly and felt his heart fill with happiness. </p><p>- Next Morning - </p><p>Huo Mian woke up early as usual to make breakfast. </p><p>A bowl of vegetable congee, several milk-steamed buns, and a glass of soymilk were ready for Qin Chu as soon as he arrived downstairs. </p><p>\"We can find a maid, this is too much trouble for you,\" Qin Chu said as he ate. </p><p>\"What's troubling about making breakfast? It's not tiring at all. Besides, there's only the two of us, it's inconvenient to have an outsider here. I can do chores when I'm bored and have nothing to do.\" Huo Mian smiled. </p><p>Qin Chu fell silent. </p><p>\"Um, can I talk to you about something?\" Huo Mian asked hesitantly. </p><p>\"What is it?\" </p><p>\"Can you stop depositing your salary into my bank account?\" </p><p>\"Why?\" </p><p>\"It's too much,\" Huo Mian complained. </p><p>\"But you're my wife, who am I supposed to give my salary if not to you?\" Qin Chu said as if it was the only logical thing to do.</p><p>\"You can keep it for yourself.\" </p><p>\"You think I need money?\" Qin Chu furrowed his brows slightly. </p><p>\"No, I just think it's too much money. It's not a good idea to keep it with me.\" </p><p>\"I think it's a good idea,\" Qin Chu said stubbornly. </p><p>Huo Mian 0, Qin Chu 1. </p><p>Qin Chu knew Huo Mian would never ask for money, so it was only natural to deposit his money into her account. </p><p>It was a million yuan each month; she would never be able to spend it all, even if she wanted to. </p><p>Huo Mian was not someone who was luxurious in nature. </p><p>She wanted to tell Qin Chu to stop, but Qin Chu never took her seriously. </p><p>She lost the negotiation and decided that she would have to come up with another way. </p><p>When they left for work, as usual, Qin Chu drove the Maybach and dropped Huo Mian off five hundred meters away from the hospital's main entrance. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, you're late,\" Wu Xiaoxue watched Huo Mian walk in and immediately began scolding her. </p><p>\"I'm not late,\" Huo Mian replied as she buckled up her lab coat.  </p><p>\"Do you know how busy the OB/GYN department is? Can't you arrive a little earlier? You're so unprofessional! People like you will only ever be good enough to be a nurse,\" Wu Xiaoxue cursed, her voice filled with contempt and disdain. </p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with being a nurse, it's what I want to do.\" Huo Mian smiled slightly. </p><p>\"Don't be clever or else I swear I'm going to make your life hell. I'm telling you, I'm very strict. You work under me, and I do not tolerate mistakes. Or else, I will fire you immediately.\" </p><p>\"I'll try my best,\" Huo Mian answered in a nonchalant manner.  </p><p>\"Follow me to the OR! We need to perform a C-section later.\" Wu Xiaoxue glared at her and began walking towards the OR with a patient's file.</p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>Huo Mian followed Wu Xiaoxue all the way to the OR. </p><p>A C-Section sounded scary, but really, it was nothing more than a small surgery. It took less than an hour to complete.</p><p>Huo Mian had to admit that Wu Xiaoxue was very skilled.</p><p>She sewed up the patient, and the rest was left for Huo Mian to finish. </p><p>Huo Mian was out of breath from putting things back in order but Wu Xiaoxue had caught her and began yelling before she even had the chance to have a glass of water, \"Why are you here? Did you even clean up the OR?\" </p><p>\"That's not my responsibility, the cleanup crew will have the place sanitized.\"</p><p>\"This is the OB/GYN's OR, and you're a part of our department. Shouldn't you go and help? Did you think you were being paid to do nothing? Our hospital doesn't hire useless people.\"</p><p>\"Dr. Wu, it's fine if you want to direct things at me, but don't you think you're going a little overboard?

Plus, you are abusing your powers to get even with another person due to a private grudge, all because I am your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend?\" Huo Mian glared at her angrily. Clearly, this had been bugging her for a while. </p><p>\"You…?\" Wu Xiaoxue choked on her own words after hearing what Huo Mian said. </p><p>But in all honesty, what Huo Mian said was true. She was, in fact, abusing her power. </p><p>A couple of nurse bystanders began to whisper amongst themselves, which made Wu Xiaoxue a little embarrassed. </p><p>\"What are you all looking at? Do you guys not have work? Get out of here,\" Wu Xiaoxue looked at the nurses and cursed at them impolitely. </p><p>Huang Yue hurried up and pulled Huo Mian away from the scene as well. </p><p>\"Mian, don't be so angry. Wu Xiaoxue is a spoiled princess. She grew up with a serious sense of superiority and made you her imaginary enemy. He Man probably trash-talked you behind your back, and that's why she's treating you like this. He Man was looking for Wu Xiaoxue yesterday. I'm not sure what she said to Wu Xiaoxue, but she's the kind of woman who wants to watch the world burn.\" </p><p>\"I don't care what they talked about. I just can't stand the way Wu Xiaoxue does things. It's just a job, so worse comes worst, I can quit. I don't need to be bullied every day. Head Nurse is also very strict, but at least she is professional. It's over the line for Wu Xiaoxue to abuse her powers like this, I will not have it. A reasonable counterattack is a form of self-protection,\" Huo Mian spoke in assurance. </p><p>Huang Yue nodded in agreement, \"Mian, I think you're right. Just because she's the hospital director's niece, it doesn't mean she can do whatever she wants. I can't believe she actually thinks that she is a princess. Look at all her spoiled bad habits. I'm with you on this one. If you really find it hard to bear, you don't have to quit. You can request to be transferred. I heard that South Side Recuperation Center is hiring right now, and you get paid more. However, the job is a little demanding. You know, millionaires reside there for recovery, and they're difficult to deal with.\" </p><p>\"It's fine. No point in thinking so much. We'll take it one step at a time.\" Huo Mian shook her head. </p><p>The OB/GYN department's been in pandemonium ever since Wu Xiaoxue was transferred over. Not only was Huo Mian sticking out like a sore thumb, but the other nurses were also tortured by Wu Xiaoxue as well. Everyone's been secretly complaining, and even the head nurse was getting worried.</p><p>The head nurse then proceeded to speak with Huo Mian in private. She hoped that Huo Mian could adjust her priorities and ensure her private grudges with Wu Xiaoxue will not affect her job. Huo Mian agreed, but, deep down, she was annoyed.</p><p>In the afternoon, Huo Mian checked on a couple of patients, took their temperatures, and gave them their IVs. </p><p>As soon as she got back to the clinic, Wu Xiaoxue walked towards her angrily. </p><p>\"Huo Mian!\" she yelled out impolitely. </p><p>\"What is it now?\" Huo Mian knew that nothing good would come out of this.</p><p>\"You didn't listen to me when I told you to sterilize the OR in the morning. The patient who used the OR afterward is now infected. They're looking for the person that is to be held responsible. You're in big trouble now.\" Wu Xiaoxue narrowed her brows. </p><p>\"Why am I in trouble? What does incomplete sterilization have anything to do with me? That's the cleanup crew's issue. Infection after surgery could also be the surgeon's problem. Why would it be a nurse's issue?\" Huo Main refuted coldly.</p><p>Did Wu Xiaoxue really think she was an idiot that didn't know these basic facts?</p><p>\"It's everyone's responsibility, and don't think you can get away with it. I will be escalating this issue for sure. The people in the cleaning crew, the surgeon for the second surgery, and an irresponsible nurse like you will all have to get the hell out.\"</p><p>\"Are you kidding me, Dr. Wu? Don't stretch the truth. If you really dislike me, I recommend you speak directly to that hospital director uncle of yours. Just tell him that I'm your boyfriend's ex and that you can't stand looking at me. Just fire me, why go through the trouble of pushing responsibilities onto me and affecting all those people?

She was almost too quick-witted for her to keep up with. </p><p>\"If you thought I'd be easy to deal with, you are dead wrong. The reality is, I'm not that easy to topple,\" Huo Mian taunted Wu Xiaoxue. Then, she turned on her heel and left. </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue was left pale with rage... </p><p>Originally, Wu Xiaoxue hadn't actually held too much animosity toward Huo Mian. However, He Man's repeated hinting had indeed fanned the flames of her displeasure towards Huo Mian. Although she knew that He Man was a bad egg, her words still affected her. </p><p>He Man said that Ning Zhiyuan really loved Huo Mian, and that he had once spent several years courting her. </p><p>She also said that Ning Zhiyuan's new apartment was originally bought so that he and Huo Mian could get married.</p><p>She also said that Ning Zhiyuan's parents loved Huo Mian like she was their own daughter. </p><p>Finally, He Man stressed that, although they weren't together anymore, Huo Mian was still a very important woman in Ning Zhiyuan's life. </p><p>A woman's jealousy was a terrible thing, and Wu Xiaoxue was not a level-headed woman to begin with. </p><p>Therefore, under He Man's prodding, when she had next encountered Huo Mian, she treated her as an arch nemesis. </p><p>She really liked Ning Zhiyuan. Although he wasn't much of a sweet-talker, Ning Zhiyuan was very talented. </p><p>She had read Ning Zhiyuan's academic papers before and found that they were exceptional. During a hospital meeting, the director of the hospital had specifically praised Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>That wasn't all. A short while back, one of Ning Zhiyuan's optometry treatment plans had gained the attention of a medical institute abroad and he was invited to study there. She had begun worshipping him because of this. </p><p>In addition, Ning Zhiyuan didn't act clingy around her. This further stoked her interest towards him. </p><p>Throwing caution to the wind, she had moved into Ning Zhiyuan's apartment and even met his parents. </p><p>Although the elderly couple didn't seem to like her much, she was confident she could make Ning Zhiyuan marry her. </p><p>- Outside the Optometry Clinic - </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue leaned against the doorframe, watching Ning Zhiyuan take a call in his office. </p><p>Then, he hung up the phone and saw her. He got up and walked over. \"Why are you here?\" </p><p>\"Ah, I'm not really busy today, so I came to see you.\" </p><p>\"Oh, come in. Have a seat.\" Ning Zhiyuan smiled. </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue wrapped her arms around Ning Zhiyuan's neck flirtingly. \"Zhiyuan, let's get married.\" </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was caught by surprise. He hadn't thought about this before. </p><p>For him, dating Wu Xiaoxue was purely an accident. After he and Huo Mian broke up, he had been quite down. He Man's novelty had also worn off. That was why he had driven to the bar to get drunk after work. </p><p>Unexpectedly, he ran into Wu Xiaoxue, who, upon recognizing him, came over to drink with him. </p><p>By the end, both of them were drunk. Naturally, certain things happened. </p><p>He had thought that she would just be a one-night stand. To his surprise, however, Wu Xiaoxue stuck onto him like glue and even drove to his new home on her own accord. </p><p>After some thought, he figured that Wu Xiaoxue was, after all, the Director's niece. Being with her would benefit his career. </p><p>With that, Ning Zhiyuan kicked He Man to the curb with record speed and latched onto Wu Xiaoxue. This made him the hottest topic of gossip at the hospital. </p><p>However, dating was one thing. He really hadn't thought about marriage at all. </p><p>Right now, he only wanted to become an attending. Then, he would continue his climb upward, ultimately toppling his department chief and taking his place. </p><p>\"What's with that expression. Don't you want to?\" Seeing his expression, Wu Xiaoxue was obviously displeased. </p><p>\"No, that's not it.\" </p><p>\"Then why the long face? You don't look happy at all.\" </p><p>\"I'm just not prepared for marriage.\" </p><p>\"But I'm pregnant,\" Wu Xiaoxue whined.</p><p>\"What?\" Ning Zhiyuan instantly felt his mind go blank.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":114,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:37.747","Link":"Chapter-114","NameDisplay":"Chapter 114"},{"ID":181120948383111362,"Name":"Chapter 115: Gloating","NameUnsign":"Chapter 115: Gloating","Description":"<p>Chapter 115: Gloating</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I said, I'm pregnant,\" Wu Xiaoxue repeated. </p><p>\"Are you kidding?\" Ning Zhiyuan gave a dry laugh. </p><p>\"Of course not. Why would I joke about something like that? I didn't think this would happen either. I did take birth control. Maybe this baby is just too lucky.\"</p><p>\"But… I feel like it's all happening too suddenly.\" </p><p>At this, Wu Xiaoxue's face fell. She shoved Ning Zhiyuan away. </p><p>\"What is that supposed to mean? You want me to get rid of it? I'm telling you, I won't get an abortion. It's not good for my health. I'm an OB/GYN doctor so I know this better than anyone.\" </p><p>\"That's not what I meant. Calm down.\" </p><p>\"I can't calm down. Ning Zhiyuan, just tell me this, are you going to marry me or not? If you still can't let Huo Mian go, then go find her. I'll let you two be together.\" </p><p>\"Xiaoxue, what does this have to do with Huo Mian?\" Ning Zhiyuan replied, exasperated. </p><p>\"Don't think that I didn't know that you're still hung up on that woman.\" </p><p>\"No, you're overthinking it. Huo Mian and I broke up a long time ago.\" </p><p>\"Then why won't you marry me?\" Wu Xiaoxue pressed.</p><p>\"I just feel like I'm not good enough. I'm just an intern right now, and my home was bought on a mortgage. I'm scared I won't be able to give you and our child a good life financially. Do you understand?\" </p><p>Hearing him put it this way, Wu Xiaoxue's attitude immediately changed. She smiled, \"I wouldn't look down on you because of that, Zhiyuan. I already have a condo and a car. My parents bought them for me. After we get married, you can come live at my place. You can save that place of yours for your parents. Your car, too. We'll get you a new one. My dad said he'll get you a Mercedes-Benz GLK. Also, you don't have to worry about your job at all. I'll go and talk to my uncle later and get you a permanent position right away. You can be in charge of the first Optometry Clinic.\"  </p><p>Everything Ning Zhiyuan had dreamed of could be made a reality with one simple statement from Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>He suddenly realized that it was true what people said: get a rich wife, and you can be spared at least ten years of toiling. </p><p>\"Why aren't you saying anything?\" Wu Xiaoxue asked. </p><p>\"It's nothing. I'm just a little embarrassed to ask you to help with everything. I'll look down on myself.\" </p><p>\"Zhiyuan, don't overthink it. You're outstanding, and these things should be yours anyway. Did you know, I really admire you. You were born to be a prodigy in the optometry field. I read all of your academic papers and they are amazing. Even my uncle said you're a talented man, and you are sure to do great things in the future.\" </p><p>Hearing Wu Xiaoxue mentioning this, Ning Zhiyuan's sense of unease grew. </p><p>This was because none of those acclaimed academic papers were written by him. Huo Mian had written all of them for him in the past. </p><p>Now that Huo Mian was no longer by his side, he wouldn't be able to produce any new material. He could only rely on the articles from before to attract people's attention. </p><p>\"Zhiyuan?\" </p><p>\"Uh huh?\" </p><p>\"What do you think about my suggestion? Let's get married. What do you think?\" </p><p>Ning Zhiyuan paused for a moment. \"Okay,\" he squeezed out from between his teeth. </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue's expression instantly brightened. She hugged Ning Zhiyuan's neck tightly. </p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to get off work, she received a WeChat message on her phone. </p><p>It was from Zhu Lingling. The message said, \"Mian, go check our high school classmates group.\" </p><p>To prevent herself from being distracted on the job, Huo Mian had turned off all group notifications. Unless she checked the groups manually, she wouldn't know about anything new that happened there. With Zhu Lingling's prompt, she immediately opened the group chat window for her high school classmates.</p><p>There, she saw a photo. It was of Qin Chu, sitting by a dining table. </p><p>The one who uploaded the photo was Liu Siying....</p><p>After the photo was uploaded, her classmates immediately exploded with questions. </p><p>\"Ying, what's going on? Are you and Qin Chu dating?\" </p><p>\"Ying, when did you have dinner with Mr. Hottie Qin? Why didn't you invite me? Meanie.\" </p><p>\"You're amazing, Liu Siying. How did you get Qin Chu to go out with you? That's no simple feat.\" </p><p>Of course, they were all kissing up to her...</p><p>On the other hand, Zhu Lingling replied with the following, \"Did you take this photo yourself?

She tagged Zhu Lingling and answered, \"I was at Qin Chu's house last night. My father and I paid his parents a visit and he happened to be there as well, so we had dinner together. Do you really think that I'm bored enough to steal someone else's photo?\"</p><p>\"Oh, I see, so it's a business partnership,\" Zhu Lingling replied.</p><p>Everyone knew that Zhu Lingling was best friends with Huo Mian, so it was natural for her to act hostile towards Liu Siying.</p><p>\"It wasn't a partnership; my father wasn't there on business. Our families are close. Qin Chu's new car is awesome, and he even took me on a ride with him.\"</p><p>\"I'll believe it if I see it,\" Zhu Lingling replied coldly.</p><p>\"I'm not going to send you all the photos. After all, it's a private thing between me and Qin Chu,\" Liu Siying gloated.</p><p>Huo Mian felt uncomfortable at the sight of this…</p><p>Last night, Qin Chu came home late, and he looked weird when he did…</p><p>Was it because he took Liu Siying on a ride in his car…?</p><p>As Huo Mian was lost in thought, Zhu Lingling shot over a WeChat message. She asked, \"Mian, is what she said true? Did Qin Chu really have dinner with her? That woman's disgusting.\"</p><p>\"I don't know either, I never ask Qin Chu regarding his whereabouts.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean? Aren't you guys married?\" Zhu Lingling asked.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled bitterly and replied to her via voice message, \"You know our relationship, we're not the lovey-dovey kind. Anyways, it's weird.\"</p><p>\"You need to keep him on a tight leash! Aren't you afraid that someone will steal him from you? Qin Chu's quite a catch.\"</p><p>\"I can't do anything about it. If something like that really happens, then I'll have an excuse to get divorced. It'll work out nicely.\"</p><p>\"Mian, is that what you really want?\"</p><p>\"Lingling, let's forget about him. Let's talk about you. I haven't seen you in days, and I miss you already! Let's go out for food.\"</p><p>\"Sounds good, I'll make reservations. What do you want to eat?\" Zhu Lingling agreed right away.</p><p>\"It's my treat today, so you pick the place.\"</p><p>\"Awesome, Mrs. Moneybags! I'll see you in a bit.\"</p><p>Huo Mian put down her phone and began changing. As she was leaving the hospital, Zhu Lingling sent her the location of the restaurant.</p><p>- The Seafood Restaurant at Hilton Hotel -</p><p>Huo Mian took a cab there and arrived at the same time as Zhu Lingling.</p><p>\"Mrs. Moneybags, I plan on eating you poor today.\"</p><p>\"Sounds good, eat as much as you can.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"Qin Chu treats you well, he provides you with an endless cash flow!\" Zhu Lingling exclaimed.</p><p>\"His monthly salary is transferred onto my card. Although I didn't earn that money, I don't think he'll mind me spending a little bit of it here and there.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>She and Zhu Lingling were both seafood lovers. In the past, she was poor so Lingling always treated her.</p><p>Now that she had money, she was going to pay her best friend back by treating her to a big feast.</p><p>They ordered a giant platter with all kinds of seafood. In the middle of the platter was a 4-pound Australian lobster.</p><p>Huo Mian and Zhu Lingling both dug into it in unison, too busy eating to engage in small talk.</p><p>After their stomachs were stuffed with seafood and wine, Huo Mian wiped the corners of her mouth and asked, \"What's going on with you? We haven't talked in a while, have you been busy? Are you still selling stuff online?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm not. I've been busy being in a relationship.\"</p><p>\"A relationship? You have a new boyfriend?\" smiling, Huo Mian looked up and asked curiously.</p><p>Zhu Lingling laughed mysteriously, \"Oh yeah, and I like him a lot. But now's not the time for you to meet him. Once we go public with our relationship, I'll tell you everything.\"</p><p>\"Okay then, good luck on your relationship.\" Huo Mian held up her wine glass.</p><p>\"Thanks, Goddess Mian.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's heart sank a bit when she saw the bill…</p><p>Although she had already anticipated that it would be an expensive meal, 39,800 yuan was a little over the top, and it shocked her…</p><p>\"What, are you regretting now?\" Zhu Lingling nudged her elbow.</p><p>\"Maybe if I were treating someone else, but definitely not you. I just think that we've been ripped off. This meal wasn't worth that much. Do you know how much we could buy with 30,000 yuan at the seafood market? We'd be able to buy a couple giant buckets of shrimp.\"</p><p>\"Haha, that's not the same. This is the Hilton Hotel, Miss Huo.\" Zhu Lingling laughed.</p><p>After leaving the hotel, Huo Mian got onto Zhu Lingling's car.</p><p>Zhu Lingling drove a red Mazda Atenza. Huo Mian used to joke that it was a typical homewrecker car.</p><p>That's because it was a popular car and everyone was driving it, especially young women.</p><p>However, with Zhu Lingling's monthly salary of 15,000 yuan, this car was luxurious enough.</p><p>\"Mian, I hate that bitch Liu Siying, can you think of a way to make her life hell?\"</p><p>\"Um… how?\"</p><p>\"You can upload your marriage certificate to our group, then she'll have nothing else to say.\" Zhu Lingling smiled evilly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":116,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:38.833","Link":"Chapter-116","NameDisplay":"Chapter 116"},{"ID":18112094839265075,"Name":"Chapter 117: Self-Abuse","NameUnsign":"Chapter 117: Self-Abuse","Description":"<p>Chapter 117: Self-Abuse</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I don't think that's a good idea.

Technically, she can't really blame Qin Chu for what happened, since he was already abroad by then. His god-damn parents committed the crime, and it had nothing to do with Qin Chu.

You shouldn't burden yourself too much.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling drove Huo Mian to the entrance of Imperial Park.</p><p>After a heart-to-heart, they said goodbye to each other, and Zhu Lingling drove away.</p><p>As Huo Mian headed into the residential district, she casually took out her phone, and was immediately shocked by what she saw…</p><p>In her high school group chat, Qin Chu, who had never participated in any of their conversations, sent, \"I had dinner with Huo Mian last night.\"</p><p>This one sentence blew the chat up like a bomb.</p><p>\"Huh? Didn't Siying say she had dinner with you? She even sent us a photo.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, did she photoshop that photo?\"</p><p>\"The man-in-question already denied it!

If she had known, she wouldn't have made a fool out of herself with that photo.</p><p>At this thought, Liu Siying added Qin Chu as a friend; in the greeting message, she wrote, \"I'm sorry, please forgive me.\"</p><p>Qin Chu just ignored her and exited the group chat.</p><p>When he was added to the group, all he cared about was what Huo Mian was up to.</p><p>Now that she was by his side, he was no longer interested in that group…</p><p>After Qin Chu left the group chat, his classmates began making assumptions…</p><p>The gossipiest of people tagged Huo Mian and asked her, \"What's going on?\"</p><p>Not knowing how to reply, Huo Mian decided that it would be easier to just exit the group chat as well.</p><p>Truth be told, aside from Zhu Lingling, she wasn't close to anyone else in that group.</p><p>Especially after what happened with Wei Dong, things became more awkward for her.</p><p>Now that Qin Chu had left the group, he had created a perfect opportunity for her to leave it as well.</p><p>When Huo Mian opened the door to their condo, she saw Qin Chu standing by the living room window, with a glass of red wine in his hand.</p><p>\"You're home,\" she casually said.</p><p>\"I went home last night. Liu Siying and her dad were there. I was with them for a little bit but didn't have dinner. I had dinner here. I also didn't take her out for a drive.\"</p><p>She was surprised that Qin Chu explained everything that happened last night; he was obviously aware of what was happening on WeChat.</p><p>\"Oh.\" Huo Mian nodded, acknowledging that she understood.</p><p>Qin Chu turned around to place the empty glass of wine by the wine cabinet and walked towards Huo Mian.</p><p>Then, he picked up a box on the coffee table and handed it to her.</p><p>\"What's this?\"</p><p>\"I bought this for you.\" Then, Qin Chu turned around and went upstairs.</p><p>Huo Mian wanted to decline it, but he was already gone.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":117,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:39.267","Link":"Chapter-117","NameDisplay":"Chapter 117"},{"ID":181120948398176105,"Name":"Chapter 118: Present","NameUnsign":"Chapter 118: Present","Description":"<p>Chapter 118: Present</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian slowly opened the rectangular gift box to see a brand new, rose gold iPhone 6S.</p><p>So it was a phone... </p><p>Huo Mian looked down at her fairly old iPhone 4S; it was the phone her brother Zhixing had used before her. </p><p>She had given Zhixing a new iPhone 5, so Zhixing gave this black 4S to Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian thought it worked very well, so she had been using it for quite some time. </p><p>She didn't know that Qin Chu was aware of all of this and would buy her a new iPhone. </p><p>She thought she shouldn't accept it; however, if she refused, she might seem too picky.</p><p>She had already accepted Qin Chu's one-million-yuan monthly salary, so should she really be hesitating whether to accept a phone, which was only worth a few thousand yuan? </p><p>At this thought, Huo Mian brought the phone back into her room and then took out the sim card. </p><p>She replaced her old phone with the new one... </p><p>Then, to try out the camera, she even took a selfie on her bed. </p><p>However, she had no clue that this phone's ICloud was already linked to Qin Chu's phone. </p><p>This meant that every photo she took on her phone would automatically show up on Qin Chu's phone. </p><p>So, Mr. Qin, who was sitting in the other room, saw Huo Mian's silly selfie in her pajamas.</p><p>The corners of his lips curled into a smile… </p><p>Huo Mian then logged onto WeChat, and saw that someone had sent her a friend request.</p><p>She clicked on the request and saw that it was Qin Chu. </p><p>She tapped on 'approve', adding him to her contacts. </p><p>Her first words were to ask, \"How did you find my WeChat account?\" </p><p>To her surprise, Qin Chu immediately replied, \"We were in the same WeChat group.\"</p><p>Oh true. </p><p>Just then, she received another WeChat notification. </p><p>Qin Chu sent her a money transfer, it was 8888 yuan. </p><p>Huo Mian tapped on accept, and then replied, \"Thanks.\" </p><p>Qin Chu never replied... </p><p>- The next morning - </p><p>When they were eating breakfast, Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu, and said, \"I'll be taking night shifts starting this week, so I won't be back at night.\" </p><p>\"Why are you taking night shifts?\" Qin Chu's furrowed his brows, clearly upset.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled unwillingly, \"I don't want to either, but it's the hospital's policy.\" </p><p>\"I can call Wu Zhongxing and ask him to cancel your night shifts.\" </p><p>\"No, don't do that. If the director really moved me to the day shift, the other colleagues would have to take the night shifts.

Was the head nurse trying to set her up with a potential boyfriend?</p><p>That's why the head nurse wanted her to change? So she could go on a date?</p><p>However, was it really okay for a married woman like her to go on dates? </p><p>At this thought, Huo Mian wanted to confess everything and tell her the truth, since lying wasn't a very good trait. </p><p>Therefore, she opened her mouth, and said, \"Head Nurse, the thing is that… I think you might have misunderstood, the truth is that I'm...\" </p><p>Before she said the word 'married', the head nurse cut her off and said, \"Go to the cafe downstairs, he's sitting by the window. He'll be the young man in white, go on, that's it.\" </p><p>\"Head Nurse, the patient in room five's water broke! Come quickly, she needs surgery!\" one of the nurses shouted in a hurry. </p><p>\"Okay, I'll be right over!\" Then, the head nurse patted Huo Mian's shoulder, and encouraged, \"Go, you can do it.\" </p><p>\"Huh? Head Nurse, I haven't finished yet,\" Huo Mian's face was filled with indecision. </p><p>However, the head nurse was already long gone… </p><p>If she didn't go, then it might be impolite for the other person to sit around and wait. </p><p>Huo Mian decided to suck it up and meet the head nurse's \"exceptional\" cousin; she would clearly explain her situation to him face to face. </p><p>After she took off her white lab coat, Huo Mian put on a mickey-mouse printed yellow t-shirt with light blue jeans. </p><p>She didn't even have time to tie up her hair, just letting it fall freely and carelessly. </p><p>It was only early summer, so it wasn't that hot yet, and the occasional cold breeze would blow by.</p><p>After Huo Mian took a deep breath, she stepped into the café where they were to meet. </p><p>She immediately saw the young man seated near the window. He was wearing a white shirt and sat very quietly in his chair. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't even know what his name was. She only came because the head nurse had arranged this, and she couldn't let her down. </p><p>\"Hi, the head nurse told me to meet you here,\" Huo Mian built up her courage, walked over, and greeted him. </p><p>The man turned around; after he looked at Huo Mian, he gave a small nod, \"Hi, please sit down.\" </p><p>Huo Mian sat down across from him. </p><p>\"What would you like to drink?\" </p><p>\"Just water is fine.\" Huo Mian awkwardly smiled. </p><p>\"Waitress, she would like a glass of lemon water.\" He ordered.</p><p>The man looked at Huo Mian again and closely inspected her facial features and choice of clothes. </p><p>He then slowly said, \"My cousin told you what I do for a living, right?\" </p><p>\"Yes, she did. You work in forensics.\" </p><p>\"Yes, I am a forensics specialist hired by the police bureau. I studied in the United States and majored in Forensics at the University of Maryland. I'm now the youngest forensics Ph.D. in our province.\" </p><p>\"Would you mind telling me your name?\" Huo Mian clearly had no interest in this person's profession whatsoever; she only wanted to find out his name so that she could tell him the truth, and not lead him into any misunderstandings.</p><p>He was surprised that after the young woman across from him heard about his prestigious background, she didn't show any hint of emotions; instead, she calmly asked him for his name.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":119,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:40.387","Link":"Chapter-119","NameDisplay":"Chapter 119"},{"ID":181120948408363947,"Name":"Chapter 120: Fail","NameUnsign":"Chapter 120: Fail","Description":"<p>Chapter 120: Fail</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"My name is Lin Mingyu, Lin as in the forest, Ming as in the bright moon, and Yu as in the universe (TL note: direct translation in Chinese),\" he calmly explained. </p><p>Lin Mingyu wasn't very handsome, but his facial features were quite nice, and he was a clean-looking young man. </p><p>His white jacket was Armani's newest style, and he was wearing a Cartier ring on his index finger. </p><p>His outfit was extravagant, and he clearly didn't look like a forensics guy. But then again, never judge a book by its cover, right? </p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Huo Mian used the same way to introduce herself. </p><p>\"My name is Huo Mian, Huo as in the martial artist Huo Yuanjia, and Mian as in sleep.\"</p><p>\"Mian as in sleep? That is a rare name, why not use the 'Mian' character that means 'cotton'?\" Lin Mingyu asked out of curiosity. </p><p>\"I'm not sure either, couldn't voice my opinion at that time.\" Huo Mian felt awkward. </p><p>\"Okay, Huo Mian, what an interesting name.\" Lin Mingyu held up his coffee mug as he slightly sighed with emotion. </p><p>\"Mr. Liu, I've come here today because…\" </p><p>\"Don't worry, my cousin told me all about your situation. I heard that you graduated from a local third-rate college and are only an intern nurse at the moment. You only have a little brother and mother in your family, and they live on the outskirts of the city. Your brother is still in college, and your mother runs a small store, right?\" </p><p>\"That's right, that's basically my current family situation. The head nurse treats me very well, and I think she overestimated me. Given my conditions, I don't think that I'm worthy of a man like you, so… we're not compatible.\" </p><p>Huo Mian felt somewhat relieved when she heard Lin Mingyu bring up this topic first, since it would make things easier than having to explain to him her entire situation. </p><p>However, Lin Mingyu continued, \"I'm not a shallow man. I don't care about conditions or situations. My cousin said that you're a very good person. You do things with great effort and pay great attention to detail. I've seen your picture before, and think that you're pretty. I don't want much from my future wife, I only want her to be gentle and caring. That's it. Because I've got quite a handsome salary, you won't have to go to work at all after we get married. You just have to stay home and take care of the children. What do you think?\" </p><p>\"Uhm… I think that you're thinking too far into the future.\" Huo Mian was a bit speechless. </p><p>\"Of course not, these things can all be immediately accomplished. You might know already that because of the nature of my job, I'm very busy so I barely have any time to date. If I think that you're a good match, then we should get married immediately because I don't want us to waste each other's time. These are all very practical questions.\" </p><p>\"Everyone has their own ideas. You could say that these might be the right ones for you, but they don't match my standards. Anyways, the head nurse meant well to introduce us, so I'm very grateful towards her, and I can tell that you are an accomplished individual. However, we're not compatible. Thanks for the drink, but I should go now,\" Huo Mian stood up apologetically; she no longer wanted to continue talking to this person. </p><p>Lin Mingyu felt a bit uncomfortable when he saw Huo Mian's reaction. Did this set-up just fail? </p><p>Was he just rejected by a random little nurse? </p><p>\"Wait.\" </p><p>Huo Mian stopped in her tracks…</p><p>\"I want to know, what didn't you like about me?\" </p><p>Lin Mingyu had gone on these dates many times, and many of the girls took the initiative to contact him because he was educated overseas, his parents were senior officials, and his family background was impressive. He also drove an Audi Q5 and his annual salary was 600,000 yuan. He was perfect - a homeowner and a car owner. He didn't understand why a little intern nurse like Huo Mian from a poor family could be so pretentious.</p><p>\"Nothing, it's not you,\" Huo Mian honestly replied.</p><p>\"Then why are you leaving in such a hurry? You said that we're not compatible. Isn't that the same thing as a rejection?\" Lin Mingyu asked in a slightly upset tone.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":120,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:40.837","Link":"Chapter-120","NameDisplay":"Chapter 120"},{"ID":181120948413881613,"Name":"Chapter 121: A Bet","NameUnsign":"Chapter 121: A Bet","Description":"<p>Chapter 121: A Bet</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Rejected?

I've already stated things quite clearly. I don't mind that you don't know anything. If it's my job that's making you scared that we won't have anything in common, then I can't blame you, since forensics is indeed unique and is very difficult to learn. It's hard for regular people to communicate with me.\"</p><p>\"That's not the issue, I'm not worried about that.\" Huo Mian was an honest girl. She didn't think too much when she said this. </p><p>However, the other party paid attention to every word she said. Lin Mingyu was already quite upset. Once he heard Huo Mian, he laughed mockingly, \"Ha, what do you mean 'that's not the issue'? From the sound of it, you're quite knowledgeable, so don't blame me later on for not warning you. Forensics is a very difficult and knowledge-extensive subject. It's not a random trick that little nurses like you learn in medical school, do you understand? Don't be so pretentious. It's true that you know your own limitations, but don't you think that you're only pretending to know what you don't?\" </p><p>\"I'm not, I'm only speaking the truth,\" Huo Mian calmly explained. </p><p>\"Huh? What truth? You're a nurse who graduated from a third-rate medical school, so what truth do you know? I'm very curious.\" Lin Mingyu's tone had hints of disdain since he had always been quite proud of his professional knowledge. </p><p>In the past, he had been on dates with women from prestigious universities before. They all tried to discuss professional knowledge with him, or even tried to show-off, but they were quickly muted by his questions. </p><p>However, this little nurse, Huo Mian, was quite deliberate with her arrogant words, which greatly upset him. </p><p>\"Mr. Lin, I think you might be a bit biased sometimes. I am a nurse, but that doesn't mean that I don't understand other professions. A degree doesn't say everything about a person. Instead, there are many who don't even have a degree yet still have contributed a lot to society.\" </p><p>\"You're being hypothetical, there's no point in bringing that up. How about this, tell me what you understand about forensics. Let's sit down and talk. Not about anything else, just about the profession. Do you dare?\" </p><p>\"Ha, if that could alter your bias towards people with less prestigious academic backgrounds, then I'd be more than happy to.\" </p><p>\"Okay, sit down, but let me be frank beforehand. If you can't answer the questions I've raised, then you have to properly apologize to me for all the wildly arrogant words and actions you previously committed.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>\"On the other hand, if you answer all of my questions correctly, then I will apologize to you and re-adjust my bias towards those with less prestigious academic backgrounds, what do you think?\" asked Lin Mingyu. </p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian originally wanted to leave, but when she heard Lin Mingyu's words, she changed her mind. If she didn't teach this pretentious forensics guy a lesson, then she wouldn't be able to let go of this grudge. </p><p>\"Of course, it's not too late if you surrender now. I won't mock you for it either.\" </p><p>\"No thanks, I won't surrender before I try,\" Huo Mian calmly replied. </p><p>\"You really are something else.\" Lin Mingyu smiled.</p><p>\"So, Mr. Lin, the clock is ticking, let's talk about your profession,\" said Huo Mian sternly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":121,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:41.39","Link":"Chapter-121","NameDisplay":"Chapter 121"},{"ID":181120948418438200,"Name":"Chapter 122: Dumbfounded","NameUnsign":"Chapter 122: Dumbfounded","Description":"<p>Chapter 122: Dumbfounded</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Lin Mingyu smiled and laughed mockingly. Then, he rested his chin on both of his hands as he stared into Huo Mian's eyes and said, \"You know of the work forensic officers do, right? Foremost, we conduct chemical and biological tests on specific extracted materials. Second, we conduct clinical medicine tests, which utilizes clinical knowledge to inspect and detect the biology of a given matter and its pathology. This allows us to resolve the responsibilities in medical incidents, to prevent the spread of viruses in biohazard situations, so on and so forth. There are three main categories of investigation methods during this process, based on chemistry, biology, and physics. Which techniques does each of these categories include? Of course, you don't have to name all of them. I'll let you pass even if you only mention a few notable ones.\" </p><p>Lin Mingyu thought that as soon as he asked this question, Huo Mian would not know what to say, because it was too specific for an average nurse.</p><p>However, after Huo Mian listened carefully, she looked at him and replied, \"The chemical investigation techniques includes deploying chemical analytic approaches for the regulated testing of poison, which would include the testing of poison inside vomit or excretions. Chemical methods can detect whether there is blood and, along with biological methods, one could use mutations and polymorphisms in DNA, human composition, and DNA sequencing technology to identify the victim.\"</p><p>At this point, Lin Mingyu was slightly shocked, as he would never have expected that this little nurse would know so much. </p><p>Then, Huo Mian continued, \"The biological investigation methods are quite interesting. They use immunoserology to categorize blood and semen stains, as well as other liquids, bones, fur, hair, or other bodily excretions of individuals or animals. It utilizes micro-biological studies, theories, and techniques to study bacteria and pathology, which includes a detailed investigation of the age, gender, and ethnicity of the corpse.\" </p><p>\"Not bad,\" Lin Mingyu nodded and intentionally acted very calmly to suppress his shock deep down. </p><p>Huo Mian looked at him, \"As for the last category. Physics research is also the method that I'm most interested in. It utilizes instruments to test the firmness and density of skin and bones. It conducts a test that mimics the act of damaging, which employs X-Ray technology, and, through this, it predicts the age of the bones and identifies foreign matter inside the body. It uses gas chromatography, ultraviolet light, infrared photometry, mass-spectrometry, magnetic resonance technology, nMRI, and so forth to analyze the amount of poison and drugs within collected materials. It uses light spectrum analyzes, electrophoresis assays, and microscopy to conduct physical evidence testing in forensics. That's it, I've finished.\"</p><p>\"You're… completely correct.\" The way Lin Mingyu looked at Huo Mian had now completely changed. </p><p>He was no longer prideful like before. Instead, he was somewhat shocked, or even dumbfounded. </p><p>\"The… medical school you studied at taught nurses these concepts?\" asked Lin Mingyu without much conviction. </p><p>\"Of course not. I learned these myself outside of school. I'm very interested in medicine. Aside from forensics, I'm also familiar with neurosurgery and ophthalmology. I've read many books regarding these subjects and think human anatomy is truly a very interesting subject. Of course, if one is able to understand human anatomy, one could cure all kinds of diseases to prolong life. That, I think, is the most glorious discovery of human beings to this day.\"</p><p>\"You… have truly shocked me.\" Lin Mingyu no longer hid his admiration for Huo Mian.</p><p>Lin Mingyu had always been proud of his talents, and because of that, he's been very pretentious on every date he had gone to. Now that a little intern nurse had defeated him, he couldn't help but realize how anything could be possible. </p><p>\"It's nothing, just sparked by own interest.\" Huo Mian smiled faintly. </p><p>\"It's truly a pity that you're only a nurse. I need an assistant at the public security bureau. If you're interested, you could fill out a form and take a test in three months. If you pass, you would successfully become an employee there. My cousin said you were a genius when she spoke of you before, but I didn't think too much of it back then. I even thought that she was exaggerating, but now it seems that you're truly quite something. I have faith in you.\" </p><p>In all seriousness, Lin Mingyu suddenly turned this date into a job interview. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't know if she should laugh or cry. </p><p>\"It's not necessary, uhm… I like my job, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse.\" </p><p>Lin Mingyu didn't expect Huo Mian to reject his invitation right away. He was offering her a rare opportunity after all.</p><p>\"Since you're not interested in being my assistant, then be my girlfriend. After all these dates, I finally met someone who is my type. That's right, Huo Mian, it's you. I've got my eyes set on you,\" Lin Mingyu pointed at Huo Mian and solemnly announced.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":122,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:41.843","Link":"Chapter-122","NameDisplay":"Chapter 122"},{"ID":181120948423216738,"Name":"Chapter 123: The Night Shift","NameUnsign":"Chapter 123: The Night Shift","Description":"<p>Chapter 123: The Night Shift</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Eh… Mr. Liu, that… I'm terribly sorry, I can't accept your offer.\" Huo Mian had only wanted to teach a lesson to Lin Mingyu, this pretentious guy who looked down on those with lesser education. </p><p>She never thought that he would end up falling for her and ask her to be his girlfriend. </p><p>\"Why not? We're very compatible, are we not? With your knowledge in forensics, we would have a lot to talk about, and after we get married, I can even send you to study in the United States. Once you become a doctor, with your talent, you'd have no problem in becoming an ophthalmologist or neurosurgeon. It's totally possible! You're still so young so you should have dreams like these, no?\" </p><p>\"You're mistaken, my dream is just to be a nurse. Ha, right now I am very happy with where I'm at. I don't want to study abroad, nor do I want to become a doctor.\" </p><p>\"Why not?\" Lin Mingyu asked for the second time. </p><p>\"Everyone walks a different path, and no one has the right to decide someone else's path. I'm very thankful that you think so highly of me, but those things are not what I want. As for being your girlfriend, I must apologize, but I've come today to explain that I'm already taken; I have a boyfriend. The head nurse didn't give me the chance to explain my situation to her and ended up with the misunderstanding. I am sorry for all the inconvenience that I caused, but I don't want to lie to anyone, so I am telling you everything.\" </p><p>\"You have a boyfriend already?\" Lin Mingyu was slightly disappointed. </p><p>\"Yes, the head nurse thought that I was still upset over my previous breakup, so she introduced us to each other out of the goodness of her heart, but I already have a boyfriend. He's my high school classmate, someone I've known for many years, and we have an excellent relationship.\" </p><p>\"Nothing is set in stone before marriage, so don't make any conclusions so quickly.\" Lin Mingyu was unwilling to give up yet. </p><p>Huo Mian smiled with her lips pressed into a line… </p><p>\"I was a bit too forward with my words just now, even showing off in front of you, a forensics expert, of what little knowledge I know. I want to apologize, and please don't take my words too seriously.\" </p><p>\"No, I'm the one that must apologize. Your words today shocked me and altered the way I see things. I'll never use a person's educational background to judge them in the future.\" Lin Mingyu felt great respect towards Huo Mian. </p><p>\"If that's true, then that's great. I hope that things will go well for your job and life in the future.\" Huo Mian got up to leave. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, can we be friends?\" Lin Mingyu suddenly asked from behind. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't say anything or even turn around. She only raised her right index and middle fingers to make a peace sign. </p><p>Lin Mingyu smiled… This was the most special blind date he had been on in all these years. </p><p>After returning to the hospital, the head nurse immediately dragged Huo Mian into her office and quietly asked, \"What do you think? How was my cousin?\" </p><p>\"Great.\" </p><p>\"So are you guys together now?\" the head nurse asked anxiously. </p><p>\"Um… No, sorry, Head Nurse, we're not suitable for each other.\" </p><p>The head nurse was mildly disappointed, \"No worries, if there are any other good ones in the future, I'll introduce you.\" </p><p>\"No, it's fine. I already have a boyfriend, Head Nurse.\" </p><p>\"Already? Who is it?\" </p><p>\"Um… my high school classmate.\" </p><p>\"You kids, really. Why do you all like to look back and date your high school and middle school classmates, is there a point?\" the head nurse lamented. </p><p>Huo Mian just smiled… </p><p>That night, while eating dinner at the hospital cafeteria, Huo Mian and Huang Yue were in the middle of a conversation when a female doctor talking nearby caught Huo Mian's attention. </p><p>She said, \"GK's new President is crazy. He announced today that for the following week, everyone will take the days off and work at night! What a weirdo! Now my boyfriend has to work night shifts all week. I finally didn't have to work night shifts this week, but I can't believe our schedules switched.\"</p><p>\"Huh? What a weirdo. This is the first time I've heard of a company that works at night. Does the president think his employees are plants, why do they have to work only at night? That sounds like torture.\"</p><p>Hearing all this, Huo Mian felt unsettled. Qin Chu's orders... they didn't have anything to do with her, right?</p><p>With that thought, she took out her phone and sent a WeChat message to Qin Chu.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":123,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:42.323","Link":"Chapter-123","NameDisplay":"Chapter 123"},{"ID":18112094842801501,"Name":"Chapter 124: I Do What I Want","NameUnsign":"Chapter 124: I Do What I Want","Description":"<p>Chapter 124: I Do What I Want</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Are you there?\" </p><p>\"I'm here,\" Qin Chu replied within seconds. </p><p>\"I heard… your company's employees are all pulling night shifts for the next week.\" </p><p>\"Yeah.\" </p><p>\"Why?\" </p><p>\"Because night shifts are good.\" Qin Chu's reply was undeniably suspicious. </p><p>What kind of answer was that? Huo Mian was certain that GK's sudden night shifts definitely had something to do with her. </p><p>This wasn't because she was narcissistic, it was just too much of a coincidence that whenever she had a night shift, so did everyone at GK. </p><p>\"I get off work at 8 AM tomorrow morning.\" </p><p>\"What a coincidence, I get off work tomorrow morning at eight as well,\" Qin Chu replied. </p><p>Huo Mian was so angry that she wasn't sure whether she should laugh or cry... </p><p>Coincidence, what coincidence was this? He was clearly following her work schedule, okay? </p><p>\"Are you coming home after work tomorrow morning?\" </p><p>\"Yeah.\" </p><p>\"Then let's talk then, I have some things to tell you.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>After sending the Wechat message, Huo Mian sighed… and she lost her appetite. </p><p>If her need to work night shifts led to the misery of the entire GK corporation, then wouldn't she be considered a big sinner? </p><p>Buddhist sutras would definitely consider this as a sin… When she dies, would she have to go to hell? </p><p>At that thought, Huo Mian felt cold, and shuddered… </p><p>\"Mian, why aren't you eating?\" </p><p>\"I'm full.\" </p><p>\"You ate so little, you have no appetite, and you look so pale... are you pregnant? When we return to the clinic, we should get you an ultrasound,\" Huang Yue said cheekily. </p><p>\"An ultrasound my ass. What pregnancy, maybe I was just lusting about romance.\" Huo Mian tapped her chopsticks on her friend's head. </p><p>After spending so much time with Huang Yue, Huo Mian realized that she was a silly, sweet girl… </p><p>Huang Yue was still young, her heart was pure, and she hadn't yet been corrupted by society. </p><p>Other than working at the hospital, she spent the majority of her days submerged in romantic Korean dramas. Truth be told, Huo Mian was quite envious of Huang Yue a lot of the times. </p><p>At least her life was simple. She was careless, like a child...</p><p>After working through the night, she was finally able to go home. Huo Mian had to take care of an expecting mother all night. </p><p>The pregnant woman had already reached her due date, and the baby was to arrive any day now. </p><p>Word was that she had married into a wealthy family, and her mother-in-law and husband demanded that she give birth naturally, claiming that a C-section was bad for the baby. </p><p>But after looking at the data, Huo Mian discovered that it was highly unlikely for this expecting mother to give birth naturally. </p><p>First off, the baby's umbilical cord was wrapped twice around its neck, which was extremely dangerous and may cause the baby to suffocate at birth. </p><p>The other reason was that the pregnant woman had extremely high blood pressure, and her urology report came back with two extra positives. </p><p>This was a sign of gestational hypertension, and during the ultrasound, the gynecologist had said that the infant was estimated to be between 4.5 to 5.1 kg. </p><p>With such a heavy weight, it would be incredibly difficult and dangerous if she were to give birth naturally. </p><p>The pregnant woman had a thin frame; although she was close to her due date, she weighed less than 60 kg. </p><p>What made Huo Mian most anxious was that the woman was only 2 centimeters dilated and was in constant pain, yet the baby just wouldn't come out. </p><p>The pregnant woman's mother kept crying, trying to convince her to have a C-section, since it was safer. </p><p>But the pregnant woman insisted on a natural birth because her mother-in-law and husband would not be pleased if she didn't. </p><p>After toughing it out for a night, the pregnant woman was still unable to give birth in the morning.

Instead, he turned the audio system on. </p><p>A melodious tune filled the car, which Huo Mian identified to be a song from their younger years… </p><p>\"Because I dreamt of you leaving, I woke up in tears. </p><p>Watching the night wind blow past the window, can you feel my love? </p><p>When we get old, will you still be by my side? </p><p>Watch as those lies and oaths, dissipate with our past. </p><p>So many people once envied your looks during youth, but no one wants to bear the heartless changes of aging. </p><p>How many people have passed by you in life, but knowing that I have you, I've always stayed by your side.\"</p><p>Huo Mian had originally planned on taking a nap, but upon hearing this song, she immediately felt awake. </p><p>Although she was born in the 1990s, she didn't know many celebrities and only enjoyed listening to a few old songs, especially ones that reminded her of high school. </p><p>She used to have a USB that contained all her favorite songs. </p><p>But when she moved out in a hurry, Qin Chu didn't let her bring anything, and thus she lost it, which she still regretted to this day. </p><p>In that USB, the first song was this melancholic \"A life with You\". </p><p>It was a pleasant surprise for her to hear this song in Qin Chu's car. </p><p>But upon hearing that the next song was \"When love approaches\" by Rene Liu, her calmness disappeared. </p><p>Opening her eyes, she asked, \"Your playlist is the same as the one I had before, what a coincidence.\" </p><p>\"I found this USB in the old apartment you used to live in.\" </p><p>\"Oh….\" Huo Mian was shocked after hearing what Qin Chu said. </p><p>\"So, you took my USB? You didn't even tell me? Do you know how rude that is?\" Huo Mian was choked with anger. </p><p>\"I'm just using something that belongs to me, how is that rude?\" Qin Chu replied. </p><p>\"Oh please, this is mine, okay?\" Huo Mian shot back. </p><p>\"We're husband and wife, we share everything. What's yours is mine,\" Qin Chu announced domineeringly. </p><p>Huo Mian felt a little suffocated and retorted, \"In that case, half of the GK corporation is also mine, so I'm a billionaire! Even if I just sit at home and do nothing all day.\" </p><p>\"That's right,\" Qin Chu replied faintly since he never really cared about financial assets anyways. </p><p>That's why he hadn't even bothered to get a prenup, especially with Huo Mian. He was willing to give her anything. </p><p>Seeing Qin Chu reply so calmly, Huo Mian lost her will to bicker with him and sighed… </p><p>\"Qin Chu, don't make your employees take any more night shifts, that's not normal for white-collars, it's ridiculous.\" </p><p>\"Is this what you wanted to talk about?\" Qin Chu raised an eyebrow, clearly upset. </p><p>\"Yeah, I unintentionally heard what you did while I was eating in the cafeteria. GK has so many employees, do you know how many people are affected by this decision? I don't want that! You're not a kid, you can't be so immature, so hurry up and change it back.\" </p><p>\"Fine.\" </p><p>Qin Chu replied so quickly that he made Huo Mian suspicious of how easy this talk went.</p><p>Then he added, \"But you have to kiss me.\" </p><p>\"Oh please, those are your employees. What do they have to do with me?\" Huo Mian was speechless. </p><p>\"Yeah, those people at GK are my employees, but I'm your husband. If you make me happy, then I'll change their schedules back.\" </p><p>Seeing Qin Chu acting like a scoundrel, even Huo Mian ran out of ideas and speedily planted a half-hearted kiss on his cheek. </p><p>\"There, now make the call.\"</p><p>\"I didn't ask you to kiss my cheek, who gave you the right to do that?\" Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian in a baffled manner. </p><p>\"Qin… Chu, you jerk,\" Huo Mian hissed through her teeth.</p><p>\"Kiss me again, this time on the lips,\" Qin Chu commanded domineeringly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":125,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:43.233","Link":"Chapter-125","NameDisplay":"Chapter 125"},{"ID":181120948437257262,"Name":"Chapter 126: Enemy","NameUnsign":"Chapter 126: Enemy","Description":"<p>Chapter 126: Enemy</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Qin Chu, don't go too far,\" frowning, Huo Mian warned him.</p><p>\"What? Are you embarrassed? It's fine, I'm not.\" He did not wait for Huo Mian to reply after speaking and suddenly stepped on the brakes. He parked the car by the side of the street and smoothly pushed Huo Mian down.</p><p>Qin Chu was very dominant with the kiss, stripping Huo Mian breathless.</p><p>After a while, someone knocked on the car window...</p><p>Qin Chu impatiently rolled down the window to see a traffic policeman standing beside the car with a ticket in his hand.</p><p>\"You can't park here, the violation fine is two hundred yuan.\"</p><p>However, Qin Chu took out a few hundred yuan bills and said, \"Here you go, you can keep driving.\"</p><p>The traffic policeman held the money, not knowing what to do...</p><p>Were all rich people capricious like that?

It was unknown as to what kind of messes were contained within the guy's brain. Sometimes, his replies were enough to really piss people off.</p><p>The seafood restaurant was very famous in C city and had a high-class environment.</p><p>One meal would cost at least tens of thousands of yuan, so there were only a few patrons, mostly rich people.</p><p>Huo Mian never imagined that she would encounter Huo Siqian at this place. The saying, 'enemies are bound to meet' was really true.</p><p>\"Hi, little sister.\" He always initiated their meetings with a smile.</p><p>Huo Siqian embraced a hot curvy girl who was clearly not the person he was with at the hospital last time.</p><p>One thing Huo Mian knew about Huo Siqian's private life was that he was promiscuous. He frequently switched partners and often appeared on the headlines of entertainment newspapers.</p><p>The paparazzi had already dug up everything about the Four Princes of C City...</p><p>Huo Siqian also didn't think that he would encounter Huo Mian here. Most importantly, the person beside Huo Mian… was that Qin Chu?</p><p>\"I would never have thought that I would see you two together again.\" Huo Siqian laughed.</p><p>Qin Chu did not even raise his head, only coldly replying, \"You should be honored to be able to see something like this in your life.\"</p><p>\"How surprising, does this count as reigniting old love?\" Huo Siqian's smile was complicated.</p><p>Huo Mian raised her head too and impolitely said, \"How is that any of your business?\"</p><p>\"As your brother, naturally I care about my sister's life. I've been preparing for father's birthday feast. Will you be there?\"</p><p>\"What joke is that? What does his birthday have to do with me?\"</p><p>\"Father will be disappointed to know how heartless you are.\"</p><p>\"He won't be. Huo Yanyan is enough for him.

You're so charming when you're angry.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was furious and wanted to talk back, but Qin Chu placed his hand around her waist and said, \"Mian, let's go.\"</p><p>After walking out of the restaurant, Huo Mian was still angry...</p><p>\"Why did you pull me away, I should've taught him a lesson.\"</p><p>\"Listen to me, avoid him from now on. Don't go near that person; he's very complicated.\"</p><p>To Qin Chu, Huo Siqian was a dangerous person, and that was why he forbade Huo Mian from approaching him.</p><p>Truthfully, Huo Mian had always avoided him. But, for some reason, he was always floating around her...</p><p>It was the same seven years ago as it was seven years later...</p><p>\"Mr. Huo, who was that woman?\"</p><p>\"She's my sister.\" Huo Siqian chuckled.</p><p>\"Isn't Yanyan... your only sister?\" the woman seemed surprised and asked Huo Siqian.</p><p>\"Yeah, but this is also my sister, my… dearest sister.\" The corners of Huo Siqian's mouth rose up into a smile.</p><p>Due to Huo Siqian's interruption, their seafood dinner disappointingly went to waste.</p><p>\"We paid for the food but we didn't get to eat it. How unfortunate.\" In the car, Huo Mian pouted.</p><p>\"I asked them to pack it up and deliver it to our home.\"</p><p>When Huo Mian heard that, she gave him a thumbs up and said, \"Good job.\"</p><p>\"Thanks to food, you complimented me for the first time. Should I be happy or unhappy?\" Qin Chu looked at her with an odd expression on his face.</p><p>Huo Mian dryly coughed and remained silent...</p><p>Soon after they drove back to Imperial Park, the restaurant delivered the food.</p><p>In the delivery was everything they ordered.</p><p>Then, the two began joyfully eating again.</p><p>In between the meal, Qin Chu inadvertently asked, \"Huo Zhenghai wants you to return to the Huo Family?\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded, \"Last time when grandma passed away, he asked me but I refused. Think about it, he never paid attention to me over the past years, and now that I am older, he comes back looking for me. Don't you think that's ridiculous?\"</p><p>\"He probably has hidden intentions behind his kindness,\" Qin Chu analyzed.</p><p>\"Of course, I suspect that it's about his inheritance. Huo Siqian wields the majority of the power in the Huo Corporation. Although he's only the vice president, it's been said that Huo Zhenghai had been overtaken and he cannot control his son. All these years, Jiang Hong and her adopted son quietly seeped through the internal departments of the corporation, buying people out and bribing members of the board. The expulsion of Huo Zhenghai's favorite mistress, Shen Jiani, and her two children is bound to happen sooner or later. Huo Zhenghai may have seen this coming, so he decided to utilize my return to officially transfer shares to me, which will eventually go to Shen Jiani to make sure that they won't be kicked off the board.\"</p><p>\"I thought that you weren't concerned with this, I didn't expect your research to be so thorough.\" Qin Chu always knew that Huo Mian had an astonishingly high IQ, so he was never surprised when she revealed her smarts.</p><p>\"I didn't have to do any research. It's really easy to deduce since I see it on the financial news all the time. The asset dispute of the Huo Family is imminent. Even blood brothers will fall out, not to mention brothers from different mothers. Huo Siqian is an adopted son, so if he inherits the Huo Corporation, naturally, Huo Zhenghai will be displeased. Though Huo Siyi is his birth son, he's too useless. As for me, I think these things are just karma. There's no way I will let him use me to save his mistress. I am not that kind of a person.\"</p><p>Qin Chu nodded, agreeing with what Huo Mian said.</p><p>\"Indeed, the Huo Corporation's money isn't that incentivizing. But if it pleases you, I can forcefully purchase the Huo Corporation anytime,\" Qin Chu casually said.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"No, I have no interest in the Huo Corporation.\"</p><p>The two conversed while eating, and Huo Mian cleaned up afterward. However, as she was about to head upstairs, she noticed that Qin Chu's face was pale and weak-looking.</p><p>\"What happened? You look terrible,\" worried, she asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":127,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:44.257","Link":"Chapter-127","NameDisplay":"Chapter 127"},{"ID":181120948447573467,"Name":"Chapter 128: Habit","NameUnsign":"Chapter 128: Habit","Description":"<p>Chapter 128: Habit</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I'm fine.\" Qin Chu's face was as pale as a ghost despite his consistent denial.</p><p>As a health care provider, Huo Mian could immediately tell he wasn't feeling well.  </p><p>\"Come on, Qin Chu, tell me what's wrong.\" Huo Mian appeared to be extremely anxious. What in the world happened? He was fine just a moment ago.  </p><p>\"It hurts a little here,\" Qin Chu slowly said as he pointed at his abdomen.</p><p>Huo Mian looked at where he was pointing to. \"It can't be appendicitis, it's not in the right spot. C'mon, we can't delay this, let's go to the hospital now.\"</p><p>\"It's fine, not a big deal.\" </p><p>\"No, you have to listen to me.\" Huo Mian was furious. As a medical doctor from one of the best universities in the world, how could he even attempt to tough it out when he's not feeling well? It was simply unjustifiable. </p><p>\"It's just enteritidis, it's not a big deal.\" Qin Chu finally told her the truth. </p><p>Huo Mian was caught by surprise. \"Enteritidis? Why would you have enteritidis? Oh, we just ate seafood. Oh my god! You can't eat seafood!\"</p><p>Huo Mian's eyes grew wide as she stared at Qin Chu in disbelief. </p><p>Qin Chu held his tongue, seemingly in acquiescence. </p><p>But seven years ago, Huo Mian remembered clearly that Qin Chu would eat seafood with her because she loved seafood. </p><p>Why didn't she ever notice anything? Had he been hiding it this whole time? </p><p>\"If you can't eat seafood, why didn't you just say so?\" Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu and demanded. </p><p>\"Because you like it,\" Qin Chu answered slowly. </p><p>Huo Mian became even more furious after hearing his answer. What kind of bullshit answer was that? Just because she liked seafood, it didn't mean he needed to disregard his health and eat seafood with her. </p><p>\"I also like to eat arsenic, would you like some?\" Huo Mian said angrily. </p><p>\"That works too.\" </p><p>\"Works my ass, Qin Chu, you idiot! Get up, we are going to the hospital.\" Without another word, Huo Mian grabbed Qin Chu's arm. This was the first time since they reunited after seven years that Huo Mian swore.</p><p>Not only did Qin Chu not get mad, he smiled...</p><p>Because finally, the Huo Mian in front of him was the real Huo Mian from seven years ago. </p><p>\"Hospital, go! Hurry up!\" Huo Mian was running out of patience. </p><p>Qin Chu looked at her glowing red face amusingly and smiled, \"I'm a doctor, and you're a nurse. We've got two healthcare providers in the family, why do we still need to go to the hospital? I'll just take some pills.\" </p><p>\"No, don't try to fool me. Acute enteritidis can be very serious. If it's not treated in time, you will become dehydrated. You'll need an IV..\" </p><p>\"There's some medicine at home. Mian, you should administer my IV.\" </p><p>Qin Chu stared at Huo Mian, his eyes filled with endless waves of tenderness. </p><p>\"There's medicine at home? Where?\" Huo Mian let go of Qin Chu's arm and got up. </p><p>\"There's an emergency kit underneath the living room cabinet. The infusion tube is in there as well.\" Huo Mian immediately took the emergency kit out. She gave the kit a glance and noticed that it was well equipped. It had all sorts of over-the-counter drugs as well as infusion tubes. </p><p>\"Why do you have all this? I've never seen anyone put infusion tubes in their first aid kit.\" Huo Mian didn't know what to say. </p><p>\"Because I was prepared to eat more seafood with you,\" Qin Chu said nonchalantly. </p><p>Huo Mian's heart ached when she heard what Qin Chu said. Just because she liked to eat seafood, this idiot decided to have medicine and infusion tubes ready so he could stealthily treat his enteritidis after eating with her? He was risking his life for her. </p><p>Huo Mian's face was grim as she administered the IV for Qin Chu.</p><p>Her heart felt heavy. </p><p>It was an ineffable feeling. </p><p>Afterward, Huo Mian checked the flow of the IV bag. Once she ensured everything was normal, she propped a back cushion behind Qin Chu. </p><p>Qin Chu felt a little overwhelmed by the unexpected care as he watched her take care of him. </p><p>Much like a kid, his eyes were full of happiness, and he was certainly pleasantly surprised. </p><p>\"Let me ask you something, Qin Chu, why didn't you tell me earlier that you can't eat seafood?\" Huo Mian looked into Qin Chu's eyes and interrogated him like a criminal. </p><p>\"I've gotten used to it since we started dating.\" </p><p>\"Gotten used to what? You've gotten used to giving yourself IVs and feeling tortured after eating seafood?\" </p><p>Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>\"You dumb idiot.\" Huo Mian reached out and pinched Qin Chu's devilishly gorgeous face. </p><p>\"I'm an idiot, you're a genius.

You can tell me what you want to eat and I will prepare it,\" Huo Mian said slowly after a while. </p><p>\"I can eat whatever I want?\" Qin Chu tilted his head and stared at Huo Mian, his eyes gleaming. </p><p>Huo Mian immediately knew that this guy was probably thinking about something inappropriate. </p><p>Sure enough, the next sentence Qin Chu said was, \"Can I eat you?\" </p><p>\"No,\" Huo Mian immediately and strictly refused. </p><p>Qin Chu looked down at the needle in his arm and didn't say anything. He looked slightly disappointed. </p><p>\"I can make some vegetable congee for you later. You have enteritidis, so you can't eat anything greasy.\" </p><p>\"So, you're saying I can't eat you because you're too greasy?\" Qin Chu playfully lifted his head and asked. </p><p>Immediately, Huo Mian raged with fire. </p><p>\"Do you want to die? I'm not greasy.\" </p><p>\"Right, you're fat but not greasy, it's a good thing!\" </p><p>Huo Mian was exasperated. If this guy weren't a patient, she would have surely tossed him out the window, despite them living on the sixteenth floor.

Why weren't you at work?\" </p><p>\"I was out on business,\" Qin Chu said nonchalantly. </p><p>\"You look pale, are you feeling alright?\" A mother could always notice the tiniest of details.</p><p>\"Yeah, I've been pretty busy.\" </p><p>\"I told you not to work so hard. You can delegate miscellaneous tasks to the people below you. You're making me worry.\" </p><p>\"Mom, did you need me for something?\" </p><p>\"What would I need you for? I just miss you, that's all, so I thought I would come and see you.\" </p><p>Qin Chu nodded and said nothing. He turned to open the documents on his desk and began reading. </p><p>\"Son, the Tiantong Group's President is turning sixty soon, you…\" </p><p>\"I don't have time. You and dad can go to those business gatherings,\" Qin Chu interjected before his mother could finish. </p><p>Mrs. Qin sighed, \"Son, you're getting older now, you can't just focus on work. You should find a girlfriend. You don't need to get married, just so long as you start dating first. Your dad and I are getting old, and we want grandchildren soon.\" </p><p>\"I will keep that in mind.\" Qin Chu answered, clearly saying it just to satisfy Mrs. Qin. </p><p>\"There's been some rumors going around. Look at our family status, we can't let those clowns talk about us like that.\" </p><p>\"What are they saying about me?\" Qin Chu put down the report and lifted his head in curiosity. </p><p>\"They are saying… um… anyways, whatever they're saying is terrible. Just hurry up and find a girlfriend so I can stop worrying. The girl doesn't need to be like us, it's fine even if she's someone with an ordinary family background. I don't have a lot of demands for you anymore, as long as she's a woman.\" </p><p>The rumors were that GK's president could possibly be homosexual, and Mrs. Qin had been worried sick. </p><p>\"So it could be anyone?\" Qin Chu asked. </p><p>\"Yes, as long as she's a girl, and of course, as long as she's not Huo Mian.\" </p><p>\"I will take care of my own business.\" Qin Chu looked away as his eyes dimmed.</p><p>\"If you're not busy, let's have dinner together.\" </p><p>\"Mom, I'm busy. Maybe another day.\" </p><p>Qin Chu felt slightly uncomfortable by the fact that after all these years, Mrs. Qin still wouldn't accept Huo Mian. </p><p>So, he didn't even provide his mother with the opportunity to have a meal with him. Seeing her son so busy with work, Mrs. Qin didn't dare say anything else and stood up to leave. </p><p>As she was walking out, she bumped into Jiang Lingyue, who came to the top floor to deliver some reports. </p><p>Due to previous warnings, Jiang Lingyue never had the guts to walk into the president's office again. She would directly pass the files either to the assistant's office or Assistant Yang. </p><p>\"Mrs. Qin, I didn't know you were here.\" Jiang Lingyue smiled gracefully. </p><p>\"Yes.\" Prior to Qin Chu's return, Mrs. Qin used to be the CFO of GK, so Jiang Lingyue knew who she was. </p><p>\"If you're not busy, Mrs. Qin, you should come to have tea in my office. I never get to see you, I've missed you dearly since your departure.\" </p><p>\"Let's go.\" Mrs. Qin liked sweet talkers like Jiang Lingyue. </p><p>Mrs. Qin knew that Jiang Lingyue studied overseas and that she was smart, talented, and great at establishing social relations. Naturally, Mrs. Qin couldn't help but have a favorable impression towards her. </p><p>Qin Chu was working on reports when Huo Mian's call came in. </p><p>\"Mian.\" </p><p>\"Did you finish your infusion?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"Where are you?\" </p><p>\"Home.\" </p><p>\"Yeah? Accept my video request then.\" Huo Mian quickly hung up and called Qin Chu again through video chat. </p><p>With no other choice, Qin Chu had to hit the decline button and proceeded to send a voice message, \"The Wi-Fi at home is down, I can't connect. I don't have enough data on my phone either.\" </p><p>Huo Mian almost passed out with rage.  </p><p>It's understandable to say that the Wi-Fi was down, but not enough data? Was he expecting her to fall for that lie? </p><p>Does this guy look like someone who was afraid to use too much data?</p><p>\"Qin Chu, are you trying to challenge my intelligence?\" Huo Mian sent him a voice message.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":130,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:45.927","Link":"Chapter-130","NameDisplay":"Chapter 130"},{"ID":181120948463966467,"Name":"Chapter 131: Saving Life","NameUnsign":"Chapter 131: Saving Life","Description":"<p>Chapter 131: Saving Life</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"No, I wouldn't dare.\" Qin Chu never thought about challenging Huo Mian's IQ, which was an incredible 130. </p><p>\"So why won't you accept my video call?\" Huo Mian asked angrily. </p><p>\"I'm not at home, Mian, I'm at work. My mom came to GK and wanted to see me. You didn't want them to know about us, so I couldn't let her come to our new home,\" Qin Chu explained patiently. </p><p>\"Oh.\" Huo Mian replied with one word and disappeared. </p><p>Obviously, she wasn't fond of Qin Chu's mother. After all, Mrs. Qin was the main reason behind Uncle Jing's death. </p><p>Huo Mian put the phone in her pocket. Since Qin Chu was fine now, there was no point in her worrying. </p><p>Why was she so worried? She thought she didn't love him anymore. </p><p>She must be feeling bad because the enteritidis was caused by eating seafood with her. Yes, that must be it! </p><p>Huo Mian thought to herself deludedly... </p><p>Later that evening, when eating at the hospital cafeteria, she heard others mention that He Man had resigned. </p><p>According to the rumors, Wu Xiaoxue couldn't stand to have her in the ophthalmology department, let alone having her work closely with Ning Zhiyuan, day in and day out. </p><p>So, she found an excuse to transfer her to the morgue. He Man understood the difficulties that lied ahead and decided to step back. Therefore, she resigned. </p><p>Apparently, she made sure to make a scene prior to leaving the Ophthalmology Department and left Ning Zhiyuan very embarrassed. </p><p>He Man, the woman who wanted to watch the world plunge into chaos, wanted to get rid of Huo Mian, but got rid of herself instead. It seemed like she accidentally shot herself in the foot. </p><p>\"Mian, He Man is gone now. We will have nothing but peace and quiet from now on.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, less trouble for me.\" </p><p>\"I heard that He Man was pregnant. Initially, she wanted to use her pregnancy to threaten Ning Zhiyuan into marrying her, but then Dr. Wu became pregnant too. The decision was obvious for Ning Zhiyuan, so he somehow tricked He Man into taking abortion pills. She suffered quite a bit. It wasn't a very successful abortion either. She had to go to a private gynecology clinic not far from us for curettage because she was too scared to come to our clinic for help. If I were her, after going through all that just to get dumped in the end, I would be pissed off and make a scene too.\"</p><p>Huo Mian listened thoughtfully and couldn't help but feel bad for He Man... </p><p>It was never easy to be a woman, but why did women have to make each other miserable? The end result for He Man today was almost unbearable to look at. </p><p>\"You and Ning Zhiyuan were together for a long time, and he's been so nice to you. I never knew that he could be such an asshole. Perhaps he was just playing with He Man; I feel bad for her,\" Huang Yue sighed. </p><p>Huo Mian replied with silence. After all, this was none of her business anymore.</p><p>\"Mian, you should be more careful. I'm afraid that you might be Dr. Wu's next target,\" Huang Yue whispered. </p><p>\"It's fine. Worse comes to worst, I can quit. There are so many hospitals out there, I can just transfer to another one.\" </p><p>\"But I heard Wu Xiaoxue is quite resourceful. She made sure that none of the other hospitals would hire He Man.\" </p><p>\"He Man is He Man, I am me. I'm not afraid of her,\" she said, setting down her chopsticks since she had lost her appetite. </p><p>After dinner, Huo Mian and Huang Yue went back to the clinic and began their rounds.</p><p>They worked till eleven o'clock at night before things began settling down. </p><p>\"Big Sis Mian, I'm going to go take a little nap, can you take watch for me?\" </p><p>\"Sure, go sleep. I'll be here.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>The hallway suddenly became noisy... </p><p>Huo Mian opened the door and was frightened by what she saw... </p><p>A man was screaming as he held onto a pregnant woman, \"Where are the doctors? Please, somebody come and save my wife!\" </p><p>The pregnant woman was unconscious, and the lower half of her body was covered in blood, drenching her dark blue maternity dress. </p><p>\"Yue, wake up! Go find the doctor on call, we need to help this patient!\" </p><p>Huang Yue woke up from her nap stunned.</p><p>\"Mian, the on-call doctor left early, she said she had family issues. There are no doctors that can perform a C-Section right now. Can we help her through natural labor?\" </p><p>Huo Mian shook her head immediately, \"No, we can't, she's bleeding out. We'll need to stop the bleeding and give her a blood infusion. If we go through with natural labor under these circumstances, the mother and baby will both die. We need to go into surgery immediately.\"</p><p>\"Our surgeon already left work, perhaps you can go to another hospital?\" Huang Yue glanced at the patient and said to her husband. </p><p>\"No, we're running out of time. My wife's going to die from exhaustion. Please, save her!\" The man's knees hit the floor as he held onto his bleeding wife, tears streaming down his face. </p><p>Huo Mian furrowed her brows and struggled for a bit. \"Yue, take her into the OR. I'll start prepping her.\" </p><p>\"Mian, what are you going to do?\" Huang Yue looked puzzled.</p><p>\"Perform surgery on her.\" Then, Huo Mian walked into the sanitization room and changed.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":131,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:46.397","Link":"Chapter-131","NameDisplay":"Chapter 131"},{"ID":18112094846934545,"Name":"Chapter 132: Consequences","NameUnsign":"Chapter 132: Consequences","Description":"<p>Chapter 132: Consequences</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huang Yue was dumbstruck...</p><p>\"Who's the on-call doctor tonight?\" Huo Mian walked out with a surgical mask on after she changed. </p><p>\"It was supposed to be Wu Xiaoxue.\"</p><p>\"Why did she leave halfway through her shift? Shouldn't she be working through the night?\" Huo Mian frowned slightly. </p><p>\"She's the hospital director's niece, could we really have stopped her? It looked like she had some business to tend to elsewhere, so she left,\" Huang Yue replied. </p><p>Huo Mian picked up the office phone and called Wu Xiaoxue after searching on the phone directory. </p><p>The phone rang for five seconds before someone finally picked up. </p><p>\"Hello….?\" It sounded like Wu Xiaoxue was asleep. </p><p>\"Dr. Wu, we need you back here for a surgery. A patient's life is in danger, she's bleeding…\" Before Huo Mian had the chance to finish, the person on the other end interrupted her. </p><p>\"Are you crazy? Do you know what time it is?\"</p><p>Before Huo Mian could respond, the phone went dead... </p><p>Huo Mian was unwilling to give up, so she called again. However, Wu Xiaoxue turned her phone off. </p><p>Initially, she thought that since Wu Xiaoxue lived close by, if she took a taxi she could still make it to the hospital on time to operate. </p><p>It wasn't because Huo Mian wasn't confident enough to proceed with the operation, it was just that despite her excellent medical skills, she was still a nurse. </p><p>She didn't have the required medical certifications. If she were to operate, not only was it extremely risky, it could also bring forth many troubles in the future. </p><p>Huo Mian put down the phone and glanced at Huang Yue, \"Yue, if I were to operate, can you be my scrub nurse? Are you okay with that?\" </p><p>\"Mian, are you kidding? You're a nurse, not a doctor. Are you really going to operate?\" </p><p>Huang Yue asked in disbelief... </p><p>\"There's no time to think about all that now, this patient is losing too much blood. She won't be able to hold on for much longer. If we do nothing, two lives will be lost.\" </p><p>\"I know, Mian. I want to save them too, but we're not doctors and the on-call doctor isn't here. We have no other options. I feel really bad too, and I can only be an assistant. I don't know anything about surgery.\"</p><p>\"It's okay if you don't understand. I know how to do it. I need you to calm down and be my assistant.\" </p><p>\"But… even so, the two of us won't be able to perform the surgery. The anesthesiologist isn't here.\" Huang Yue was on the verge of crying.</p><p>It's almost midnight, and there's no anesthesiologist. The best option is to transfer the patient to another hospital, Huang Yue thought. </p><p>\"I can administer anesthesia.\" </p><p>\"Um...\" Huang Yue no longer had any idea what to say.</p><p>\"We can't wait any longer, hurry up and start preparing the operating room.\" Huo Mian slid on her gloves and walked out. </p><p>\"Mian, is this a joke? These are people's lives we're talking about.\" </p><p>Regardless of what Huang Yue said, Huo Mian had already made up her mind. She was going to perform the surgery with or without her. </p><p>Huo Mian looked at the man that was still sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>\"Take her to the OR.\"</p><p>\"She can have the surgery? That's great!\" The man got up excitedly. He held onto the pregnant woman and followed Huo Mian towards the OR.</p><p>Huo Mian had been working in the OB/GYN department for over six months now. C-Sections were performed almost every other day, so she was very familiar with the procedure. Despite having never actually performed such a surgery, she was confident that she wouldn't fail. </p><p>The only issue was that she was not a licensed doctor, and it would be rather troublesome if the family members decided to come looking for her after the surgery. </p><p>But of course, under normal circumstances, no one would pursue the matter if the operation was successful and the patient did not suffer from any side effects. </p><p>After all, she was only doing it because it was an emergency. </p><p>Huang Yue still felt unsettled before the surgery, \"Bis Sis Mian, we can't do it. It's too risky. If the operation fails, you will be charged with medical negligence. Not only will you go to jail, but you will also need to pay a lot of money. Even if you succeeded, you will still be in big trouble if the family decides to pursue the fact that you're not a licensed doctor. The losses outweigh the gains. We're not Jesus, we don't need to sacrifice ourselves to save others.\" </p><p>\"Yue, I understand what you're saying, and I've contemplated the issues you mentioned. But I can't watch two lives perish in front of my eyes, especially when I can save them. Do you understand? My teenage dream was to become a doctor. It is very meaningful to be able to study the human body and provide individuals a second chance at life after studying and understanding the state of their illness.\"</p><p>Before Huang Yue could say anything else, Huo Mian took a long and thin needle and injected a carefully-calculated amount of anesthesia into the patient's spine.</p><p>Huang Yue trembled in fear as she watched, for she knew that an untrained anesthesiologist may very likely leave the patient paralyzed for the rest of their life.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":132,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:46.933","Link":"Chapter-132","NameDisplay":"Chapter 132"},{"ID":181120948474332672,"Name":"Chapter 133: The All-Mighty Hand","NameUnsign":"Chapter 133: The All-Mighty Hand","Description":"<p>Chapter 133: The All-Mighty Hand</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"What are you still waiting for? Insert the catheter. Hurry up, I will give her a blood transfusion.\" </p><p>\"Um, but do you know the patient's blood type?\" Huang Yue asked, not knowing what to do. Deep down, she felt vacant, because this operation was just too risky. Not a lot of places would even perform an operation like this, because they may as well kill themselves if something goes wrong. </p><p>\"I've already checked, she's AB-type blood. I already took out some blood bags from the blood bank,\" Huo Mian said calmly. </p><p>\"Mian, tell me something you don't know. How do you know everything?\" </p><p>Huang Yue was so overwhelmed that she wanted to cry. She had known Mian for a little over half a year now, but during a moment like this, the average-looking Mian turned into someone capable of anything, like Wonder Woman. </p><p>\"Don't be nervous. It's fine. Just do what you always do, and I will take care of the rest,\" seeing how anxious Huang Yue was, Huo Mian assured her. </p><p>After hearing what she said, Huang Yue put her foot down and bravely decided to assist this surgeon, who had no prior experience in this type of surgery.</p><p>Huang Yue followed Huo Mian's instructions and immediately inserted the patient's catheter, all while monitoring her vitals. </p><p>Huo Mian completed the blood transfusion, covered the patient's face with an oxygen mask and began the process of homeostasis, one action after the other. </p><p>Her lightning-quick speed left Huang Yue speechless... </p><p>The pregnant woman lied on the operating table completely naked, slowly losing consciousness. </p><p>Huo Mian made the decision to administer general anesthesia on the patient since there was no longer any meaning in using local anesthesia on an unconscious patient. Local anesthesia only worked if the patient was conscious.</p><p>However, the risk and side effects of general anesthesia were much higher, and it could potentially have a negative impact on the newborn's brain. So general anesthesia is not typically recommended unless the circumstances were special. </p><p>Of course, the situation that Huo Mian and Huang Yue were in was considered one of those special circumstances. </p><p>\"Yue, give me her stats.\" </p><p>\"BP 150 over 90, Heart rate 135. Her pulse is a little weak, could be due to the loss of blood.\" </p><p>\"Her blood pressure is a little high. We will have to control that first, and then I will proceed with the C-Section.\" Huo Mian carefully examined the patient's abdomen with gloves on, checking to see if there had been previous c-section scars. </p><p>If this was her first born, she would be able to perform a C-Section right away. However, if this was her second child, then she would need to operate on the same spot as the first surgery to avoid secondary traumatization. </p><p>Huo Mian found a light scar on the patient's abdomen, confirming that she had had a C-section before.</p><p>This complicates the surgery, because the previous wound had already healed, and the scar was very light. </p><p>This surely increased the difficulty of the surgery... </p><p>\"Mian, what's wrong?\" </p><p>\"This is her second child, I need to operate on the previous wound. Pass me the scalpel.\" Huo Mian reached out her hand. </p><p>Huang Yue shook in fear as she passed Huo Mian the scalpel. </p><p>Huo Mian then calmly but accurately cut open the patient's abdomen. </p><p>Huang Yue was too nervous to look... </p><p>\"It's a breech baby, no wonder she's been bleeding so much. Her family's so careless. They should have noticed that the baby was in breech position through an ultrasound. She should have had a C-Section much earlier. Why did they wait until now?\" Huo Mian frowned as she blamed the ignorance of the patient's family.</p><p>\"Breech position? Oh my god, it's dystocia!\" Huang Yue exclaimed.. </p><p>It was already a very complicated surgery to perform, not to mention that there were only two people in the OR, whom were both nurses. </p><p>Huo Mian wasn't given the permission by those above to operate, which means she had already violated hospital policy.  </p><p>But Huo Mian thought, in the eyes of life and death, all rules and regulations were useless because, in the end, lives mattered the most. </p><p>She was confident in her medical skills and was positive that she could keep the patient safe. Therefore, she couldn't think too much of the possible troubles that may lay ahead. </p><p>She would bravely face what was waiting for her in the future. That was her choice today. </p><p>By the time Qin Chu was done with work, it was already late in the night. Without Huo Mian's presence at home, the condo felt extra empty. </p><p>He knew that she wasn't allowed to sleep since she was working a night shift, so he sent her a WeChat message. </p><p>He waited for a while but got no response. Qin Chu thought perhaps Huo Mian was still upset about what happened during the day. </p><p>He then decided to give her a call, but after many rings, no one answered. This further supported his theory that she must be upset. </p><p>So, he put on his jacket and drove to the First Hospital. He even bought some take-out and warm bubble tea as he passed by a Dim Sum restaurant. </p><p>\"Hello, I am looking for Huo Mian from the OB/GYN department,\" Qin Chu asked politely.</p><p>\"Oh yes, please wait! I will immediately contact her for you.\" Very rarely did the receptionist get to see such a handsome man. She answered him enthusiastically as she looked into his eyes, her face blushing.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":133,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:47.433","Link":"Chapter-133","NameDisplay":"Chapter 133"},{"ID":181120948479294798,"Name":"Chapter 134: Birth","NameUnsign":"Chapter 134: Birth","Description":"<p>Chapter 134: Birth</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>After a couple of seconds, the receptionist put down the phone and said apologetically, \"I've called the office line, but no one picked up. Perhaps they're in surgery.\"</p><p>\"Okay, thank you,\" Qin Chu thanked the nurse politely and went straight to the OB/GYN Emergency Room on the fourth floor. </p><p>Qin Chu wore a pair of casual dress pants with a custom-made dark navy dress shirt. In his hand was a bag of take-out. </p><p>He was contemplating how he should coax Huo Mian, but he realized that the door to the OB/GYN office was wide open, with no one inside.</p><p>Huo Mian probably went to check on patients if she's not in the office at this hour. </p><p>Qin Chu thought to himself as he lit a cigarette and leaned against a wall in the hallway as he waited. </p><p>It was late at night with barely anyone at the hospital, so no one would have a problem with him smoking.</p><p>Inside the OR, Huo Mian skillfully took the baby out and snipped its umbilical cord. Then, she finally let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>\"Yue, weigh the newborn, show the baby to the father, and then take it to the newborn clinic.\" </p><p>\"Okay, is it a boy or girl?\" Huang Yue was very excited when she heard the newborn cry.</p><p>\"She's a baby girl.\" </p><p>\"Girls are good. They are like their mothers' little warm blankets. This mother is very lucky,\" said Huang Yue as she took the newborn. She cleaned up the baby and put her on an electronic scale for weighing. </p><p>\"52 centimeters in height, and 9.4 pounds,\" Huang Yue said happily. </p><p>\"9.4 pounds is not a small baby.\" Huo Mian smiled as she wiped the beads of sweat off her forehead. </p><p>\"Yeah, she's a big baby who was in the breech position! No wonder her mother couldn't go through natural labor,\" Huang Yue muttered. </p><p>\"Mian, I'm taking the baby out now, are you okay by yourself in here?\" </p><p>\"I'm fine, you can go.\" Huo Mian began carefully sewing up the patient's wound. She was fast and accurate and finished within twenty minutes. </p><p>After the surgery, Huo Mian looked at the patient's vitals. She let out a sigh of relief when all her stats pointed towards normalcy.</p><p>She then walked out of the OR in hopes of finding the patient's husband to help her push the patient into the recovery room. </p><p>But the hallway was empty, without a soul in sight... </p><p>\"Mian, are you done? How's the patient?\" Huang Yue walked over.</p><p>\"Don't worry, everything's fine. Where's the patient's family?\" </p><p>\"Oh, him. He left in anger as soon as I told him the baby was a girl.\" </p><p>\"He left? How can he leave?\" Huo Mian asked in disbelief. His wife just gave birth. She's still in the OR, and he left? </p><p>\"Did he pay before he left?\" Huang Yue asked fearfully. </p><p>Last year, around this time, it was said that a patient's family left without paying. So, the patient secretly ran away as well. In the end, the ten-thousand-yuan surgical fee was split between the nurses and doctors. This caused quite a bit of trauma to the health care providers. So, the OB/GYN department's chief, Chief Wang, made a decision that patients' families had to pay before an operation, regardless of how serious the situation was. Or else, the hospital would not perform the surgery. </p><p>\"Yes, I saw his deposit slit before operating on his wife.\" Huo Mian was smart, so she wouldn't have allowed a loophole like that to happen. </p><p>Huang Yue let out a sigh of relief as soon as she heard that the fees had been paid. </p><p>\"So what do we do now?\" Clueless, Huang Yue looked at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Let's take the patient to her room, be careful of her wound.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>It took a lot of effort for Huang Yue and Huo Mian to carry the patient off the surgical bed. </p><p>They then pushed her into the ICU for a 24-hour-period of monitoring. After everything was done, Huo Mian returned to the clinic feeling extremely tired. </p><p>From afar, she saw a familiar shadow leaning against the wall in front of the clinic.

She had been busy at work for a while and had tired herself out. </p><p>\"Thanks.\" Rejection became acceptance after some contemplation. </p><p>Huo Mian immediately gave away half of the takeout to Huang Yue when she realized Qin Chu had purchased a very large portion. </p><p>\"Thanks, Big Sis Mian,\" Huang Yue said, and then murmured to Huo Mian, \"Mian, who is he? He's so handsome.\" </p><p>\"A friend,\" Huo Mian lowered her voice and whispered back. </p><p>\"I don't believe you. Would a friend deliver snacks in the middle of the night? Ha, I won't disturb you guys, bye!\" Huang Yue took some food and walked into the office. </p><p>Only Qin Chu and Huo Mian were left in the hallway... </p><p>Huo Mian took a seat on one of the benches on the side, opened the takeout box and took a big bite out of a steamed xiaolongbao. (TL note: Chinese soup dumpling, tastes f*cking good, go try some, eat with vinegar, orgasm in the mouth) </p><p>She finished one in less than three bites and immediately picked up another. </p><p>\"How hungry are you?\" Qin Chu stared at Huo Mian, who ate with no grace. </p><p>\"Very,\" Huo Mian answered truthfully. </p><p>\"Are you still angry about what happened in the afternoon?\" Qin Chu asked. </p><p>\"Afternoon? What happened this afternoon?\" Huo Mian looked surprised, it seemed like she had already forgotten about what had happened. </p><p>\"Oh, never mind,\" said Qin Chu. He didn't need to mention it anymore since the concerned party didn't even remember. </p><p>\"You look really tired. Were you checking on patients?\" </p><p>\"No, I was performing surgery.\" </p><p>\"You performed surgery?\" Qin Chu glanced at Huo Mian in surprise. </p><p>\"That's right. I did.\" </p><p>\"Is this a hospital feature?\" </p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Huo Mian looked confused, as she didn't understand what Qin Chu meant. </p><p>\"Not using a doctor, but instead asking a nurse to perform surgery.\" Qin Cu glanced at Huo Mian with his hands in his pockets. </p><p>\"The doctor ditched work half-way through her shift, and then came this pregnant woman who was experiencing difficult labor. It was an emergency, so I went ahead and did it,\" Huo Mian explained casually to Qin Chu what happened. </p><p>Qin Chu stared at Huo Mian for a while, and said, \"Interesting.\" </p><p>If she were to mention what happened to another person, their first instinct would have been, \"Are you crazy? How can you perform a C-Section on a patient? You're a nurse, for god's sake!\" </p><p>However, Qin Chu was not your average person. After all these years, he knew Huo Mian's personality too well. It was typical for Huo Mian to do something earth-shattering. </p><p>Most importantly, Huo Mian always knew exactly what she was doing. Forget C-Sections, she wouldn't be bogged down even if she had to perform a coronary bypass. He could tell, based on how calm Huo Mian was during that brain surgery as his assistant.</p><p>\"Technically, you did save the patient. But, what you did could be very troublesome. Both the patient and hospital might give you a hard time,\" Qin Chu reminded her kindly. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded and swallowed the xiaolongbao in her mouth, \"I know. But, I didn't have any other choice. I couldn't watch the mother and her baby die in front of me.\" </p><p>Qin Chu's eyes shimmered a little after hearing what she said. </p><p>Huo Mian always looked extremely calm, sometimes even aloof. But deep down, she was a very kind and tender person. Regardless of how tough she appeared to be or how smart she was, she was still a woman. </p><p>Huo Mian broke the rules to save a patient. Her not making a big deal out of what happened wasn't her attempt to be the hero. All she wanted to do was save lives.</p><p>Qin Chu took out a bottle of Evian Spring Water he just purchased, turned open the cap, and passed it to Huo Mian. </p><p>He slowly sat down beside her, \"Mian, remember when you asked me why I went abroad for seven years and studied medicine when I was supposed to inherit the family business? \" </p><p>Huo Mian thought about it for a second and looked Qin Chu in the eye. She was waiting for an answer.</p><p>She really wanted to know why Qin Chu spent seven years doing something that had nothing to do with his current career.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":135,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:48.45","Link":"Chapter-135","NameDisplay":"Chapter 135"},{"ID":181120948489379051,"Name":"Chapter 136: Liking Someone","NameUnsign":"Chapter 136: Liking Someone","Description":"<p>Chapter 136: Liking Someone</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Because your dream is to study medicine,\" Qin Chu said, word for word.</p><p>Huo Mian was completely taken aback by what she heard…</p><p>She never imagined that Qin Chu spent the last seven years studying medicine in the United States only to fulfill her dream.</p><p>This meant that even when they were broken up, he still did things that were related to her.</p><p>He did it for seven years… Was it really worth it?</p><p>Huo Mian was at a loss for words, but tears shone in her eyes…</p><p>She still remembered that seven years ago when they were still together, the topic for one of the Chinese classes they had was \"Ten Years Later\".</p><p>The teacher asked all the students to go up to the podium and imagine what their profession would be in ten years.</p><p>Apparently, doing so would inspire teens to pursue their dreams and work hard for ten years to achieve them.</p><p>A teacher in the United States once conducted the same experiment; in ten years, when he went to check up on his subjects, he noticed that 80% of them chose to do what they said they were going to do.</p><p>Therefore, their homeroom teacher, Ms. Yao, decided to do the same thing.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't remember what the others said, but he would always remember what Huo Mian said, as she stepped onto the podium, with her hair flowing gracefully off her back.</p><p>\"In ten years, I want to become a doctor, because I think that the best thing in this world is to understand the human body, find ways to cure all sorts of diseases, and prolong life.\"</p><p>Some of their classmates laughed at her. \"It's just a doctor, why would you make it sound so complicated?\"</p><p>At that time, Huo Mian replied coldly, \"So, you look down on doctors?

After all, they were young and stupid.</p><p>However, after seven years have passed, Huo Mian was only a nurse, still so far away from her dream.</p><p>Yet Qin Chu quietly helped her achieve it…</p><p>Her brain was pulled back into reality.

There were no accidents.\"</p><p>\"Maybe not this time, but that doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. Even if the patient and her child are doing okay, Huo Mian still violated the hospital's policy. This is a hospital; it's a place of serious business, and we can't have people playing heroines here.

You're just a head nurse! You don't own the hospital, so your disagreement means nothing to anybody. Actually, why don't you leave as well? Our department is under bad leadership, it's time for a change,\" Wu Xiaoxue smoothed out her long curly hair with her fingers as she said aggressively.</p><p>\"I will. If the director fires Huo Mian, I'll resign as well,\" the head nurse responded, her tone icy.</p><p>Huo Mian hurried up to the head nurse. Holding her arm, she said, \"Head Nurse, don't do that. I am the only one to blame for what happened, I don't want you to take fault for it. If the director wants to fire me, I'll leave. You don't have to be caught in the middle.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I heard about what happened last night. You did well; although you violated hospital policy, you saved the mother and her child. I respect you for doing that. On the other hand, there are others who ignored the importance of their jobs and left without notice when they were supposed to be on-call. That's why no one was here to perform surgery on the patient last night. The hospital should be ashamed of that instead.\"</p><p>\"What did you say? I dare you to repeat it.\" Wu Xiaoxue's eyes were near murderous.</p><p>\"Stop it, just stop it. I know that everything happened because of what I did… Last night, before I did what I did, I already anticipated the worst outcome.

I've seen your resume and heard that you are extremely smart. You can learn anything easily if you put your mind to it, can learn things that others would take ten years to learn, and perform outstandingly at any task. The incident that happened last night really opened my eyes to your potential. Therefore, if the hospital offers you a chance to study abroad, would you go?\"</p><p>Gratified, Huo Mian smiled at the director's kind offer.</p><p>\"It's okay, Director Wu.

She slapped Ning Zhiyuan on the face, \"What bullsh*t are you talking about! Did you forget who your girlfriend is!\"</p><p>\"Xiaoxue, that's not what I meant. I just wanted you to treat this calmly.\"</p><p>\"I can't, I need to see my uncle. He can't do this to me. If he won't let me be deputy chief of the department, I will quit. I'm going to tell my dad what my uncle did to me. I'm resigning, I quit! I don't want to be a regular physician, I want to be chief!\"</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue stood in front of the director's office as she howled…</p><p>Director Wu remained unmoved in his office; he was aware of how self-willed his niece was.</p><p>However, he now knew Huo Mian better, and finally understood why Qin Chu would fall for a seemingly-ordinary girl like her. The truth was, she shined in so many different ways.</p><p>\"Director, Miss Wu is creating a scene outside, do you want to see her?\" the assistant, uncomfortable with the situation, asked the director.</p><p>\"Ignore her, let her do her thing. Tell her if she wants to quit, I'll accept her resignation. She's free to leave.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>Just as Wu Xiaoxue and Ning Zhiyuan were fighting, the director's assistant walked out and said in all seriousness, \"Miss Wu, the director said that if you want to quit, he accepts your resignation. You may go now.\"</p><p>\"What? My uncle actually said that?\" Wu Xiaoxue exclaimed in disbelief.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":140,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:50.937","Link":"Chapter-140","NameDisplay":"Chapter 140"},{"ID":181120948514369684,"Name":"Chapter 141: Transferred","NameUnsign":"Chapter 141: Transferred","Description":"<p>Chapter 141: Transferred</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"That is correct.\"</p><p>\"No, I want to see him. I need to ask him for myself!\" Wu Xiaoxue insisted, unwilling to give up.</p><p>In the end, Ning Zhiyuan had to carry her away from the director's office. The scene she was causing was just too embarrassing.</p><p>When Huo Mian and Huang Yue got all their stuff and were about to leave, their colleagues from the OB/GYN department gathered by the doors to send them off.</p><p>Department Chief Wang quietly tugged at Huo Mian's sleeve, \"Good job last night, the surgery was done perfectly.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Chief Wang,\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"When you have the time, I want to treat you to dinner so we can discuss specifics.\"</p><p>\"Um…\" To Huo Mian's surprise, Chief Wang, known for her stellar surgical skills, was offering to treat Huo Mian to dinner to discuss surgical methods.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, stay there for now. Once this incident blows over, I will ask the director to transfer you back.\" The head nurse was sad that Huo Mian was leaving.</p><p>\"Don't worry, Head Nurse, I'm fine anywhere.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, Head Nurse, I'll keep her company. Don't worry.\" Huang Yue, holding a cardboard box, snickered behind Huo Mian.</p><p>She was elated to be transferred to the laboratory.</p><p>She had to cover night-shifts at the OB/GYN department and earned a really low salary. However, working in the lab would be different.</p><p>They would only be drawing blood and conducting tests with equipment that was already there. Most importantly, there were no night-shifts at the lab.</p><p>That means that she would no longer have to stay up all night; it was a great feeling. Technically, the hospital was punishing them, but Huang Yue felt like the director was, on some level, rewarding them.</p><p>Huo Mian sadly bid farewell to her colleagues at the OB/GYN department and headed to the laboratory with Huang Yue.</p><p>The chief physician of the lab was a middle-aged man; he was plump, wore glasses, and had a cute smile. His name was cute too: Han Dongdong.</p><p>\"Chief Han, I'm Huo Mian. Nice to meet you.\"</p><p>\"Oh gosh, you're Huo Mian? Come, sit down.\"</p><p>\"Um… it's fine, I can stand.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense, come and sit down! Tell me, how did you bravely perform the surgery on that pregnant patient last night? I heard that you even knew how to administer anesthesia. Have you studied it before? Why didn't you apply to become a doctor, since there are not many prospects to being a nurse? You're so diligent at work, are you a Virgo? Oh, and what's your favorite color?\"</p><p>Chief Han asked her a series of questions. Confused, Huo Mian wasn't sure which one she was supposed to answer first.</p><p>Finally, she concluded: Chief Han was not only chubby, but he was also talkative.</p><p>However, with a boss like that, her life would be much easier. He seemed amiable.</p><p>Even Huang Yue knew how to draw blood and do tests; naturally, Huo Mian could do it blindfolded. It was easy as pie.</p><p>Everything was fine until she saw Liu Siying at the laboratory. Huo Mian was shocked.</p><p>\"I'm surprised to see you here,\" Liu Siying said coldly when she saw Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian was just as surprised to see her high school classmate – no, rival – on her first day at the lab.</p><p>She wasn't really a romantic rival, because Qin Chu never even looked at her. Just a while back, he made her look bad in their high school WeChat group.</p><p>\"I'm surprised as well,\" Huo Mian replied.</p><p>\"Draw my blood, I've been super sick from the flu and want a routine blood test.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure you want me to do it?\" Huo Mian reinstated.</p><p>\"Of course, I spent the money, aren't you suppose to service me?\" Liu Siying's tone was overbearing.</p><p>\"What I meant was, I don't want you to worry that I might take out my grudge on you.\"</p><p>\"Do you have to guts to?\"</p><p>\"The truth is, I don't like you. So, I won't be too nice when drawing your blood. Just suck it up.\" Then, Huo Mian picked up a needle and pricked it into a vein in Liu Siying's arm.</p><p>That sudden prick hurt a little, causing Liu Siying to furrow her eyebrows.</p><p>\"I heard that you got back together with Qin Chu?\" Liu Siying suddenly asked her.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":141,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:51.437","Link":"Chapter-141","NameDisplay":"Chapter 141"},{"ID":181120948519905715,"Name":"Chapter 142: Romantic Rival","NameUnsign":"Chapter 142: Romantic Rival","Description":"<p>Chapter 142: Romantic Rival</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Who did you hear it from?\" Without looking up, Huo Mian asked calmly as she held onto the tube.</p><p>\"It doesn't matter, just answer my question.\"</p><p>\"Why should I answer you, we're not friends. You're funny.\"</p><p>\"Of course, we've never been friends. We're just romantic rivals.\"</p><p>Huo Mian lifted her head at this and glanced at Liu Siying, \"Correction, we're just rivals, but not of the romantic nature, since you were never a competition when Qin Chu never liked you.\"</p><p>\"We will date, just you wait,\" Liu Siying clenched her teeth as she enunciated to Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Yeah? Good luck.\" Then, Huo Mian pulled out the needle and warned her, \"You should press on it, or else it might swell.\"</p><p>\"Did you do that on purpose?\" Liu Siying asked, a little aggravated.</p><p>\"Of course not, if I were, I wouldn't be able to find your vein on the first try. I'd poke you again and again until I destroy it.\"</p><p>\"You're a vicious b*tch,\" Liu Siying cursed.</p><p>\"But I didn't, did I?\" Huo Mian smiled; she wasn't angry at all.</p><p>Before she left, Liu Siying looked at Huo Mian and said, \"Huo Mian, you're just as arrogant as you used to be. But I won't give up. Just you wait, one day, Qin Chu will be mine.\"</p><p>\"Sounds good, I hope you never wake up from your fantasy.\"</p><p>Liu Siying, furious at what Huo Mian said, turned around and stomped away.</p><p>Huo Mian laughed; it was like she was back in high school, fighting with Liu Siying.</p><p>Actually, she didn't hate Liu Siying at all, but for some reason Liu Siying always treated her like an enemy.</p><p>At least Liu Siying was open and straightforward. She always said what she had on her mind, even if it wasn't easy to the ears. She would never do things behind another person's back.</p><p>There's an old saying, 'offend the gentleman, never the petty man.'</p><p>Therefore, Huo Mian felt that at the very least, Liu Siying was a worthy rival.</p><p>While having lunch in the cafeteria, other people kept pointing at Huo Mian. There were compliments but also criticisms.</p><p>Some complimented her surgical skills and said that she was a rare talent.</p><p>Others criticized that she was playing with fire and that she will be kicked out of the hospital, sooner or later.</p><p>However, Huo Mian didn't care about what they said.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, aren't you mad that people are discussing you?\" Huang Yue asked quietly.</p><p>\"Why should I be angry? It's my life. If I care too much about what other people think, my life will become like old underwear, having to endure others' farts.\"</p><p>\"Hahaha, you are so cute! I would definitely marry you if I were a guy.\" Huang Yue laughed hysterically at Huo Mian's remarks.</p><p>\"Forget it, I wouldn't marry you if you were a guy.\"</p><p>The duo chatted on and didn't realize that someone was heading towards them.</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue was emotionally unstable, so she ditched work to go home and rest.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan himself was also emotionally and physically drained; he wasn't in the mood to work all morning and didn't even want to eat lunch.</p><p>However, he heard from his colleagues in the Ophthalmology Department that Huo Mian was in the cafeteria, so for some reason, he came down to see her.</p><p>\"Mian, I heard what you did last night, you did well.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was laughing along with Huang Yue; when she saw that it was Ning Zhiyuan standing behind her, her beautiful smile immediately disappeared.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" she replied, her tone distant.</p><p>\"Can I speak to you alone for a second? I need to talk to you,\" Ning Zhiyuan asked with difficulty and deliberately casted a look at Huang Yue.</p><p>Huang Yue, scared to make the decision, glanced back at Huo Mian as if she was asking for Huo Mian's opinion.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":142,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:51.99","Link":"Chapter-142","NameDisplay":"Chapter 142"},{"ID":181120948524482301,"Name":"Chapter 143: Offering Money","NameUnsign":"Chapter 143: Offering Money","Description":"<p>Chapter 143: Offering Money</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"No, it's fine, just say it here.

Hurry up, I'm a little busy. I have to go back to work in a bit,\" Huo Mian said after checking the time on her phone.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan looked at Huo Mian; with a low and secretive voice, he said, \"I'm going to an ophthalmology-related medical seminar in Hong Kong next month.\"</p><p>\"That's good news, congratulations.\"</p><p>\"But everyone's supposed to bring a new academic paper they've written… you know that you were the one who helped me with those in the past, so I was wondering if you could help me again this time…\"</p><p>Huo Mian understood immediately – his attitude towards her was good because he needed something from her.</p><p>\"Sorry, I can't help you.\"</p><p>\"Mian, please.\"</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, you can't rely on others forever. You have a lot of time on your hands, why don't you do some research in the field of ophthalmology? Seriously, if you put your heart into studying and research, you'll succeed. After all, no one can steal knowledge away from you.\"</p><p>\"But I don't have the talent. I know that you're a genius.\"</p><p>\"I may be a genius, but that doesn't mean that I have to help you.\"</p><p>\"I can give you money if you help me write one more paper. How does 30,000 yuan sound?\"</p><p>Huo Mian smiled… Her smile containing complicated meanings.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan couldn't tell what Huo Mian was thinking, so he upped his offer, \"What about 50,000 yuan? You'd be able to buy a Chery car for your brother with that kind of money. He loves cars, doesn't he? You should think about it.\" </p><p>\"Zhiyuan, you probably didn't know, but I… I'm not poor anymore. I'm not in need of money.\"</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan kept emphasizing money, so Huo Mian told him this information with a smile on her face.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan hesitated for a second after remembering that Qin Chu person, \"Oh right, how can I forget? You have a super-rich-ex-boyfriend, of course you don't need money.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't have anything to do with money… either way, I can't help you.\"</p><p>\"Women, what a heartless bunch. I can't believe that you won't help me just because we're broken up. It's such a realistic tragedy,\" Ning Zhiyuan sneered when he heard that Huo Mian wouldn't help him.</p><p>Huo Mian was unhappy and refuted, \"Is the pot calling the kettle black? I remember that you did the same thing to me.\"</p><p>When her brother needed surgery and she was in dire need of money, he refused to even lend her a penny. Huo Mian knew that if she helped Ning Zhiyuan, she would be the stupidest person on Earth.</p><p>Then, Huo Mian stood up and left, leaving her unfinished food where it was…</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan had a feeling that Huo Mian changed completely.</p><p>She was no longer gentle nor low-key. She wouldn't even smile at him.</p><p>After getting home from work, Huo Mian noticed that Qin Chu was there as well.</p><p>\"Congrats, you don't have to work night shifts anymore,\" Qin Chu said proudly.</p><p>\"Um… how did you know?\" Huo Mian didn't remember telling him about being transferred out of the OB/GYN department.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":143,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:52.45","Link":"Chapter-143","NameDisplay":"Chapter 143"},{"ID":181120948529618016,"Name":"Chapter 144: Relationship","NameUnsign":"Chapter 144: Relationship","Description":"<p>Chapter 144: Relationship</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I had lunch with Wu Zhongxing today.\"</p><p>Huo Mian felt the hairs on her arms stand up…</p><p>\"Okay, so you asked Director Wu not to fire me?\"</p><p>\"Of course not.

Let's go out.\"</p><p>\"No, restaurant food is too oily; let's have a home-cooked meal instead. I'll cook,\" Huo Mian ran into the kitchen after changing out of her work clothes.</p><p>Qin Chu sat in the living room, his hand scrolling down the financial page with his laptop.</p><p>He had always dreamed of a simple and peaceful life like this.</p><p>Tomato egg stir-fry, spare-ribs with brown sauce, and borsch soup. There were meat and vegetables – a perfect combination.</p><p>Huo Mian was a talented chef, so the food she made was delicious as well.</p><p>Qin Chu, unlike himself, finished off two whole bowls of rice.</p><p>\"I saw Liu Siying today,\" Huo Mian mentioned unintentionally.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't reply; he wasn't interested in the person in question…</p><p>\"She said that she won't give up and will keep fighting me until you guys end up together,\" Huo Mian secretly glanced at Qin Chu's expression as she said this.</p><p>\"She is quite imaginative. You should ask her if she wants to go to Mars, I heard that there are openings for dreamers there.\"</p><p>\"You shouldn't say that. People need dreams because there's a chance that it may come true one day.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>Qin Chu immediately looked up and looked at her with a dim expression. His tone was cold, \"This dream of hers will never come true.\"</p><p>\"Haha, I'm just joking around, don't be so serious.\" Huo Mian found it incredibly funny to see Qin Chu mad. It was a rare sighting, him being stubborn with such a grim expression.</p><p>\"Well, don't make silly jokes like that in the future,\" Qin Chu scolded.</p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to refute, her phone began to ring.</p><p>She picked up the phone, but before she could say anything, she heard the voice of a woman crying on the other end of the line.</p><p>\"Lingling, what happened?\" Huo Mian was worried.</p><p>On the other end, Zhu Lingling refused to speak; she just kept crying…</p><p>\"Lingling, stop crying for a second and tell me what happened.\" Anxious, Huo Mian picked up the phone and stood up from her chair.</p><p>\"Mian… I really… really want to kill myself right now.\" Zhu Lingling's voice was hoarse.</p><p>Huo Mian's heart jumped; immediately, she asked, \"Lingling, where are you right now?

He has a good job; he's a high-level construction engineer. I always thought that nerds like him would be dull meatheads, but he's not like that. He's funny and sophisticated, and most importantly, he pays attention to the small details. He treats me very well and is willing to spend money on me. He bought me tons of luxury presents. You know that women are all prideful creatures, although I like luxury goods, I rarely buy them myself. Once he found out, he bought me a bunch of them.\"</p><p>\"Then you found out that the stuff he bought you were knock-offs?\" Huo Mian randomly asked.</p><p>\"Of course not, why would you think that?\" Zhu Lingling looked helplessly at Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled, \"I'm just pulling your leg.

I don't want to be a flight attendant anymore, I want to have a family of my own, and have my own baby.\"</p><p>\"Seriously, what's the point here? This is a lot of pretext, we're not in a romance novel,\" Huo Mian exclaimed.</p><p>\"The point is, I found out that he's married, and has a wife.\" Then, Zhu Lingling began wailing again. Huo Mian could tell that she was truly heartbroken.</p><p>\"So, you were the mistress?\" Huo Mian looked at her best friend sympathetically.</p><p>\"Yeah, and his wife called me and told me a lot of stuff over the phone.\"</p><p>\"Did she yell at you?\" Huo Mian asked.</p><p>Zhu Lingling shook her head, \"I wish. You know that I'm good at verbal confrontations and rarely ever lose in them. She didn't yell at me but was actually really polite. I could tell that she's a very sophisticated and well-educated woman. She told me about their relationship and that they have two adorable girls. They used to be a happy family.\"</p><p>\"So, you felt guilty and decided to pull away?\" Huo Mian guessed that her good friend was probably a good enough person not to continue being the other woman.</p><p>\"Wrong, she didn't ask me to pull away. She asked me to convince that asshole to divorce her.\"</p><p>\"So, you're saying that his wife wants you to convince your boyfriend to divorce her?\" This turn of events definitely surprised Huo Mian.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":146,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:53.933","Link":"Chapter-146","NameDisplay":"Chapter 146"},{"ID":181120948544312444,"Name":"Chapter 147: Asshole","NameUnsign":"Chapter 147: Asshole","Description":"<p>Chapter 147: Asshole</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Zhu Lingling nodded, \"She said that she's had enough over the years. Their love died a long time ago, and she wants to take their daughters and immigrate to Canada, but that asshole won't sign the divorce papers.\"</p><p>\"From that, you can clearly see how much of an asshole that guy is. Even his wife feels the need to beg some other woman to divorce him,\" Huo Mian calmly analyzed.</p><p>Zhu Lingling smiled bitterly, \"You're right. It was so uncalled for. Later when I asked him why he deceived me and didn't tell me that he was married and had children, guess what he told me.\"</p><p>\"I bet he told you that he and his wife's relationship has been bad for years, and they have no feelings left for each other. However, his wife would not agree to a divorce, am I right? Oh right, he probably asked you to wait for him, and promised you that he'll marry you one day.\"</p><p>After hearing Huo Mian's remarks, Zhu Lingling looked at her with admiration, \"No wonder you're a genius, you basically replicated what he said to me. If his wife hadn't called me, I would have been kept in the dark forever. It was him that refused to divorce, but he made it sound like his wife was the one who wouldn't let go.\"</p><p>\"Wait, Lingling. Can I ask why he doesn't want to divorce his wife? If there's no love left in their marriage, then why cling onto it? Does he have a personal agenda? Is his wife super rich?\" Huo Mian guessed.</p><p>Zhu Lingling was so shocked that she almost pounced on Huo Mian, \"How did you know that?\"</p><p>\"It was a simple deduction.\" Huo Mian smiled lightly.</p><p>\"Well, your deduction was right. His wife is really rich and earns more money than him. She owns a lot of shop fronts in the city; even if she doesn't do anything, she would still earn about 5 million yuan in rent each month.\"</p><p>\"No wonder he wouldn't divorce her. But I'm curious, if she knows and has proof of him cheating, then the court would usually approve their divorce. His wife shouldn't act like this.\" Huo Mian was confused again.</p><p>\"That's the reason why I despise him. He threatened his wife; he hid their five-year-old daughter, and since it's a husband-wife problem, the police refused to interfere. He's worried that he might lose his wallet, and that's why he used their child to threaten his wife.\"</p><p>\"Wow, he is the king of assholes.\" Huo Mian sighed.</p><p>\"Mian, why do I have such bad karma?\"</p><p>\"I think you should be happy that you found out the truth. You shouldn't be killing yourself over it.\"</p><p>\"I should be happy?\" Zhu Lingling asked helplessly.</p><p>\"Finding this out earlier on and being able to take precaution is a good thing, isn't it? If you didn't find out and jumped right into the hole he dug you, things would be so much worse.\"</p><p>\"So… what should I do now?\" Zhu Lingling asked sadly, her head lowered.</p><p>\"There's nothing else to do. Of course, you need to break up with him. Sever all communications and tell that asshole to get the hell away from you.\"</p><p>\"But he won't agree to that.\"</p><p>\"Are you stupid? Who cares if he doesn't agree? You guys are just dating; rather, you were just his mistress. Your relationship isn't even legal.\"</p><p>\"But he said that he loves me very much.\"</p><p>\"What if I told you that Qin Chu told me that he was in love with you? Would you believe that?\" Huo Mian looked furious.</p><p>Zhu Lingling was immediately startled, \"Stop joking around, big sister, I don't have the guts to piss a guy like him off.\"</p><p>\"So you're telling me that you won't believe bullsh*t?\"</p><p>\"I know what you mean, it's just that I put a lot of time and effort into this relationship. It just hurts.\"</p><p>\"That's normal. There are so many assholes out there nowadays, just treat it like a lesson learned. You live and you learn, right? Just remember that in the future.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, this was a bloody lesson learn alright. Trust me, I'll remember,\" Zhu Lingling said with red eyes.</p><p>\"Now, you have to take a shower and get some sleep. Don't think about anything else.\"</p><p>\"No, it's fine. I feel uncomfortable staying at your home,\" Zhu Lingling said as she got up.</p><p>However, Huo Mian pulled her back down, \"Qin Chu isn't home, just stay.\"</p><p>\"Thank god you're with me at a time like this,\" Zhu Lingling suddenly hugged Huo Mian, sincerely thanking her best friend.</p><p>\"Don't mention it. We've known each other for years; every time something happens to me, you're the first one to step up, aren't you?\" Huo Mian said as she patted her back.</p><p>\"Yeah, but I don't worry about you. As long as Qin Chu's here, nothing will happen to you. It was like this seven years ago, and it is still like this seven years later. Mian, Qin Chu is so good to you, don't you think?\"</p><p>\"I do.\"</p><p>\"What about you? What's on your mind? Are you still planning to divorce him?\" Zhu Lingling quietly asked.</p><p>Huo Mian's expression dimmed upon hearing her question…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":147,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:54.433","Link":"Chapter-147","NameDisplay":"Chapter 147"},{"ID":181120948549998474,"Name":"Chapter 148: Incident","NameUnsign":"Chapter 148: Incident","Description":"<p>Chapter 148: Incident</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Hey, you're barely out of the woods, let's not talk about me. Are you hungry? I can make you some food.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling knew that Huo Mian was instinctively avoiding her question, which meant that there was still something between her and Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Yeah, I am. Can you make me some instant noodles?\"</p><p>\"I don't have junk food like that at home, have some hot noodle soup instead. I'll make you some, one second.\"</p><p>With that, Huo Mian put on her apron and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>With Huo Mian's company, Zhu Lingling became much more emotionally stable. After some noodle soup, she took a hot shower and fell right asleep.</p><p>The next day, they left the condo together – Huo Mian headed to work, and Zhu Lingling headed home.</p><p>Before they parted, Huo Mian was still worried so she reminded Zhu Lingling again, \"Remember what I told you. Delete and block him from WeChat and your phone. You need to cut off all methods of communication, or else you'll just suffer more. If you still can't snap out of it, then his wife's life will become yours in the future.\"</p><p>\"I know, girl, don't worry. Thanks for taking care of me last night.\"</p><p>\"Just go home. Call me if you need anything.\"</p><p>After saying goodbye to Zhu Lingling, Huo Mian went to the First Hospital.</p><p>Work at the laboratory was simple; plus, they weren't busy because there were a lot of people on-call.</p><p>The employees at the lab were really nice to Huo Mian and Huang Yue, much to Huang Yue's elation.</p><p>When they had the time, she and Huo Mian would gossip about random things.</p><p>\"Hey, Mian, the pregnant patient who you performed surgery on the other day is being discharged. They ran tests on her baby, and she's doing well also.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that's good. When I passed by the newborn clinic, I saw her baby. She's very healthy,\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"Actually, she has you to thank. If it weren't for you, she and her baby would have died. While we're on that subject, that patient is really ungrateful. She didn't even thank you after the surgery, and she's acting as if we owed it to her or something.\"</p><p>\"You can't hold that against her. She's probably weak after surgery and isn't in the right state of mind.\"</p><p>Huang Yue immediately refuted, \"So even if she doesn't know how to say 'thank you', what about her family? His husband knelt that night and begged us to save them. Now that he found out that the baby is a girl, he disappeared from the hospital and was never seen again. I heard that it was the patient's own family that came today to pick her up, her husband's family didn't even show up. It sucks that this society looks down upon girls.\" </p><p>Huo Mian felt the same way, \"These old ideologies have taken so much away from women. If we all gave birth to boys, then who will they marry in the future? Humans will cease to exist.\"</p><p>\"Haha, right? These people are all idiots. But that's okay, women will become more and more valuable, you know what they say – scarcity equals value. My mom told me that when I get married, we need more than a hundred thousand yuan in gifts, and the guy must own a house and a car. There are 30 million single men in our country, we have the right to be stubborn and picky.\"</p><p>Huo Mian smiled without saying anything…</p><p>\"Mian, since your boyfriend is so rich, when you guys get married, the ceremony will be grand and fabulous, won't it?\" Huang Yue suddenly asked.</p><p>\"Um…I don't think so. We don't like to be flashy.\"</p><p>She thought back at the day she and Qin Chu got their marriage license; it wasn't grand nor fabulous.</p><p>But that was her wish anyway, the fewer people that knew, the better.</p><p>If their relationship went public, Qin Chu's mother and her mother would explode. Then, the world will probably fall into chaos.</p><p>She didn't even want to think about it.</p><p>Then, her phone rang. She looked down at her phone and saw the caller ID. Her expression softened.</p><p>\"Zhixin.\"</p><p>\"Sis, I'm going back to school. I know it hasn't been a month yet, but I'm feeling much better. I'm so bored at home.\"</p><p>\"Okay, sounds good. Be careful and remember to get enough rest.\"</p><p>\"I got it, Sis. I wanted to let you know because I don't want you to worry.\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"Then I'm going to head out for class. Come back for dinner this week, don't forget it's our mom's birthday.\"</p><p>\"Yup, I remember.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>After she hung up, she began thinking about what present she should buy her mom for her birthday.</p><p>However, she was suddenly disrupted by a loud commotion outside…</p><p>\"Huo Mian, who the f*ck is Huo Mian?

Her name was rare, so when people called out for 'Huo Mian', it was usually her.</p><p>Then, she saw a couple of big men walking towards her, fury written all over their faces.</p><p>Ignoring the security guard's efforts to stop them, they stopped in front of the laboratory.</p><p>\"Who's Huo Mian, come the f*ck out.\" The leader of the group had a big head and was wearing a gold chain around his neck. He looked monstrous.</p><p>\"I am, may I help you?\"</p><p>\"You're Huo Mian?\" The man reconfirmed.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded. She looked at the four men in front of her and confirmed that she didn't know any of them.</p><p>\"Well, that makes things easier. We are the family members of patient Yuan Fenfen. I'm her oldest brother. I heard that my sister was hospitalized a couple of days ago, and you performed a C-section on her, am I right?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Huo Mian was calm.</p><p>\"Are you a doctor?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"I heard that you're just a nurse, an intern nurse at that, right?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>Huang Yue secretly tugged at the corner of Huo Mian's lab coat, reminding her to say no more.</p><p>\"So, you're just a f*cking intern nurse. Who gave you the right to perform surgery on my sister, huh? Were you experimenting with my little sister and treating her like a lab rat?\"</p><p>\"It's not like that. It was an emergency, and her baby was in a breech position. She was about to bleed out, and I had no other choice. I only did it to save her and her baby.\"</p><p>\"F*ck that! I never heard that a hospital would let a nurse perform surgery, have all the doctors died? Hm, let me ask you, where were the doctors in this big as* hospital?\"</p><p>\"The on-call doctor had an emergency so she couldn't be there, and there was no time to transfer your sister to another hospital. You should ask your brother-in-law about it, he agreed to it,\" Huo Mian explained word for word.</p><p>\"I asked my brother-in-law, and he told me that he had no idea you were just a nurse. If he had known that you weren't a doctor, then… he would never let you perform surgery on my sister, not even if her life was in danger.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's expression changed…</p><p>If memory served her right, when that patient's husband went to pay the surgical fees that night, she told him that the on-call doctor wasn't here and that the surgery would be risky. However, that man kept on begging Huo Mian, willing to do anything to save his wife and baby. Yet, he had changed his statement… How interesting.</p><p>Huang Yue was agitated and stood up, \"What do you mean? Huo Mian and I were nice enough to save your family, and now you're saying this? Did you know that if she didn't operate on your sister at that time, she would be a corpse by now!\"</p><p>\"B*llshit! Don't think I don't understand what's happening here, we're not stupid! You are just nurses, and to fulfill your own agenda, you used my sister like a lab rat, and this despicable hospital is covering it up for you! Let me tell you, my sister hasn't been discharged yet, and she's obviously not feeling well. Trust me, you will be made responsible for any side effects she may have.\"</p><p>\"I checked up on your sister, she's doing fine and will soon be discharged.\"</p><p>\"Impossible, my sister was just saying that she felt dizzy and can't be discharged anymore. Your hospital and you irresponsible lot conducted an experiment on a patient. You have to provide an explanation for my family.\"</p><p>\"Explanation? What kind of explanation are you looking for?\" Huo Mian seemed to realize what the patient's family was here for.</p><p>\"You and your hospital have to provide compensation to my sister accordingly.\"</p><p>Of course.

The patient and her child were recovering well, but they're suddenly here, causing a scene. Someone must have given them the idea.</p><p>As expected, as soon as Huo Mian asked, the expression of the leader of the group, the so-called brother of the patient, changed.</p><p>\"What do you mean by 'led the way'? It's not like that at all. My sister is not feeling well, and I wanted to talk to her surgeon about it, but none of the many doctors in the OB/GYN department admitted to performing the surgery.

You're just an intern nurse, how dare you operate on my sister!

If it weren't for Mian, your sister wouldn't have survived to see her daughter. Who's the evil person here?\" Huang Yue was so furious that her face turned purple.</p><p>\"Yue, don't talk anymore.\" Huo Mian stopped Huang Yue; she didn't want her to fight with the patient's family.</p><p>Just then, the hospital security arrived and dragged the men out of the lab.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, what happened?\" Chief Han walked over.</p><p>\"Chief, something happened at the OB/GYN department. I think I need to go back and check.\"</p><p>\"That's fine, go.\" Chief Han was easy to talk to and immediately granted Huo Mian's leave.</p><p>Huo Mian and Huang Yue headed towards the OB/GYN building. The only question in her mind was: was the patient suffering from side effects?</p><p>- OB/GYN building -</p><p>Huo Mian was on her way to the patient's room when she saw the head nurse.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I was just about to go find you.\"</p><p>\"You wanted to talk to me about that pregnant patient, right?\"</p><p>The head nurse nodded, \"Yes, I heard that the patient's family caused quite a scene at the lab.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, they kept saying that the patient is experiencing side effects and is too dizzy to be discharged. They wanted the hospital to provide them with an explanation.\"</p><p>The head nurse's expression wasn't good, and she said in all seriousness, \"That complicates things. We thought that the patient would be okay and this incident would be buried, but her family found out that she isn't feeling well.\"</p><p>\"Did something really happen to the patient?\" Huo Mian thought that her operation was successful and the patient should be fine.</p><p>The head nurse shook her head. She pulled Huo Mian to the side and whispered, \"It's not as easy as it looks. I looked at the patient's vitals too, nothing's wrong with her and she can be discharged. But the patient kept saying that she's dizzy and not feeling well, but we didn't find anything abnormal on the tests we ran. I suspect that this was a planned extortion.

It's just like when murderers kill someone, they insist that they were insane. We can't just believe anything you say, and you will need proof to back up your allegations.\"</p><p>The patient fell silent upon hearing what Huo Mian said.</p><p>\"I know that you're not like that. You were there that night, you know what happened. You were bleeding out and needed a blood transfusion. At the time no one was there to perform the surgery, and your husband knelt on the floor, begging me to do it. As the on-call nurse, I didn't want a patient to die in front of me. I only agreed to the surgery because I was confident in my skills. Moreover, I knew that if I performed the surgery, it might come back and bite me like it did today. However, I can't believe that you, the patient, would act like this as well. I don't expect you to thank me, but you can't wrong me, do you understand?\"</p><p>The patient seemed moved by what Huo Mian said…</p><p>Huo Mian could tell that she was struggling…</p><p>Huo Mian continued, \"I know that it's not easy being a woman. This is your second child, right? Your husband was really angry when he found out that it was a girl, and your in-laws didn't even come to the hospital to check up on you.\"</p><p>The patient looked up in surprise; Huo Mian's speculation was correct.</p><p>\"I don't know much about your family background, but your brother kept bringing up the topic of compensation. It seems like he wants to take the opportunity to obtain a large amount of money. Your husband doesn't seem like the type to mastermind something like this. I heard that you guys hired a lawyer, so my question is this: who is instigating all of this behind the scenes?\"</p><p>\"I…\" The patient looked at Huo Mian in awe.</p><p>Every sentence Huo Mian said went straight to her heart…</p><p>\"No one instigated anything, it's not what you think.\"</p><p>\"Ms. Yuan Fenfen, please have a heart. I don't want to say anything overbearing, but I need to tell you that the gods up there are watching. I don't expect anything in return for saving you and your child, but you wronging me today has negatively affected me and the hospital. Therefore, I hope that you can stop before it's too late. If you want compensation, I can pay you out of my own pocket. But please do not discredit the hospital. Our director is an extremely respectable man, and I don't want my so-called heroism to affect him, is that okay?\"</p><p>Huo Mian knew that this family wanted nothing more than money…</p><p>If they really needed it, then she was happy to pay them if they agreed to shut the whole thing down quietly.</p><p>However, if things became worse, it would affect the hospital's reputation; then, she would feel even more guilty.</p><p>The patient seemed to be moved. With tears in her eyes, she said, \"I didn't want to do this, but…\"</p><p>However, before she could finish, the door was smashed open.</p><p>Then, Huo Mian saw the patient's husband by the door. He began yelling at her, \"Why are you here? Are you here to threaten my wife? You're an evil nurse with no heart, I swear I'm going to sue you and this hospital. Don't even think about settling this with a few thousand yuan. Our lawyer said that the hospital has to pay us millions in compensation, or else no one's getting off so easy!\"</p><p>\"When you knelt on the floor and begged me to save your wife that night, your attitude was nothing like this.\" Huo Mian looked at the patient's husband with a cold stare.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":152,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:57.8","Link":"Chapter-152","NameDisplay":"Chapter 152"},{"ID":181120948583254788,"Name":"Chapter 153: Compensation","NameUnsign":"Chapter 153: Compensation","Description":"<p>Chapter 153: Compensation</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>The husband seemed to be a little embarrassed and he cursed, \"Stop your nonsense. Anyways, get the f*ck out of here and don't threaten my wife again. My wife is experiencing severe side effects right now, and none of you will be able to escape from responsibility.\"</p><p>\"So, you want this thing to blow up? You are set on blackmailing the hospital out of millions?\" Huo Mian demanded coldly.</p><p>\"That's right, we're going to blow it up so big for the entire city to know.\"</p><p>\"Fine, but don't regret it.\"</p><p>\"Of course we won't, your threats don't work on us. We're not scared of you. You're just a nurse who's living out her intern years, stop pretending to be high and mighty. Hmph, I will fight you to the death.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll be waiting.\" Huo Mian pursed her lips and walked away.</p><p>As soon as she left the room, the patient's husband grabbed her off her bed and slapped her right on her face.</p><p>\"Are you a f*cking idiot? Did you think you could talk sh*t in front of that woman? Aren't you afraid that she was recording you? If you screw up my plans and I end up with no money, I will f*cking suffocate you.\" The patient's husband bared his ugly face at his wife.</p><p>\"Honey, can't we just let it go? I don't want to do this anymore. I don't feel good about it. She's a good person who saved our daughter and me. We should be thanking her, not doing this to her,\" the patient sobbed as she said this.</p><p>The husband, however, remained unconvinced. Instead, he pointed at his wife and began cursing at her, \"I'm telling you, don't ruin it for me. We've already started, so we're seeing this through. The hospital has to compensate us! Once we're rich, the rest of our lives will be covered.\"</p><p>\"But that money doesn't even belong to us in the first place, I...\" the patient tried to refute.</p><p>Her husband immediately reached out and grabbed her by her neck, \"You stupid woman, you're an idiot who can't even give me a son. I shouldn't have begged them that night, I should've let you die. You're a chicken who can't lay male eggs, I'm disgusted. Let me tell you, you have to listen to me on this. If you don't cooperate, I will leave you and our home, and I will divorce you. There are so many women out there, I'm sure there will be others out there willing to give me a son. Then, you and your two money-burning daughters can get the f*ck back to your mother's house.\"</p><p>Fear flashed in the patient's eyes when she heard the word 'divorce'.</p><p>When she married him, she decided to never get divorced. Life as a woman was hard. Over the past few years, she had to do chores and take care of her family; her husband was working at a menial job with a low income, and they lived stringently.</p><p>Her husband and his parents really wanted sons to bear their family name. They were already unhappy that their first child was a daughter.</p><p>After much effort, she became pregnant with their second child. They were told during the ultrasounds that it was a boy, but once the baby was born, they found out that their newborn was just another \"money-burning b*tch\".</p><p>Her husband was pissed off; if it weren't for his plan to coerce Huo Mian and the hospital, he probably wouldn't even show his face at the hospital.</p><p>If he knew that his wife would bear him another girl, he would not have knelt and begged that little nurse to save her that night.</p><p>He felt cheated, and after he was enlightened by a 'wise person', he immediately thought that it would be a good idea.</p><p>Therefore, he and the patient's family teamed up to cause trouble at the hospital, just so they would receive a giant compensation.</p><p>\"How did it go?\" the head nurse asked when she saw Huo Mian walk out of the patient's room.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"They're determined to get the hospital to pay.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry too much, Director Wu will resolve things when he comes back,\" the head nurse comforted her.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded. After saying goodbye to the head nurse, she headed back to the lab.</p><p>The OB/GYN department was unusually quiet these days; apparently, Wu Xiaoxue took some time off and hadn't been to work in days.</p><p>She seemed to be extremely unhappy with her punishment, but Director Wu had already made his decision. </p><p>He told her that if she didn't want to stay, she was free to resign. She and her uncle were in a cold war.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan, on the other hand, was indifferent towards her since she rejected his request.</p><p>Not long after Huo Mian returned to the lab did she realize that it was time to go home.</p><p>Chief Han walked up and quietly warned her, \"Mian, you should leave from the back door today.\"</p><p>\"What wrong?\" puzzled, Huo Mian asked Chief Han.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":153,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:58.327","Link":"Chapter-153","NameDisplay":"Chapter 153"},{"ID":18112094858840503,"Name":"Chapter 154: Vacation","NameUnsign":"Chapter 154: Vacation","Description":"<p>Chapter 154: Vacation</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"When I went out just now, I saw those unreasonable family members outside the door.

Thank you, Chief Han.\"</p><p>\"Don't mention it, and don't revel in it too much, the director will definitely do something about it. They won't get anything from causing a scene out there.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>Huo Mian packed up her things and left the hospital from the back door with Huang Yue.</p><p>Chief Han was right; it was much quieter to leave from the back door.</p><p>Huo Mian, her mind a mess, decided to walk home. It took her about 15 minutes to get back to Imperial Park.</p><p>It was still early, so their condo was empty. Qin Chu wasn't back yet.</p><p>Huo Mian put down her bag. Exhausted, she fell onto the couch and closed her eyes to rest for a bit.</p><p>Suddenly, she remembered something. She took out her phone and called Zhu Lingling, but her phone was off.</p><p>Nervous, she logged onto WeChat. As soon as she did, she saw Zhu Lingling's message.</p><p>\"Girl, I'm at work. I'm flying south today, don't worry about me.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was relieved that Zhu Lingling went to work…</p><p>She thought about what happened at the hospital today and began developing a headache.</p><p>Her mind ran wild, and she completely forgot about making dinner.</p><p>It wasn't until she heard the sound of the door unlocking and Qin Chu entering did she snap back to reality.</p><p>\"You're back? I'll go make dinner,\" Huo Mian said as she headed towards the kitchen.</p><p>When she passed by Qin Chu, he grabbed her hand.</p><p>\"You don't look well.\"</p><p>\"Oh, it was really busy today, I think I'm just too tired,\" Huo Mian replied vaguely.</p><p>\"Then don't make dinner, let's go out to eat.\"</p><p>\"I don't have much of an appetite, but you can go out for some food yourself.\"</p><p>\"It's fine, I'm not hungry either. Forget dinner, let's rest for a while.\" Before Huo Mian could respond, Qin Chu dragged her to the couch and had her sit.</p><p>Then, Qin Chu took out an apple from the fridge for Huo Mian. He turned on the TV and randomly picked a channel.</p><p>Afterwards, he took off his suit jacket and took out his laptop. He then began working beside her.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't want to eat. She held the apple Qin Chu gave her, and, overcome with boredom, began watching TV.</p><p>They didn't speak to each other, as Qin Chu was focused on his company's reports and stocks.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, stared at the TV screen as the apple sat quietly in her hands.</p><p>They quietly felt the time pass by.</p><p>Huo Mian occasionally looked at Qin Chu's perfect profile; her heart was filled with warmth.</p><p>She liked and enjoyed his companionship…</p><p>However, she constantly felt like their relationship was in crisis mode. She didn't believe that they would be able to spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p>It seemed that the tragedy that happened seven years ago made sure that their relationship would be forever burdened with heavy baggage.</p><p>Qin Chu, sensing Huo Mian's stare, suddenly turned his face towards her. Looking into her eyes, he asked, \"Are you enjoying your show?\"</p><p>\"Take a look at it for yourself.\"</p><p>Qin Chu looked up and froze…</p><p>It was the cartoon, Bonnie Bear.</p><p>\"You can switch channels if you want to,\" he said.</p><p>\"No, it's fine, I like this show.\"</p><p>Qin Chu was speechless upon hearing Huo Mian's response.</p><p>He truly found it hard to believe that someone with an IQ as high as 130 would watch a children's cartoon show.</p><p>After Qin Chu worked for another hour, he turned off his laptop.</p><p>He looked at Huo Mian, who appeared exhausted. Giving some thought, he asked her, \"Do you want to go on a vacation together?\"</p><p>\"A vacation?\" Huo Mian was dazed.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":154,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:48:58.84","Link":"Chapter-154","NameDisplay":"Chapter 154"},{"ID":18112094859310678,"Name":"Chapter 155: Blame","NameUnsign":"Chapter 155: Blame","Description":"<p>Chapter 155: Blame</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I'm going on a business trip to Taipei.

The voice was somewhat familiar.</p><p>\"Yes, it is. Who am I speaking with?\"</p><p>\"My name is Lin Mingyu.\"</p><p>\"Lin Mingyu?\" Huo Mian was a little confused. She didn't remember knowing someone with this name.</p><p>\"I'm the forensics guy you went out with last time,\" he emphasized.</p><p>\"Oh, it's you.\" Huo Mian remembered. It was that guy the head nurse introduced her to last time.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Lin Mingyu asked Huo Mian out of the blue.</p><p>\"I'm about to sleep.\"</p><p>\"This early? I was going to ask you out to dinner.\" Lin Mingyu was a little disappointed.</p><p>\"No, but thank you for your offer.\"</p><p>\"Um… What's your WeChat account? Can I add you?\" Lin Mingyu asked.</p><p>\"I don't really use WeChat,\" Huo Mian politely rejected him once again.</p><p>\"Oh, I see. In that case, I'll call you another time.\"</p><p>After hanging up, Huo Mian realized that she never gave him her phone number.</p><p>He probably got it from the head nurse.</p><p>The hospital was in shambles, she didn't have time for other people right now.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Chu woke up early to make toast and warm milk.</p><p>However, Huo Mian didn't see him when she woke up. She took a few bites and went to work.</p><p>As soon as she arrived at her department, Huang Yue dragged her off to the side. In a hushed tone, she said, \"Mian, the director is back.\"</p><p>\"Isn't the director at an out-of-town conference?\" Huo Mian was confused.</p><p>\"He was, but he came back when he heard what happened at the hospital. I heard that he's meeting the patient's family today. Then, he'll decide on how to handle this.\"</p><p>Huo Mian felt guilty upon hearing this…</p><p>If she hadn't decided to operate on that patient, the hospital and Director Wu wouldn't be in this mess.</p><p>At lunch, when Huo Mian and Huang Yue went to the cafeteria, they once again became the hot topic among the other employees.</p><p>There, she also saw her nemesis – Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>\"Miss Arrogant, I hope you're happy. The entire hospital has erupted because of you. My uncle had to cancel his conference to come back and clean up your mess,\" Wu Xiaoxue snapped; for some reason, every time she saw Huo Mian, she would become agitated.</p><p>\"I'm really sorry about what happened,\" Huo Mian replied calmly.</p><p>\"What's the point in apologizing now?

Don't you even know who you are?\" </p><p>\"Well, this all happened because of an unreliable doctor, who abandoned her shift at night. Did you really think that we wanted to take the risk to save that person's life?\" Huang Yue was young and reckless and wasn't as calm as Huo Mian. It didn't take long for her to start arguing with Wu Xiaoxue. </p><p>The key thing was, Huang Yue was already in a different department now, so she no longer feared to go against Wu Xiaoxue. </p><p>\"What do you mean by 'abandoning work'? I was feeling sick, I'm pregnant, don't you know? As a pregnant woman, I've to take responsibility for my own health and wellbeing. I didn't do anything wrong.

She claims to be not feeling well as soon as she found out she was pregnant. Ditching work is still ditching work, yet she has a so-called excuse, how could she be such an irresponsible doctor?

Why did she even come back to work?\" Huang Yue was extremely pissed off. </p><p>\"Whatever, I don't care what she says, because I've never cared about her.\" </p><p>Huo Mian clearly knew that it was unnecessary to get upset over a person like Wu Xiaoxue every day. </p><p>Huo Mian felt anxious the entire morning. She didn't know how the director was going to handle the situation. </p><p>The truth was, she wouldn't object, even if the director fired her since she truly made a mistake. </p><p>She just didn't want her own misconducts to drag down the hospital. </p><p>She would truly feel terrible if the hospital had to pay a couple million yuan in compensation because of this. </p><p>\"Chief Han, has there been any news? Did the director say anything about what he was going to do?\" Huo Mian kept asking the chief of her department. </p><p>\"How would we know about these things? The director directly contacts the patient.\" </p><p>That afternoon, the head nurse called Huo Mian with the hospital's internal line. </p><p>She simply spoke of what came of this incident, and that the director had met with the patient and her family members.  </p><p>However, they couldn't come to an agreement. The director claimed that the patient's surgery went very well, and she didn't suffer from any infections or side effects. </p><p>It was wrong for Huo Mian, a nurse, to perform the surgery, but that was because she wanted to save the patient's life more than anything. </p><p>In summary, the hospital decided to waive all hospitalization fees the patient incurred during her stay, and compensate the patient thirty thousand yuan for psychological damages.</p><p>To everyone's surprise, the patient's husband was suddenly angered; not only did he yell and scream at the director nonstop, he even flipped the table. </p><p>He said that the hospital won't be able to get rid of them with a mere thirty thousand yuan. They wanted at least three million yuan and not a penny less. </p><p>Finally, the director said, \"Then let's go by legal procedures. You can file a lawsuit against us, and we'll find a specialist to determine whether the patient is truly infected. We'll fight this until the end, from an ethical and a medical perspective. If the court decides that we should pay, then we'll be happy to pay.\" </p><p>In the end, the negotiations ended badly on both sides. </p><p>Finally, the head nurse comforted her, \"The director has already inquired our hospital's legal team, we won't be paying a lot in compensation anyways even if we were forced to. The patient's family members clearly wanted more money than they could get, and we won't back down. Don't worry.\" </p><p>\"Head Nurse, I should resign. Tell the director to fire me, and then let the patient come after me and sue me instead.

Instead, she went to Zhixin's school to look for him.</p><p>It just happened to be noon, and Huo Mian was in the campus cafeteria with Jing Zhixin. They found a less crowded place to sit down. </p><p>\"Sis, don't you have to go to work today?\" Jing Zhixin was quite happy to see his older sister. </p><p>\"We're not so busy lately, so I've been given a few days off.\" </p><p>\"That's great.\" Jing Zhixin never doubted his sister's words. </p><p>Huo Mian felt much better upon seeing her brother's innocent smile. </p><p>\"It's mom's birthday tomorrow, so you can come over earlier. Why don't you come and stay over at home tonight?\" </p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"No, mom wouldn't like it if I went back.\" </p><p>\"That's not true. Mom really misses you, she just won't admit it. She acts like she doesn't care, but she really does. For example, yesterday I told her that you were coming back for her birthday. She didn't say anything, but she looked quite happy.\" </p><p>Huo Mian smiled and didn't respond. </p><p>\"Hey Sis, I have an idea.\" </p><p>\"What's that?\" </p><p>\"I want to rent a spot inside our school with my classmate to sell bubble tea. The bubble tea shop on campus is disgusting and pricey, so students would rather go elsewhere to buy it, but it's very inconvenient. The other shops are far away and going there wastes time. I think that I could sell tasty and inexpensive bubble tea here and earn some money. Then, I'll earn myself next year's tuition. I don't want you to work so hard to pay for my education anymore,\" Jing Zhixin said everything with one breath. </p><p>Huo Mian felt tears welling up inside her... </p><p>\"Zhixin, I'm fine, I'm not short on money right now so don't worry about me. You're still a student; don't open a bubble tea shop. Just focus on studying. I have plans to send you abroad in your senior year.\" </p><p>\"Huh, no thanks, studying abroad is too expensive. You and mom have worked so hard to support me for all these years. I'm a man, and I want to work and provide for our family after graduation. I refuse to burden you guys.\"</p><p>\"You won't, anyway… don't worry about money. I'll take care of it.\" </p><p>\"Mom's birthday is tomorrow, have you decided what you're going to buy her?\" asked Jing Zhixin excitedly. </p><p>\"I haven't, have you?\" </p><p>\"I used the allowance you gave me to pick out a pair of leather shoes for mom. Here, take a look, what do you think? Does it look fashionable enough?\" Jing Zhixin turned on his phone, opened up to some webpage, and showed the shoes to his sister. </p><p>\"Not bad and only 300 yuan. Mom will definitely like them.\" </p><p>\"Yup, I think so too. If you don't know what to buy, just get her a birthday cake,\" Jing Zhixin suggested. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded. \"Okay, I'll figure something out.\" </p><p>Huo Mian received a special call on her way home as she left her brother's school. </p><p>The woman on the other end sounded serious yet graceful, \"Huo Mian, I'm Jiang Hong. Can I meet with you?\" </p><p>Jiang Hong? She was the wife of her cold-hearted birth father and the daughter of C City's Jiang family. </p><p>Huo Siqian's absolutely insane foster mother?</p><p>Huo Mian suddenly felt indecisive…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":157,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:00.33","Link":"Chapter-157","NameDisplay":"Chapter 157"},{"ID":1811209490870961,"Name":"Chapter 158: Clash","NameUnsign":"Chapter 158: Clash","Description":"<p>Chapter 158: Clash</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Don't worry, unlike Shen Jiani, I meant no harm,\" Jiang Hong explained, in fear that Huo Mian would be worried. </p><p>\"Okay, where should we meet?\" </p><p>\"How about this, I'll arrange for a car to pick you up.\" Jiang Hong was very cautious; she didn't say anything about the location but instead arranged for the driver to pick Huo Mian up.</p><p>Huo Mian waited no more than ten minutes when a black Mercedes-Benz slowly parked in front of her. </p><p>Then, the driver drove her to a high-class social club in the urban development zone. </p><p>Huo Mian raised her head and looked over; she had heard about this club, which claimed to be a place where rich ladies gathered. </p><p>Normal people had absolutely no right to enter. Some even said that the club was a subsidiary that belonged to Mrs. Huo, and, from what she saw, it truly seemed to be the case. </p><p>Huo Mian was more cautious than ever because Jiang Hong was Huo Siqian's foster mother. </p><p>In her mind, she always thought that this mother-son duo wasn't easy to deal with. In comparison, they were more of a headache than Shen Jiani and Huo Yanyan, who were only calculative on the surface. </p><p>She got into the elevator, got off at the eighth floor, and spotted Jiang Hong in the room furthest to the back. </p><p>Jiang Hong was over fifty years old but had taken great care of herself. Her skin was wrinkleless, and she wore a deep red cheongsam and a dazzling pink diamond on her finger. </p><p>It was said that Jiang Hong and Huo Zhenghai's marriage was only for business purposes, and Huo Zhenghai was always involved with scandals with other women and was the father of countless illegitimate children. </p><p>However, he never divorced his wife. </p><p>Even so, Shen Jiani was able to enter this family as the second wife, shocking everyone around them.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, you've come. Sit,\" said Jiang Hong gracefully, with a faint smile on her face. </p><p>Huo Mian couldn't tell if she meant well or harm from her smile because this woman was capable of hiding well behind her facade. </p><p>\"Okay.\" Cautiously, Huo Mian slowly sat down. </p><p>\"What would you like to drink?\" asked Jiang Hong. </p><p>\"Just water.\" </p><p>\"You're quite a humble child.\" Jiang Hong smiled and waved her hand. Shortly afterward, the server brought over a glass of water and placed it in front of Huo Mian. </p><p>However, Huo Mian didn't plan on drinking it… </p><p>She ordered water out of respect for Jiang Hong, but that didn't mean she had to drink it. </p><p>All these years, she never allowed herself to drink anything that anyone she didn't trust offered her. It was a form of self-protection. </p><p>Jiang Hong saw through Huo Mian and didn't force her. Instead, she asked, \"I hear that you're a nurse at the First Hospital.\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"Is the job alright for you?\" Jiang Hong continued to ask. </p><p>\"Yes, I like this job.\" </p><p>\"You've never thought about coming back to this family?\" Jiang Hong raised a glass of wine and asked nonchalantly. </p><p>\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Huo Mian replied with determination. </p><p>\"Is that the truth?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"You're special. What's so bad about coming back? You would at least have money, and be much better off than you are now. By then, not only would you be able to be a nurse, you can even be a doctor. We'll find a way.\" </p><p>\"Yes, having money is great. It could satisfy a lot of desires, but money isn't easily earned. I never believed that I had a share in the Huo family's inheritance. Even though my last name is Huo, that doesn't mean anything. Plus, Mr. Huo didn't even admit to who I was back then.\" </p><p>\"Are you mad at him?\" Jiang Hong looked at Huo Mian with a smile and was suddenly interested in the young woman sitting before her. </p><p>No wonder her son always talked about her... </p><p>\"I hated him when I was young,\" replied Huo Mian honestly.</p><p>\"How about now?\" asked Jiang Hong with a smile.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":158,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:00.87","Link":"Chapter-158","NameDisplay":"Chapter 158"},{"ID":18112094914936119,"Name":"Chapter 159: Taking Sides","NameUnsign":"Chapter 159: Taking Sides","Description":"<p>Chapter 159: Taking Sides</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I don't feel anything towards any of you anymore.

For me, I'd rather call my step-father, Mr. Jing, my father.\" </p><p>\"Oh right, I hear he had passed away for a while now, how is your mother?\" </p><p>\"She's very well, thank you for asking.\" Huo Mian spoke very politely but also kept her distance. </p><p>\"Your mother has done very well in educating you. Aside from the plain assemble, you're prettier than Huo Yanyan,\" Jiang Hong commented.</p><p>\"I'm just a normal citizen, I've no right to be compared with a socialite. You're being too kind, ma'am.\" </p><p>Jiang Hong continued looking for mundane topics to discuss with Huo Mian, because she was looking for an opportunity to bring up the real subject. </p><p>However, as they spoke, she noticed that this girl was quite intelligent. Huo Mian responded to every question meticulously, without any flaws.</p><p>This wasn't the kind of maturity and calmness one would see in a twenty-something-year-old. </p><p>Finally, Jiang Hong couldn't hold it in any longer, and she asked, \"Huo Mian, do you know why I've asked you to come here today?\" </p><p>\"I can guess.\" </p><p>\"Oh really? Then let's hear it.\" Huo Mian's remarks seemed to have sparked Jiang Hong's interest. She laid back onto the purple sofa, and looked at Huo Mian, waiting for her answer. </p><p>Today, Huo Mian was no longer wearing her white lab coat. All she wore was a white t-shirt with a black skirt that fell to her knees. </p><p>The black and white assemble was very minimalistic, but looked good on her. Unlike Huo Yanyan, she never wore bedazzling outfits. </p><p>However, she still remained so graceful effortlessly within a crowd and was an unforgettable sight for sore eyes. </p><p>Huo Siqian mentioned Huo Mian several times, leaving quite an impression on Jiang Hong, especially when Huo Zhenghai's mother died.</p><p>Huo Mian hesitated for a moment, and then she slowly said, \"If I've guessed correctly, you came to ask me which side I'm on, right? You want me to come back to help you and Young Master Huo. If I don't agree, then you might think that I'm taking Mrs. Shen's side, subsequently making me your enemy. Thus, you will see my existence as an obstacle.\"</p><p>Jiang Hong stared at Huo Mian for quite a while after she heard her answer. </p><p>It took a while for her to finally respond, \"You really are an interesting girl.\" </p><p>\"Seems like I've guessed your thoughts correctly.\" Huo Mian smiled. </p><p>\"That's right, you're completely right, so whose side are you on? I believe you already know the Huo family's current situation. My son Siqian has already gained control over the majority of the stocks. Over these years, even though Huo Zhenghai hasn't acknowledged you on the surface, the truth is, he is beginning to take you into consideration. In other words...\"</p><p>At this point, Jiang Hong intentionally stopped for a moment… </p><p>Huo Mian continued, \"In other words, the only reason that he wants to acknowledge me as his daughter is because he's afraid that Mrs. Shen's side of the family would be taken advantage of, so he wants to drag me into this mess to help secure more stocks for those two siblings.\" </p><p>\"Yes, that's right.\" Jiang Hong nodded, as she looked at Huo Mian with admiration. </p><p>\"You just told me what you think, do you want to hear what I think?\" asked Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Sure.\" </p><p>\"I never wanted to involve myself in this civil war, so I don't want to pick a side. I haven't had any interactions with either side over these years, so I won't intervene, not with you, nor with Ms. Shen. That's what I think.\"</p><p>\"So, you're saying that you're ready to give up the share of stocks that the Huo family allocates you? Do you have any idea how much money you will be giving up? It's more money than you'll earn in this lifetime. Don't you want to live a life where you're the boss?

Therefore, Jiang Hong stated her position, which was, if they became enemies, then all measures would be taken. </p><p>This was meant to scare Huo Mian, right? </p><p>Even Huo Mian picked up on it… </p><p>\"If you change your mind later on, you're welcome to come and find me anytime,\" Jiang Hong didn't forget to add. </p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded. She then left after saying goodbye.</p><p>She was surprised to see Huo Siqian on the first floor, by the club's entrance. </p><p>He drove an orange Ferrari 488, and a sexy-figured model sat in the passenger seat. </p><p>After the two got off the car, the model coquettishly wrapped herself around Huo Siqian's arm. </p><p>The two of them walked in with laughter and conversation, but from far away, Huo Mian could vividly see Huo Siqian's vulgarity. </p><p>How could he just ignore the waiters there and feel up the pretty model right in front of them?</p><p>\"Whoa, am I seeing clearly? Isn't this my little sister, Mian?\" Huo Siqian's eyes lit up in excitement when he saw Huo Mian. </p><p>\"You've got the wrong person.\" Huo Mian lowered her voice and then headed straight for the door. </p><p>Qin Chu told her that whenever she saw Huo Siqian, she must walk the other way because he was very dangerous. </p><p>Although she hadn't noticed just how dangerous Huo Siqian was, Huo Mian knew that Qin Chu was never wrong. </p><p>He wouldn't say that about someone for no reason; Qin Chu hadn't even told her to avoid Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>This only meant that Qin Chu saw Huo Siqian as an extremely difficult character to deal with. </p><p>\"Mian, did my mom call you over?\" Huo Siqian knew what was happening as soon as he saw Huo Mian at his mother's private club. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't reply, and she had no intention of staying... </p><p>Suddenly, Huo Siqian pushed away the model. He rushed up to the door and arrogantly blocked Huo Mian's way. </p><p>\"What do you want?\" Huo Mian looked at him cautiously. </p><p>Huo Siqian looked up and down at Huo Mian. Then, smiling oddly, he said, \"As always, you're dressed like a country girl, but still likable.\" </p><p>\"Could you say something else when you see me? What are you, a tape recorder?\" said Huo Mian coldly. </p><p>Basically every time Huo Siqian saw Huo Mian, it was either 'little sister, you've gotten prettier', or something along those lines.</p><p>All of his words sounded vulgar. Plus, Huo Mian felt like they were all used to pick up girls, so they shouldn't be used on her.</p><p>Besides, she didn't go for it anyways. She knew how she looked; did she really need him to tell her? </p><p>\"Ha, I like it when you're being difficult, it's so cute!\" Huo Siqian wasn't angered. Huo Mian's response made him laugh. </p><p>\"Mian, since you're here, have a cup of coffee before you leave. I don't get to see you often.\"</p><p>\"No thank you, I'm very busy.\" After she spoke, Huo Mian impolitely shoved away Huo Siqian's arm that blocked her way and walked out in large steps. </p><p>Huo Siqian licked his lips as he watched Huo Mian's petite figure walk away, and his eyes glowed with an odd light. </p><p>\"Young Master Huo, do you have a crush on that woman? You seem to like her,\" the model beside him was getting jealous and coquettishly asked Huo Siqian since she thought Huo Siqian would comfort her. </p><p>To her surprise, Huo Siqian frowned and said, \"Your face and breasts are okay when you don't talk, but as soon as you speak, I have no interest in you anymore. Go away, I'll give you thirty seconds for you to disappear from my sight.\" </p><p>\"Young Master Huo, I'm sorry…\" The model didn't think that the famously well-tempered Huo Siqian would have such an aggressive side. </p><p>\"Go,\" Huo Siqian coldly spat out one word and then turned to head upstairs. </p><p>It was already night time when Huo Mian returned home. She noticed that Qin Chu wasn't home, so she assumed that he was still at work. Then, she suddenly remembered him saying yesterday that he was catching a plane to Taipei tonight. </p><p>At this thought, she suddenly heard the sound of keys opening the door behind her.</p><p>Huo Mian turned around in fear and immediately grew nervous…</p><p>Qin Chu is away on business today, so who else had keys?

Otherwise, it would have hurt his head.</p><p>\"Um…why are you back? I thought you were on a business trip?\" Huo Mian was flabbergasted.</p><p>\"I canceled it for now,\" Qin Chu mumbled. He took a look at Huo Mian's bag. \"What do you carry every day? It's so heavy.\"</p><p>Huo Mian felt awkward. She dry-coughed a couple of times before snatching the bag and hiding it behind her. \"Hm…not much, just some daily necessities.\"</p><p>As for the business trip, all Qin Chu told Huo Mian was that it was canceled on short notice.</p><p>Here was in fact what happened: the trip was only supposed to be three days, but when the company in Taiwan heard that GK's President would appear in person, he added some more locations for Qin Chu to visit to attract GK's investment. </p><p>Then, the trip was extended to six days. Including the time spent on the plane, it was eight days in total.</p><p>Qin Chu thought about it, but not being able to see Huo Mian for eight days? He wasn't happy about it at all.</p><p>It was then that he immediately decided to cancel his trip to Taipei, and instead rearranged to visit the construction of the branch company in a neighboring city the next morning.</p><p>When the Taipei company heard about it, they were anxious, but no matter how hard they tried to convince him, Qin Chu still refused to go.</p><p>GK had previously conducted research into that Taipei company, and the project was potentially huge for GK.</p><p>The board members and high-level executives all felt that it would be a loss if the president didn't go.</p><p>However, no one had the guts to tell him. They were afraid to piss the president off, which was basically setting themselves on fire.</p><p>In the end, it was Assistant Yang who boldly asked, \"President Qin, perhaps we should get someone else to go to Taipei.\" </p><p>\"That sounds good. Tell one of the employees in the marketing department to go.\" With this, Qin Chu sent the director of the marketing department to Taipei.</p><p>He, on the other hand, went home after getting off work at 5 PM but was almost smashed in the head.</p><p>\"Get changed, I want to take you somewhere,\" Qin Chu said.</p><p>\"Where?\" Huo Mian was curious. She hoped that it wasn't a business dinner; she told him that she didn't want to make their relationship public.</p><p>\"We're going to go see Ms. Yao.I hear she's going back to New Zealand.\"</p><p>As soon as she heard that they were going to see Ms. Yao, she immediately got a jacket and followed Qin Chu out the door.</p><p>Ms. Yao lived in an old apartment inside the Second Ring Road District. Back then, that place was allocated to her.</p><p>Her daughter had then brought her to New Zealand to enjoy her retirement. However, she still liked to stay at that place when she came back.</p><p>Qin Chu opened the trunk; he bought a lot of high-quality supplements for her. Huo Mian sometimes thought that Qin Chu was great at paying attention to details like this.</p><p>He took everything into account, even if she didn't.</p><p>Ms. Yao was happy to see the two of them, and the maid even made them dinner.</p><p>The food was simple but delicious, and Qin Chu and Huo Mian stayed to eat with them.</p><p>As they ate, they talked about a lot of things that happened when they were in high school. Finally, Ms. Yao looked at Qin Chu and Huo Mian and said earnestly, \"Remember that it takes a hundred years of cultivation to be able to ride in the same boat, and a thousand years of cultivation to be able to sleep in the same bed. Relationships don't happen easily. Throughout my lifetime, I always believed that the truth behind love is having someone who will pour you a glass of hot water when you're sick and hang up clothes for you after washing them. Even if the couple bickers, they must remember to hug each other afterward. Once romance and lust fade, being there for each other through thick and thin is the best way to express love. Roses and cheesy confessions may be important, but, ultimately, love is a promise; it's swearing to never leave. Once the sun sets on your youth, you'll realize that the great things that happened will all still be there.\"</p><p>Qin Chu and Huo Mian were touched by her words…</p><p>\"Do you know why the divorce rate is so high right now, but not back in my day?\"</p><p>They shook their heads after hearing Ms. Yao's question.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":161,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:03.077","Link":"Chapter-161","NameDisplay":"Chapter 161"},{"ID":1811209493547166,"Name":"Chapter 162: Memory","NameUnsign":"Chapter 162: Memory","Description":"<p>Chapter 162: Memory</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"That's because back then when things broke, we always tried to mend them.

In the end, many died of depression. Divorce rates may be high now, but at least people don't feel stuck anymore.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was speechless.</p><p>So was Ms. Yao…</p><p>Neither of them knew how to respond…</p><p>Finally, it was Huo Mian who snapped back to her senses first. She pinched Qin Chu's thigh under the table, \"Hm, where do you get all this false information from?\"</p><p>\"Aren't I telling the truth?\" Qin Chu rebutted proudly.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately tugged at the corner of his shirt. \"Shut it.\"</p><p>Huo Mian spoke quietly, but Ms. Yao still heard every word.</p><p>Ms. Yao smiled, \"No, it's fine. Qin Chu is right. People were very old-fashioned back then, and some marriages were completely arranged by parents. The marriages may not have gone well, but no one even considered divorce as an option. Back then, divorcees were condemned by their peers, parents wouldn't allow for such things, and gossiping neighbors made things much worse. Today, society has improved, and young people like you have your own modern beliefs. You advocate on living happily because life is bitterly short, and it's better to be happy than otherwise. This is all true. What I want to say is that no matter how times and people change, never forget your original goal – your original aspirations will lead you to success.\"</p><p>Qin Chu was deeply moved by what Ms. Yao said…</p><p>'Your original aspirations will lead you to success'. That's right, Huo Mian was his aspiration.</p><p>He never forgot about it. Seven years ago, Qin Chu was still the same as when he was a young boy.</p><p>Even back then, he was brave enough to stand up to his father, announcing that he wanted to marry Huo Mian.</p><p>Now, seven years later, he married her. To him, Huo Mian was his ultimate treasure.</p><p>After leaving Ms. Yao's home, for some strange reason, neither of them was in a hurry to go home.</p><p>Qin Chu drove them to the gates of Second High School, and the pair got off and walked onto the school field.</p><p>Second High School was still the most prestigious high school in the city, and its students were still at night class.</p><p>There were teachers and supervisors strolling on the field, and bright lights lit up the entire schoolyard.</p><p>It was a beautiful evening, and Qin Chu felt more peaceful than ever.</p><p>\"Nothing's changed here. This place is just as beautiful as I remembered it,\" Huo Mian exclaimed upon seeing the decorative lights by the edge of the basketball field.</p><p>\"Have you been back since graduation?\" Qin Chu asked.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head. \"Only when you took me to Ah-Xin's Ramen shop.\"</p><p>Qin Chu scanned the school, his eyes deep and misty. He sighed and said, \"When I was in the United States, I kept dreaming about this place. I still remember every tree and every corner.\"</p><p>\"You were basically a legend at Second High.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"That's all in the past.\"</p><p>\"Those days may be behind you, but the legend continues. Those girls never stopped falling crazily in love with you.\" Huo Mian chuckled.</p><p>Back then, she had witnessed girls professing their love for Qin Chu with the cheesiest banners they made and the lamest slogans they came up with.</p><p>Something like 'Qin Chu, we love you. We won't falter even if trees falter, and we won't move even if China moves.'</p><p>When Huo Mian saw those banners, she was speechless from inside out. She could bet on her life that Qin Chu would never fall in love with those girls.</p><p>\"What about you?

He even had his own table during mealtimes.</p><p>This, of course, was because GK donated a huge sum to the school, so Qin Chu received special treatment.</p><p>He existed like a god, and even the principal had to treat him with respect.</p><p>And that was until Huo Mian appeared in his life…</p><p>Huo Mian didn't pay attention to any of the unspoken rules. She was a ditzy girl who accidentally kicked a soccer ball right into Qin Chu's face.</p><p>The pretty boy was almost disfigured…</p><p>During lunchtime, Huo Mian accidentally slipped on her feet and spilled an entire bowl of vegetable soup right onto Qin Chu.</p><p>Most importantly, Qin Chu never got mad at her.</p><p>Some of the super jealous girls secretly gossiped that Huo Mian was doing it on purpose and was playing push and pull with him to spark his interest.</p><p>They all thought that she wanted GK's prince, but no one knew how fearless Huo Mian was back then.</p><p>She didn't care about Qin Chu. Even if it was someone more powerful, she would still ignore them.</p><p>She had a lot of attitudes and would even fight against little punks when outnumbered 1 to 4.</p><p>She was so fearless that she would beat up the big boys from another class just to protect her class's reputation.</p><p>She also had the ability to ditch school and not study, but still get the highest grades in their year.</p><p>She was arrogant enough to disregard anyone, even if that person was the prince of GK.</p><p>\"Ahem, don't include me. I treated you like a passerby. I wasn't your fan back then.\" Huo Mian dry-coughed.</p><p>\"Do you know what I was thinking about when I first met you?\" Happy memories flooded through Qin Chu as he smiled and asked Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled, \"You must be thinking, 'how did this little brat get in?'\"</p><p>Huo Mian was only 14 years old when she began attending 2nd High School, making her the youngest in their year.</p><p>The age restriction there was 17 simply because schoolwork was too hard, and the school was afraid that younger kids wouldn't be able to keep up.</p><p>However, Huo Mian was different. She got a perfect mark on her middle school examination, so Second High made an exception and offered her admission.</p><p>Back then during an interview, Huo Mian also said something preposterous.</p><p>A reporter tried to provoke her by saying, \"So what if you have got a perfect grade? I got 90% on some of the tests for my middle school examination as well. Truth be told, there's not much of a difference between 90% and 100%.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's reply was audacious and shocking.</p><p>She said, \"I got 100% because there are only so many points on the test. However, you got 90% because that's all you can get. You can't compare yourself to me.\"</p><p>The reporter was flabbergasted at Huo Mian's reply.</p><p>Qin Chu was deeply attracted by her when he saw this interview…</p><p>He raised his hand and placed it on Huo Mian's shoulder. Enunciating each word, he said, \"When I first saw you on TV, I thought, 'I'm going to make this girl my wife for sure'.\"</p><p>Huo Mian didn't expect that Qin Chu would say that, and her entire face turned bright red.</p><p>As Huo Mian was spacing out, Qin Chu gracefully lowered his head and kissed her…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":163,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:03.99","Link":"Chapter-163","NameDisplay":"Chapter 163"},{"ID":18112094944533339,"Name":"Chapter 164: Boundary","NameUnsign":"Chapter 164: Boundary","Description":"<p>Chapter 164: Boundary</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian had a high IQ and a high EQ, but she had one flaw.</p><p>When she was with Qin Chu, she would sometimes lose the ability to think. This was also why Qin Chu successfully got her to become his girlfriend back then.</p><p>She always thought that everything that happened was destiny. No matter how rational and perfect she was, she easily fell apart in front of Qin Chu.</p><p>Therefore, when Qin Chu kissed her, she wanted to resist, but she couldn't summon any strength. Or maybe, her body was just being honest about not wanting to push him away and wanted him and his unique scent to be forever hers.</p><p>When the students were on break, the school often broadcasted songs to help them relieve stress.</p><p>As if it was right on cue, music flowed onto the field…</p><p>\"Going back to the starting point again, seeing that innocent face of yours in my memory. It's hard to believe that today is finally the day.</p><p>The old photo hidden under the table, linking countless memories together.

Hugging you tightly…\"</p><p>Hu Xia's Those Years was playing at the perfect moment, fitting the atmosphere between the two extremely well.</p><p>Huo Mian was a woman with complex emotions, and, at that moment, she was extremely moved.</p><p>She thought back at her and Qin Chu all those years ago and couldn't help but wrap her arms around his broad shoulders, hugging him tightly.</p><p>They've already missed out on seven years... how many more 'seven years' were left in their lives?</p><p>Qin Chu's heart filled with butterflies. Since they reunited, this was the first time Huo Mian hugged him.</p><p>That gentle kiss lasted for 3 minutes and 50 seconds, the same length as that song.</p><p>Finally, Qin Chu held Huo Mian's hand in his as they walked out of the campus in silence. Neither of them talked again until they got home.</p><p>Once they were home, Huo Mian felt a little sleepy, so she took a hot shower in her bedroom.</p><p>However, as soon as she left the bathroom, Qin Chu basically pounced on her, pushing her down onto the bed.</p><p>\"Qin Chu…\" Huo Mian was a little nervous.</p><p>\"Mian, I don't want to wait anymore…\"</p><p>Then, Qin Chu tugged at Huo Mian's bathrobe until it fell off, his warm palm tightening around her pale shoulders.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, I don't…\"</p><p>Qin Chu's tongue invaded her mouth before she could finish her sentence.</p><p>This kiss was no longer gentle like the one they shared at school.</p><p>It was an aggressive invasion, leaving her no room to think.</p><p>Huo Mian's mind went blurry and heavy; she couldn't think about anything else.</p><p>Qin Chu seemed to have control over everything…</p><p>They've been married for a while now but didn't do much else except kissing.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Chu wanted to because he had always been clear about his feelings towards Huo Mian.</p><p>However, Huo Mian was struggling to admit her own feelings, because she didn't think that she would be able to spend the rest of her life with him.</p><p>She was still thinking about divorce and didn't want to give him too much hope.</p><p>Huo Mian believed that if a woman gave both her heart and body to a man, she would lose for sure.</p><p>She needed an escape route, so she always tried to keep that line drawn between them.</p><p>Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian through the small ray of moonlight that shone through the crack between the curtains.

She picked up her phone and walked towards the door.</p><p>Qin Chu's expression was horrible…</p><p>\"Hey, Lingling.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong? You sound weird.\"</p><p>\"No I don't.\" Huo Mian was feeling a bit guilty.</p><p>\"I don't believe you. I've known you for so long, don't try to trick me. Oh wait, were you and Qin Chu doing stuff that is inappropriate for young children to see?\" Zhu Lingling snickered.</p><p>\"You seem to be over your break up, I'm assuming that you're not killing yourself over it anymore?\" Huo Mian didn't know what else to say.</p><p>\"Of course, who do you think I am? I am the invincible and pretty Zhu Lingling. I just flew back into the city and have two days off. Let's hang out tomorrow and go on a road trip. I want to go to a farm outside the city to fish and then go on an excursion, what do you think?\"</p><p>\"Tomorrow? I can't tomorrow, it's my mom's birthday. How about the day after tomorrow? I will probably be free then.\"</p><p>\"Oh right, I forgot that it's Auntie's birthday tomorrow. Okay then, let's make plans for the day after tomorrow.\"</p><p>After hanging up, Huo Mian returned to her room, embarrassed.</p><p>Qin Chu leaned on her bed, smoking a cigarette.</p><p>\"Um… Lingling asked if I wanted to go on an excursion with her, haha,\" Huo Mian explained.</p><p>\"Tell Zhu Lingling to get her ass over here. I promise I won't beat her to death,\" Qin Chu growled angrily.</p><p>\"Um… ahem, um, it's late, goodnight.\"</p><p>\"Are you kicking me out?\" Qin Chu asked, glancing at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Isn't this supposed to be my room?\" Huo Mian asked helplessly.</p><p>\"Aren't you supposed to be my wife?\" Qin Chu asked back.</p><p>Huo Mian was speechless…</p><p>\"So you don't plan on leaving?\"</p><p>\"You need to compensate for what happened just now. Tonight, we're sleeping on the same bed. Of course, if you think your bed isn't big enough, we can sleep in my room instead,\" Qin Chu tapped the ash off his cigarette and said presumptuously.</p><p>Huo Mian was furious, but she couldn't find a reason to say no.</p><p>The truth was, she understood his frustration. If it weren't for Zhu Lingling's phone call, Qin Chu would have gotten his way with her.</p><p>He was so close to tasting her; she should be glad that he wasn't going crazy…</p><p>Finally, Huo Mian decided to compromise. She simply answered, \"Deal.\"</p><p>Then began the days where Qin Chu dominated Huo Mian's bed…</p><p>This was her first time sleeping in the same bed with Qin Chu. It felt weird, sleeping in his embrace.</p><p>This time was different from the last, because, last time, he snuck in during the middle of the night.</p><p>This time, they laid face to face.</p><p>Although seven years ago, they already enjoyed the sweet taste of making love, they were so young back then and had too much to drink that night. Neither of them could remember exactly what happened that night.</p><p>Embarrassed to look at Qin Chu, Huo Mian ended up turning her back towards him.</p><p>Qin Chu took that opportunity to hug her waist from behind, pulling her into his body.</p><p>This made Huo Mian more nervous than ever.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, I'm telling you. Don't touch me where you're not supposed to, I'm ticklish,\" Huo Mian warned him.</p><p>\"Don't worry, I won't, because I'll end up suffer more than you.\"</p><p>After quietly sleeping next to each other the entire night, the next day after breakfast, Qin Chu went to work, and Huo Mian went to the mall.</p><p>She spent a thousand yuan on a dress for her mother and ordered a cake. Then, she took the cab to her mom's.</p><p>As soon as she arrived, she smelled the delicious aroma of food. Her mother's yard was filled with close neighbors.</p><p>\"Mian, you're back!\" The neighbors all greeted her.</p><p>Yang Meirong turned around at the mention of Huo Mian's name.

To where?\" their neighbor, Auntie Wu, asked enthusiastically.</p><p>Huo Mian answered with a smile, \"To the hospital laboratory, all I do is draw and run tests on blood.\"</p><p>\"That's good, it's much easier. I told your mom to tell you not to work at the OB/GYN department, it's too much responsibility. The pregnant ladies there are such prissy pants.

It's good that you were transferred.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, it's relatively easier, and I don't have to work night shifts anymore.\"</p><p>\"Hey, Mian, why didn't your boyfriend come with you?\"</p><p>The neighbors were really gossipy; some of her mother's friends were nosy and couldn't help themselves from asking.</p><p>\"We broke up.\" </p><p>\"What, you guys broke up? I thought you were getting married? Why did you break up?\" To no one's surprise, the middle-aged women all became interested at the sight of gossip.</p><p>Huo Mian felt awkward and didn't know what to say.</p><p>Then, she saw Zhixin walk out into the yard. He took the cake in Huo Mian's hand and said, \"Young people nowadays usually break up because of incompatible personalities.\"</p><p>\"Isn't he a doctor? That's a good profession.\"</p><p>They all thought that it was a shame Huo Mian broke up with Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p>\"How is it good? He's still an intern and might not even be given a permanent position at the hospital. Plus, that dude's personality was not compatible with my sister's at all. When they were talking about marriage, he mishandled so many details. The two of them decided to end their relationship peacefully.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I see. So that's what happened,\" Zhixin answered well for his sister, and the middle-aged women finally stopped pestering for more details…</p><p>After a while, Yang Meirong served the food.</p><p>There were eight dishes, and the cake that Huo Mian ordered earlier was placed in the middle.</p><p>In addition to Yang Meirong, Huo Mian, and Jing Zhixin, there were three other middle-aged women, of which Auntie Wu was closest to Yang Meirong.</p><p>As for the other two, Huo Mian didn't really like them.</p><p>Not because they weren't rich; rather, it was because they were typical narrow-minded cheapskates.</p><p>They liked taking advantage of others, gossiping about other families and were complete wallflowers. They looked down on people with no money.</p><p>Auntie Wu's son was thirty years old and single, and she herself was kind of well off. She owned two properties, and a storefront in the city and her son worked at a bank. He went on blind dates dozens of times, but they were all unsuccessful. Most of the time, it was because they thought that the woman's family background wasn't good enough for them. </p><p>\"Mom, happy birthday.\" Huo Mian took out the dress she bought for her mother.</p><p>After seeing the brand, Auntie Wang asked, \"My gosh, isn't this from Girdear? That's not a cheap brand. How much did you spend, Mian?\"</p><p>\"Not much.\"</p><p>\"How much is not much?\" Auntie Wang probed.</p><p>\"A little over twelve hundred yuan.\"</p><p>\"Twelve hundred is a lot, you only earn two thousand a month, right? Tsk tsk, I can't believe you would buy a dress so expensive.\"</p><p>Aunties Wang's words reeked of disdain.</p><p>Yang Meirong looked at the dress and casually said, \"That's why daughters are better. She earns two grand a month but is willing to spend twelve hundred to buy me a dress. Too bad someone's son earns more than ten thousand yuan every month but still has yet to buy his mother anything.\"</p><p>Auntie Wang was embarrassed by this and immediately shut up.</p><p>Apparently, a while back on her birthday, her son didn't even call her. He probably forgot about it. Her son had graduated from a university in Singapore and worked at a foreign-owned enterprise, so he earned more than fifteen thousand yuan a month. </p><p>\"Not bad, my friend. You've got a great son and daughter. Zhixin's still in school but managed to save up enough money to buy you a pair of shoes. You didn't raise them up for nothing.\"</p><p>At that moment, the other middle-aged woman, Auntie Liu, said with her big mouth, \"It would be better if Jing was here, you'll have a whole and happy family. It's too bad that…\"</p><p>Upon hearing Uncle Jing's name, Huo Mian's eyes turned red, and she felt her throat clog up.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":166,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:05.45","Link":"Chapter-166","NameDisplay":"Chapter 166"},{"ID":18112094959573307,"Name":"Chapter 167: A Heart-to-Heart","NameUnsign":"Chapter 167: A Heart-to-Heart","Description":"<p>Chapter 167: A Heart-to-Heart</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian thought those sad memories would cause her mother to treat her with indifference again.</p><p>However, to her pleasant surprise, Yang Meirong just pursed her lips and said, \"He's been dead for so long, why bring him up?

They're super gossipy like that.\"</p><p>\"I know, already forgotten.\"</p><p>\"That's good. You don't seem to be too busy these days, right?\" Jing Zhixin asked his sister.</p><p>\"Yeah, the hospital gave me three days off so I don't have much to do.\"</p><p>\"That's good! If you don't have to go to work today, sleep here tonight. You haven't stayed overnight in a while.\" Jing Zhixin looked at her with puppy eyes. He adored his sister; when they were young, he and his sister often played hide-and-seek under the old tree in the yard. When they were tired, he would fall asleep under that tree, and Huo Mian would recite Grimm's Fairy Tales to him.</p><p>His sister was a genius; Grimm's Fairy Tale is a very thick book, and back then, Zhixin couldn't even recognize all the words, but Huo Mian recited it like it was her own.</p><p>He was always so proud of his sister.</p><p>Even after his birth father, Jing De, died because of his sister, he never blamed her, not one bit.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other side, always thought that his brother was a warm and outgoing boy. He was carefree and innocent, and she wanted to protect him.</p><p>Especially after Uncle Jing's death, she couldn't bear to let anything happen to Zhixin.</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian thought about Zhixin's request and nodded her head in agreement.</p><p>\"Yay, awesome!\" Zhixin was overjoyed.</p><p>After dinner, the other women left, and Huo Mian helped her mother clean up the plates and cutlery.</p><p>As she was washing the dishes, she quietly mumbled, \"Mom, Jiang Hong came looking for me a couple of days ago, and she asked me if I wanted to go back.\"</p><p>\"Nothing good comes from her contacting you.\"</p><p>\"It was about the Huo family's civil war – the wife and mistress are butting heads.\"</p><p>\"That's good, I hope they fight to the death.

She had a bright future in front of her and never thought that bastard would ruin her entire life.</p><p>In the end, he wouldn't even acknowledge his own child and gave that sly vixen Shen Jiani an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>\"I won't go back, I'm not interested in their inheritance or anyone in that family.\" Huo Mian told her mother how she felt.</p><p>Yang Meirong stopped what she was doing; she turned around to look at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"It's rare for you to think that way.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to go through the pain that you went through. I don't care about money; more money, more problems. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you and Zhixin peacefully. Once Zhixin gets married, I'll take you down south. We'll have a chance to go see our country's beautiful mountains and rivers.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's words touched Yang Meirong's heart…</p><p>Since the death of Jing De, she always blamed Huo Mian for everything that happened.

Keep on a lookout and find a good man to spend your life with.

The death of your Uncle Jing was his fate; even if he didn't pass away to save you, he probably would still have met with some other disaster.\"</p><p>\"Mom…\" Huo Mian was surprised to hear her mother speak of these words.</p><p>Moreover, she actually understood it… the knot between them seemed to loosen up quite a bit.</p><p>At least her mother no longer blamed and hated her for Uncle Jing's death.

It's her birthday today so I won't be going home. I'm staying the night.\"</p><p>\"Oh.\" Qin Chu showed his acknowledgement with one simple word.</p><p>He was going to take her to the new seafood restaurant in the northern end of the city, but sadly didn't see her when he arrived at home.</p><p>Upon hearing that Huo Mian wasn't coming home, Qin Chu didn't have anything else to do. Therefore, he drove back to the company.</p><p>Assistant Yang was getting ready to go home when he saw the president come back to the office. He was instantly alert.</p><p>\"President Qin, is something wrong?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm just going to work for a while.\"</p><p>Assistant Yang pulled a long face; he told his wife that he would go to the movies with her and just now, she had informed him that she bought the tickets.

Was he supposed to take the bus to work?</p><p>That's not the problem here. The problem was that, for some reason, he had the honor of being driven by his boss, the president of GK.</p><p>Of course, what he didn't know was that Qin Chu was only driving him because his wife was at her mother's, and he was extremely bored.</p><p>Plus, driving his assistant meant that he'll be able to see a movie as well.</p><p>Once they arrived at the movie theatre, Yang's wife's face lit up with surprise when she saw another man with her husband.</p><p>She quietly asked her husband, \"Who is this?\"</p><p>\"My boss.\"</p><p>\"Pre… President Qin?\" Yang's wife was shocked as well.</p><p>He nodded his head…</p><p>\"President Qin, ha, we're here.

Tickets for that movie had sold out; it was full.</p><p>\"President Qin, ha, why don't you watch something else?

He knew that President Qin wasn't going to hit on his wife, but the point was, his wife might be tempted to hit on President Qin.</p><p>Finally, Yang bit on his tongue and came to a compromise with his wife.</p><p>He and his boss would go and watch Finding Mr. Right 2, while his wife was to suck it up and watch Captain America with tears in her eyes.</p><p>She was a head-to-toe Chinese housewife who had no interest in American superhero films, but there was nothing more she could do.</p><p>Neither of them was brave enough to piss President Qin off.</p><p>After the movie, Qin Chu was so happy that he offered to drive the couple home.</p><p>In addition, he gave a greeting present to Yang's newborn.</p><p>It was a red packet containing ten thousand yuan.</p><p>Yang's wife was elated at the sight of the red packet and completely forgot about the movie ticket fiasco just now.</p><p>She kept exclaiming, \"Your boss is really nice, he's so generous.\"</p><p>Yang rolled his eyes at his wife and said, \"Weren't you the one who called him a third wheel behind his back just now and was pissed off at him for stealing your movie ticket? I can't believe you've changed your stance already.

Therefore, as soon as he drove home, he searched up Finding Mr. Right 1 on his computer and watched that.</p><p>He enjoyed that one as well. Suddenly, he wondered if he should take Huo Mian to watch Finding Mr. Right 2 again tomorrow once she was back.</p><p>As he was thinking, a local news alert popped onto his computer screen, grabbing his attention.</p><p>\"Breaking news. The First Hospital has involved itself in a doctor-patient scandal. According to our sources, a pregnant patient was sent to the emergency room in the middle of the night, but the on-call doctor wasn't there. As an experiment, a nurse performed surgery on that patient, who afterward experienced postoperative complications. The pregnant patient and her newborn are now suffering from severe side effects, and the hospital ignored her family's complaints. The hospital protected the nurse and tried to shut the entire thing down, so the patient had no choice but to sue the hospital. The patient's family was extremely emotional and caused a scene at the First Hospital today. The hospital sent security to control the scene, but chaos erupted instead, and, as a result, many patients were unable to see doctors. The nurse-in-question did not show herself, and the director, Wu Zhongxing, has yet to comment on the situation. According to speculation, this is the first time in 15 years that the hospital was burdened with a scandal. Everyone's attention is on this incident; stay tuned, we will shortly provide a follow-up report.\"</p><p>Qin Chu frowned as he shut off his computer. Huo Mian was in trouble…</p><p>As soon as news outlets exposed something like this, more often than not, the situation would become uncontrollable and unpredictable.</p><p>He immediately picked up his phone and dialed a number, \"Stop the media from reporting about the incident at the First Hospital in 30 minutes. Don't even let one station follow-up on it.\"</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, was sound asleep, completely unaware that her world was about to flip upside down.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":169,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:06.98","Link":"Chapter-169","NameDisplay":"Chapter 169"},{"ID":18112094974194147,"Name":"Chapter 170: Conflict","NameUnsign":"Chapter 170: Conflict","Description":"<p>Chapter 170: Conflict</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>After Qin Chu exerted pressure on the media, attention on the incident seemed to die down.</p><p>However, someone somehow created an account on the local First Forum and exposed the scandal in a post.</p><p>This was the information era.

As soon as the scandal was posted, people immediately began to like, comment, and repost. In the end, the scandal still blew up.</p><p>The person who posted it claimed to be the family of the patient and stated that the First Hospital was corrupt because it asked a nurse to pretend to be a doctor, just so the hospital could dupe the patient's family out of money.</p><p>Moreover, it pointed out that the TV stations, which were originally supposed to report this incident, stopped doing so because the hospital went through its connections and forced them to stop.</p><p>The manipulation here was clearly obvious…</p><p>What they didn't know was that the First Hospital didn't do anything to stop news outlets from reporting Huo Mian's scandal.</p><p>Rather, it was her husband, Qin Chu.

Not only did it allow a nurse to operate on a pregnant patient, the black hands behind the scenes pressured the media into ignoring it, causing commoners to have nowhere to complain.\"</p><p>A post like this immediately caught the attention of all walks of life, including the Municipal Bureau and other administrative offices.</p><p>Even the Ministry of Health called Director Wu Zhongxing of the First Hospital again and again, in an attempt to demand what happened.</p><p>Huo Mian had just enjoyed a night at home, but when she woke up, she realized that the whole world had changed.</p><p>When she goes to bed, she had the habit of turning her phone to silent so it wouldn't affect her sleep quality.</p><p>Therefore, when she picked up her phone in the morning, she thought that her phone's system had crashed.</p><p>There were more than a hundred missed calls, not to mention countless texts and WeChat messages.</p><p>\"Mian, something bad happened, where are you? Why aren't you picking up?\" Huang Yue sent.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, call me back, it's an emergency,\" the head nurse sent.</p><p>\"Girl, did you see the news? I think it was talking about your hospital, and I even heard them mention your name. What happened?\" Zhu Lingling messaged.</p><p>Huo Mian flipped through her phone to realize that Qin Chu had called her a couple of times as well.</p><p>Something really bad must have happened, why else would everyone be frantically looking for her?</p><p>\"Sis, you're up,\" Zhixin walked in with a glass of warm milk, which he placed in Huo Mian's hand.</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"There's something that I want to tell you, but I'm not sure if I should.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Huo Mian frowned when she heard the hesitation in her brother's voice.</p><p>Zhixin thought about it, then he passed his phone to Huo Mian, and showed her his WeChat friend circle.</p><p>It turns out that news traveled really fast, and the forum post had already been reposted on people's WeChat friend circles (TL: Friend circles are like Facebook's home feed, you get to see your friends' statuses and shared pictures).</p><p>Someone even vowed to conduct a thorough internet search on Huo Mian.</p><p>A few of Jing Zhixin's friends knew that Huo Mian was his sister, so they sent him the link to the post early this morning.</p><p>He was in a bad mood after reading it but was also afraid that it would make his sister sad.</p><p>However, he knew that he wouldn't be able to hide it. His sister would find out sooner or later.</p><p>After calmly reading it, Huo Mian returned the phone to her brother.</p><p>\"Sis, what happened? I don't believe that you would do something like this. Someone set you up, didn't they?\"</p><p>Truth be told, after Huo Mian found out what happened, she wasn't surprised. The patient's husband had already declared that he was going to fight Huo Mian to the grave.</p><p>Therefore, being exposed wasn't surprising; what surprised her was the fact that media outlets hadn't reported anything. Instead, this post blew up on WeChat.</p><p>\"Don't worry, it'll be okay. I'll deal with it,\" Huo Mian said as she left the room to wash up like everything was fine.</p><p>She left after saying goodbye to her mother and brother.</p><p>When Huo Mian arrived at the First Hospital, she saw from afar all the people standing there, clogging up the hospital's entrance.</p><p>There were even giant banners that said, \"Heartless hospital, heartless nurse.

I never thought that it would become so serious. It's all over my WeChat friend circle, and a lot of friends were asking me about it.

Right now I need to find the head nurse.\"</p><p>\"I'll go with you. Let's go in from the side, not the front.\"</p><p>\"Mhm.\"</p><p>After speaking, Huo Mian and Huang Yue prepared to go around to the back door. Just then, somebody yelled.</p><p>\"Look, the nurse is there.\"</p><p>Suddenly, a swarm of people surrounded them. Most of them were with the patient, but some of them were reporters from small newspapers.</p><p>The regular media didn't dare to report the incident, but it was inevitable that some people would expose others for their own benefits.</p><p>\"You are Huo Mian, right? As one of the parties involved, what do you have to say?\"</p><p>\"They're twisting the truth, the truth is not what they say it is. The pregnant woman did not experience any side effects. The family members are causing a scene because they want to extort a high settlement. They're purposefully defaming our hospital,\" Huo Mian calmly explained.</p><p>At that moment, the husband of the patient pointed at Huo Mian with a ferocious face and cursed, \"Don't sling dirt at us, we didn't defame you! I am telling the truth. You are a black-hearted nurse who obviously doesn't have a doctor's certificate, but you still pretended to be a doctor and operated on my wife. Now, both my daughter and my wife are suffering from post-op complications. Not only did your hospital fail to provide a statement, you are also deliberately pushing away responsibility. The most infuriating thing is that yesterday, Urban Daily clearly promised to interview us and expose the hospital, but the hospital found someone to cover it up. This is too unjust, how do you expect citizens to live like this? Come on everyone, how is this fair?!\"</p><p>The man's explanation sounded home-prepared, but spoken at that moment and paired with his livid emotions, many people believed him.</p><p>Huang Yue's face turned red from anger as she replied, \"You liar, you're wrong. You tried blackmailing our hospital director for millions, and you slung dirt at him when he refused to pay you. You'll get karma for what you are doing.\"</p><p>\"Then, Miss. Huo Mian, can you tell me if you're a nurse from this hospital?\" A reporter stepped up, utilizing this opportunity to probe further.</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>\"You're a nurse in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, right?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>\"Did you actually operate on that pregnant patient? There were no doctors present, correct?\"</p><p>Huo Mian hesitated, knowing the reporter had asked a crucial question. Her answer would be considered an admission to everything.</p><p>At that point, she may push the issue past its breaking point. But, if she said no, she would be lying.</p><p>Huang Yue nervously squeezed Huo Mian as if she wanted her to correct herself and deny it. Since there were too many people there, it would cause problems in the future.</p><p>However, Huo Mian felt it was wrong to lie.</p><p>\"Yes, that is correct.\"</p><p>After Huo Mian personally admitted to it, the crowd went wild...</p><p>Everyone began blaming her; they cursed, \"You black-hearted nurse, how could you conduct an experiment on a pregnant woman and her child like this? Aren't you afraid of karma?\"</p><p>Huang Yue was about to cry from the tension. She loudly explained, \"Mian did it to save her, listen to me, the situation that night was extremely urgent…\"</p><p>However, Huang Yue's voice was not loud enough, and it was soon covered by the voice of others. No one was listening to her explanation.</p><p>\"Everyone look, this woman admitted it. This evil woman almost killed my wife, I'm not backing down today!\" When he finished speaking, he charged and threw himself at Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian dodged and the man fell short.</p><p>Huo Mian grabbed ahold of Huang Yue's shoulder and said, \"You should go, I'll think of a way.\"</p><p>Then, she abruptly shoved Huang Yue, pushing her away from the clog of people...</p><p>At that moment, the pregnant patient's husband pushed through the crowd, and, while Huo Mian wasn't paying attention, he shoved her onto the ground.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":171,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:08.983","Link":"Chapter-171","NameDisplay":"Chapter 171"},{"ID":18112094995455684,"Name":"Chapter 172: Wrath","NameUnsign":"Chapter 172: Wrath","Description":"<p>Chapter 172: Wrath</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Gasps and screams rippled through the crowd and Huo Mian felt something hit her head that left her in pain.</p><p>Hospital security rushed out and began brawling with the patient's family.</p><p>The patient's family seemed to be emotionally agitated and only wanted to beat Huo Mian up.</p><p>The sudden riot deprived all order of the situation.

He coldly looked at the man on the ground.</p><p>\"Wait for it, I am going to sue you for assault…\" the man said while gritting his teeth.</p><p>\"Very well, I'll wait for your lawsuit.\" When he finished speaking, Qin Chu spun around.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, let's go.\"</p><p>Qin Chu didn't speak, but he suddenly picked Huo Mian up bridal-style and carried her out.</p><p>\"Hey, how could you leave with her without signing?\" Gao Ran yelled after them.</p><p>Qin Chu ignored him; he put Huo Mian in the passenger seat, buckled her seat belt, and sped off.</p><p>\"You're screwed,\" looking at the man on the ground, Gao Ran said sympathetically.</p><p>He really wanted to ask him why, out of all the people in this world, would he mess with Qin Chu?</p><p>More importantly, why would he mess with Qin Chu's wife?</p><p>Qin Chu was very dedicated to his wife...</p><p>\"I can't believe that policemen beated me up. I am going to sue you all,\" the man wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth and viciously said.</p><p>\"That wasn't a cop, please have some common sense, okay? That's the victim's family.\"</p><p>\"So why didn't you stop him when he was beating me? How could you let him intrude in like this? I can't even have my safety assured at the police station. This is police negligence. I am going to file a complaint.\"</p><p>Looking at the man, still arrogant after a beating, Gao Ran hopelessly said, \"People like you, with an IQ like a potato, will have no chance of surviving even half an episode of a TV show.\"</p><p>On the road, Qin Chu did not say a single word. He made no reactions, no matter what Huo Mian said.</p><p>He maintained a stern expression and looked straight ahead, ignoring Huo Mian's presence.</p><p>Huo Mian knew for sure that he must be angry...</p><p>However, she also wondered why he was angry.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, what… what do you want to eat for lunch?\"</p><p>Qin Chu remained silent...</p><p>\"Qin Chu, don't you have to work today? How about you park up there? I can go back to the hospital myself, and you can go back to the company.\"</p><p>Qin Chu was still silent...</p><p>\"Qin Chu…\" Huo Mian still wanted to say something.</p><p>However, she saw Qin Chu turn his head. The look he gave her looked like he was going to eat her.</p><p>She swallowed the second half of her sentence and didn't dare to speak another word.</p><p>In the parking lot below their building, Qin Chu parked the car, looked straight ahead, and demanded in a cold voice, \"Why is it that every time you get into trouble, I am never the first one you think of?\"</p><p>Huo Mian was rendered speechless upon hearing his question.</p><p>\"Am I that unimportant to you? No matter how much trouble you're in, you never tell me about it. Do my feelings matter that little to you?\"</p><p>Qin Chu asked, his heart bleeding with every word.</p><p>Huo Mian was injured, Huo Mian was wronged, Huo Mian's video was exposed, and Huo Mian was taken to the police station.</p><p>She never mentioned anything to him, not even a single word.</p><p>Qin Chu suddenly felt like since they got married, everything was just his wishful thinking...</p><p>After listening to Qin Chu, Huo Mian's facial expression changed drastically...</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":174,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:10.527","Link":"Chapter-174","NameDisplay":"Chapter 174"},{"ID":18112094911951192,"Name":"Chapter 175: Suspicion","NameUnsign":"Chapter 175: Suspicion","Description":"<p>Chapter 175: Suspicion</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"No Qin Chu, that's not it. I just… didn't want you to worry about me.\"</p><p>\"You might as well just say that I'll always be an outsider in your eyes.\" </p><p>\"No, that's not it…\" </p><p>Finally, the two of them sat in the car in silence for quite a while, with no one saying anything. </p><p>Qin Chu didn't speak because he was angry, and Huo Mian didn't speak because she didn't know what to say. </p><p>Huo Mian felt hints of pain on her head. After she reached over to touch it, she frowned. </p><p>\"Ouch...\" Huo Mian couldn't help but to make a sound because of the pain. </p><p>In that moment, Qin Chu's heart immediately softened... </p><p>After he got out of the car, he held onto Huo Mian's hand as they walked upstairs. </p><p>Then, he took out the first-aid kit to disinfect Huo Mian's wound. </p><p>He gently moved Huo Mian's long hair to the side and saw a purple bump on the left side of her head. It seemed to be a bruise. </p><p>Qin Chu felt terrible… </p><p>\"Hold on for a bit, I'm going to disinfect the area with an antiseptic wipe first.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>After Qin Chu disinfected the area with a cotton swab dipped in isopropanol, he wrapped a boiled egg and pressed it onto her head. </p><p>\"I'll be fine on my own, you should go to work.\" </p><p>\"I have my priorities and don't need you to remind me,\" Qin Chu said not-very-nicely. </p><p>Huo Mian immediately fell silent… </p><p>It was as if Qin Chu had eaten gunpowder today. He was terrifying, especially when he was beating up the man at the police station a while ago. </p><p>She even thought that if Gao Ran hadn't pulled him back, he would have beaten that man to death. </p><p>Qin Chu took out his phone and called Assistant Yang. He told Yang that he wouldn't be going back to the office in the afternoon and ordered him to push everything back. </p><p>Then he took out his laptop and sat with Huo Mian on the living room sofa, as he looked for news that came out from the discussion threads on the forum. </p><p>\"There must be someone behind it for things to get this bad. However, I don't think that that patient's family members are capable of doing something like this,\" explained Qin Chu as he flipped through the discussion threads. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded in agreement. \"I agree. There must be someone behind them that's pushing for this, that's why things escalated so quickly. Plus, it seems that they've planned for what happened this time, and I'm not sure why the media reports have been censored. Maybe our director did something?\" </p><p>\"If your director could really do something, then would he still only be a director?\" Qin Chu looked at her nonchalantly.</p><p>\"Uhm… anyways, after the media pressed things down, the patient's family members immediately spread the news all over the forum and then onto their WeChat friend circles. It doesn't seem like something they're capable of doing, given how meticulous this plan is.\" </p><p>\"Have you bothered anyone at the hospital recently?\" asked Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Yes, I have.\" Huo Mian nodded, and then she continued, \"My relationship with one of the doctors in the gynecology department, Wu Xiaoxue, is awful. She's been wanting to get rid of me for quite some time, but the director never approved it. Also, because she's the director's niece, she can do anything she wants in the hospital. A lot of people hate her, but she especially despises me.\" </p><p>\"I don't think a doctor would hate a little nurse for no reason,\" Qin Chu calmly analyzed. </p><p>Just then, Huo Mian coughed and said quietly, \"She's Ning Zhiyuan's current girlfriend, so…\" </p><p>\"Who is Ning Zhiyuan?\" Qin Chu never seemed to care for unimportant names. </p><p>\"Ahem... Ning Zhiyuan was the man I was supposed to marry,\" Huo Mian replied as she tried to explain things. </p><p>Of course, Qin Chu's face turned dark when he heard this…</p><p>\"You really know how to cause trouble for yourself. If you knew that they're working in the same hospital, why didn't you just transfer to another one?\" Qin Chu was upset. </p><p>\"I didn't think that she would be so harsh on me, but this still seems odd. I don't think Wu Xiaoxue did this.\" </p><p>\"Could it be someone else?\" Qin Chu was confused. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, \"I just think that even if Wu Xiaoxue was an idiot, she still wouldn't joke around with the hospital's reputation since she still has to continue working there. Plus, her uncle will also be affected.\" </p><p>\"She could have also done this out of desperation, hurting you completely at the cost of damaging herself as well,\" Qin Chu guessed. </p><p>Huo Mian shook her head once again, \"This doesn't seem like something Wu Xiaoxue would do, given her personality. She might be prideful, but she isn't radical. She wouldn't do something like that to only cause harm to me. Plus, if things were revealed, and people started digging out the names, her ditching work that evening as the on-call doctor would be revealed as well. By then, she will be just as vulnerable as I am.\" </p><p>Qin Chu nodded, as he thought that Huo Mian's deductions made sense, and, after a moment of thought, he asked again, \"Then aside from Wu Xiaoxue, is there anyone else you suspect?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":175,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:11.097","Link":"Chapter-175","NameDisplay":"Chapter 175"},{"ID":181120949115285827,"Name":"Chapter 176: Prey","NameUnsign":"Chapter 176: Prey","Description":"<p>Chapter 176: Prey</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Yes, there is, but I'm only making guesses right now.\" </p><p>\"Do you want me to take care of it for you?\" </p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"It's a battle between women, let me handle it myself. I don't want to be the dumb wife who always hides behind her husband.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's careless words oddly lifted Qin Chu's mood. </p><p>\"So you do know that I'm your husband?\" He sounded cold on the surface but was overjoyed deep down. </p><p>\"Uhm… My head still hurts a lot.\" Huo Mian didn't know what to say, so she pretended that her wound was in pain again. </p><p>\"Have you done a check-up yet? Maybe you sustained an internal injury?\" Qin Chu was worried. </p><p>\"I have, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just a flesh wound.\" </p><p>\"Then you should lie down for a bit, I have to take care of some documents.\" </p><p>After Qin Chu helped Huo Mian onto the sofa, he worked on his laptop beside her. </p><p>He prepared to take her out for food later. </p><p>However, on the other side of town, after the video surfaced, the hospital was seriously affected.</p><p>When Wu Xiaoxue got off work, there were several raw eggs thrown onto her BMW, and she was so angry that she wanted to swear. </p><p>\"Bunch of dumbasses, this has nothing to do with me! It's Huo Mian's fault, why are they bullying me?\" </p><p>\"Maybe they found out that you were the on-call doctor that night,\" said Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>\"No, I've to think of something. I can't let them direct the blame to me.\" </p><p>Then, Ning Zhiyuan and Wu Xiaoxue headed home together. </p><p>That night, Wu Xiaoxue recorded a video and posted it in the forum. She cried about how hard it was for her - how she didn't ditch work on purpose, and that she was pregnant and couldn't stay up too late in fear that it would harm her baby. </p><p>Anyways, Wu Xiaoxue posted the video for the sole purpose of taking the blame off of herself. </p><p>Then, Wu Xiaoxue spent money and bought forum users to reason for her. Excuses included 'pregnant women are the most important', or 'it's so hard for pregnant women', and so on. </p><p>Then, she steered people's blame back at Huo Mian. </p><p>- Meanwhile, inside the private room of some nightclub -</p><p>Su Yu and a few other rich heirs were drinking and singing karaoke when someone amongst those present talked about the incident enthusiastically.</p><p>After Su Yu saw the video Wu Xiaoxue posted, he said, \"She sure knows how to shake off the blame.\" </p><p>\"Huh, are you saying that if that nurse also comes out with that excuse, the public will also view her in a better light? Should she also say that she's pregnant?\" </p><p>\"If everyone used the same excuse, then it's up to the people to believe it. I don't know if the hospital would push that nurse to come forth and admit her crimes in the end, but I hear the hospital has already tried very hard to suppress this,\" another rich heir added. </p><p>\"The hospital doesn't have the ability to suppress the media,\" Su Yu slowly said as he held up a wine glass, swirling it in his hand. </p><p>\"Su, are you saying that there's someone helping that nurse, or helping the hospital?\" </p><p>Su Yu only lifted the corners of his mouth and no longer spoke… </p><p>Just then, a cute, innocent-looking girl walked over and dug her head into Su Yu's shoulders with affection. </p><p>\"I remember telling you to not to use perfume when you're seeing me,\" Su Yu frowned as he looked at the girl with disdain. </p><p>\"Young Master Su, I'm sorry. I was at the press release of my new movie today, so…\" </p><p>\"I don't want to hear excuses, go away.\" Su Yu waved his hand, and forcefully pushed the girl aside, causing her to fall to the floor. </p><p>\"Ahem… you sure know how to treat the ladies with affection,\" laughed a man on the side. </p><p>\"Treat ladies with affection? That's not my style.\" Then, Su Yu devilishly smiled as he walked away, stepping on the girl's fingers as he did. </p><p>The girl's face turned pale from the pain, but she didn't dare to make a sound, because she knew nothing good would come of her if she offended the sugar-daddy. </p><p>Plus, everyone in the circle knew that Su Yu had violent tendencies. </p><p>\"Whoa, seems like Young Master Su has changed his prey,\" a few rich heirs teased on the side. </p><p>Su Yu held up his wine glass and looked out the window at the night scene, a hidden depth filling his eyes. </p><p>Qin Chu took Huo Mian out for dinner after he finished work. Afterward, he called Director Wu when he went to the washroom. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't know what they spoke about, as she only knew that when Qin Chu came back, he said, \"Don't worry about the hospital anymore, I've clearly stated that we will negotiate with the patient and her family members.\"</p><p>\"Are you planning to compensate them?\" Huo Mian was somewhat worried.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":176,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:11.53","Link":"Chapter-176","NameDisplay":"Chapter 176"},{"ID":18112094911986777,"Name":"Chapter 177: An Astronomically High Price","NameUnsign":"Chapter 177: An Astronomically High Price","Description":"<p>Chapter 177: An Astronomically High Price</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"How dumb do you think I am?\" Qin Chu's question made Huo Mian speechless. </p><p>She also knew that Qin Chu wasn't the 'stupid rich' type.</p><p>At this point, if reparations were paid, then it would be equivalent to admitting that she was guilty. </p><p>Plus, this family asked for several million right off the bat, which was completely unreasonable. </p><p>\"What did Director Wu say?\" </p><p>\"He will take care of things at the hospital, you don't have to worry about him anymore.\" </p><p>\"Mhm.\" </p><p>\"I've arranged for negotiations to begin at 6 PM, I'll drive you home to rest in a bit.\" </p><p>\"I'll come with you.\" </p><p>\"No, trust me on this,\" Qin Chu refused. </p><p>Huo Mian no longer insisted. Truth be told, she didn't know what else she could talk about with that group of people. </p><p>However, she had faith in Qin Chu, since he always had his own ways of dealing with things. </p><p>After eating, Huo Mian went back home, sent a WeChat message to Zhu Lingling, and then she fell asleep. </p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Chu arrived at the arranged teahouse to meet with the patient's family. </p><p>The pregnant woman's husband clearly prepared for things, as he brought around seventeen to eighteen people along this time. </p><p>They filled up the private room as if he feared that Qin Chu would beat him up again. </p><p>On the other hand, Qin Chu only brought with him one other person, a forty-something-year-old man in a suit, with gold-rimmed glasses and a polite look. No one knew who he was. </p><p>\"Don't waste time, tell me what you want,\" Qin Chu sat down, took off his jacket, and handed it to the man behind him. </p><p>\"Compensation.\" </p><p>\"How much?\" Qin Chu asked the pregnant woman's husband. </p><p>\"Well, that little nurse has done quite a lot of damage to my wife and daughter, so there's psychological damage fees, medical fees, nutrition fees, survivor allowance, and so on. Naturally, you will have to give us a large sum.\" </p><p>\"Bro, survivor allowance is for the family of the deceased, you've got it wrong.\"</p><p>\"Not survivor allowance, I meant to say consolation fee. Anyways, pay up.\" </p><p>\"How much do you want?\" Qin Chu asked again as he suppressed his temper. </p><p>The man thought about it for a bit, raised his fingers and said, \"Three million. This medical incident is worth at least three million. Plus, you hit me yesterday at the police station. I've already tested for wounds, and it turns out I'm suffering from a concussion. I don't think I can work for the rest of my life, so you must pay me the compensation all at once. With the two together, you can give me five million. I'm a pretty easy-going guy, I won't ask you for more.\" </p><p>Qin Chu looked at him without any emotions as the man spoke. Then, Qin Chu coldly replied, \"You sure have the guts to ask for an amount like this.\" </p><p>\"It's a reasonable amount, and I've also consulted a lawyer about this, so you can't fool me. The hospital said that you'll deal with this completely. I originally wanted the hospital to pay two million, and you one million, but since you're the one causing trouble, then it'll be you who has to pay up.\" </p><p>\"Fine, it's only five million, I agree.\" Qin Chu nodded. </p><p>The man was overwhelmed with joy when he heard this. After he was beaten up by Qin Chu yesterday, he was somewhat afraid of him. </p><p>He thought that the negotiations wouldn't go well today; even if Qin Chu didn't agree to his insanely high asking price, he would slowly decrease the number and would accept down to one million.</p><p>However, to his surprise, not only did Qin Chu not haggle, he agreed so easily. </p><p>\"Then fine, we'll take care of this privately, and I won't cause any more trouble at the hospital. Will you pay in cash, or transfer the funds to my account?\" The man was eager. </p><p>Qin Chu slowly said, \"There's no rush, we took care of your business, but we haven't even dealt with you hurting my wife yet.\" </p><p>\"Oh that, then fine, how about this, I'll give you ten thousand yuan as compensation for the nurse, what do you think?\" The man seemed to think that he was being quite generous, as he offered ten thousand yuan to compensate Huo Mian for the wound on her head.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't speak. Instead, he signaled to the man in the suit behind him, \"Mr. Song, you can take care of the rest.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":177,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:11.987","Link":"Chapter-177","NameDisplay":"Chapter 177"},{"ID":181120949125388444,"Name":"Chapter 178: Beg for Mercy","NameUnsign":"Chapter 178: Beg for Mercy","Description":"<p>Chapter 178: Beg for Mercy</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Got it, sir.\" </p><p>The man behind Qin Chu nodded as he took out a heavy set of documents from his briefcase and placed it on the table, \"Ms. Huo Mian, my client's wife, was pushed by you at the hospital entrance and suffered an injury on her head.\" </p><p>\"It was only a light wound, so don't try to extort me. She even checked it at the hospital and found that there's nothing wrong. Even the police know that,\" the man explained in a hurry. </p><p>Mr. Song continued, \"Let me finish first. The police indeed isn't pursuing this anymore, but my client purchased a major personal insurance on Huo Mian a month ago, and it was an insurance based on different body parts. Huo Mian's head insurance was fifty million, which means that once Huo Mian is wounded, no matter if the injury was inflicted by human or by nature, the insurance company would still compensate for it.\" </p><p>\"Then go ask the insurance company for it.\" The man grew unsettled. </p><p>\"If it was caused by nature, the insurance company would naturally compensate for it. But this time, it was caused by you, so the insurance company will sue you, which means that if you don't pay the fifty million in damages, the insurance company can sue you for deliberate injury. You'll face a minimum sentence of five to ten years in prison.\"</p><p>\"What? Are you kidding me?\" The man was completely dumbfounded. </p><p>\"Sorry, I never 'kid'.\" Mr. Song was the first counsel of GK Corporation's legal team, and, of course, was a man of his words.</p><p>\"It's only a bump on her head. Is there a need to pay that much? What are you guys talking about? You might as well go rob a bank. Plus, I don't believe that anyone would place such a heavy insurance on a woman's head, it's not scientific.\" </p><p>It seemed like this pregnant woman's husband wasn't a hooligan. At least he could tell what was scientific and what wasn't. </p><p>Just then, Mr. Song very seriously took out a page from his stack of documents, passed it over to the man, and said, \"If you read this page closely, my client's wife, Huo Mian, was tested when she was eight years old. She is a genius with an IQ of 130. All of her future aspirations depends on her brain, so naturally her head must be well protected.\" </p><p>\"Do you think that I'd believe it? If she's a genius, or whatever, why would she still be a little nurse?\" The man clearly doubtful. </p><p>Qin Chu picked up his jacket, brushed off the dust, and calmly said, \"You should be thankful that she was a nurse, or else she wouldn't have saved your wife and daughter that night. Instead, you paid back her kindness with greed, so you better be prepared for what's about to happen today. Okay, I'm a busy person, so we'll end things here today. The insurance company and my legal team will contact you for subsequent procedures. You should head home and think about whether you want to pay up or end up in jail.\" </p><p>After he spoke, Qin Chu turned around and left, as Mr. Song gathered the documents and followed behind Qin Chu into his luxurious Maybach. </p><p>\"Bro, that kid's car seems pretty luxurious... Did we piss off the wrong person this time?\" the man's brother asked carefully. </p><p>The man raised his neck, and after he saw the car's symbol, he shouted, \"What luxurious car? That's only an 'M' symbol, it's clearly a Volkswagen Magotan! It's only worth a couple hundred thousand, you call that luxurious? Who does he think he's tricking? I won't believe a word he said, let's go.\" </p><p>The man ignored what Qin Chu said until he received a court order later that night. </p><p>Turns out, the insurance company had already investigated the man and didn't think that his family would be able to afford the fifty million compensation fee. </p><p>So there was no need for negotiations, and they directly summoned the man to court. </p><p>Meanwhile, the court, afraid that the man would escape on account of the large amount, ordered policemen to his home to place him into temporary custody that night. This immediately shocked all of the previously pregnant woman's family members. </p><p>At night, when Qin Chu went out to meet with clients, he received a call from the insurance company. </p><p>They were very polite, and they said the fifty million had already been transferred to his personal account.</p><p>If you thought that Qin Chu earned plenty this time, then you're more than wrong. </p><p>That was because beginning last month, Qin Chu had to pay the insurance company a million in insurance fees each month. </p><p>The insurance wasn't just for Huo Mian's head; her hands and legs had been insured heavily as well. </p><p>A million a month, until Huo Mian turns sixty… </p><p>The rich could indeed be capricious. However, Qin Chu didn't insure Huo Mian so that he would receive compensation. </p><p>It was because more than anything, Qin Chu wanted to ensure that whoever harmed Huo Mian had to either pay out a large sum or, if they couldn't afford it, be sued by the insurance company. </p><p>By then, the perpetrator would face jail, which was his ultimate goal. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't know any of this. She was at home, eating chips and watching cartoons.</p><p>Just then, Huo Mian received a call from the pregnant woman. The woman cried, \"Huo Mian, I'm sorry! We're sorry!

We thought we could use this opportunity to get tons of money from the hospital. In the end, greed blinded our eyes, but we now know that we were truly wrong. Please give us another chance; my two kids need their father around. I'm terrified that I'll lose him.

Then, the pregnant woman sent over many texts, most of them were extremely polite and begged for mercy. </p><p>At this point, Huo Mian didn't seem to pity the woman anymore, as she only thought, why did they have to do what they did if they knew what they were doing was wrong? </p><p>If Qin Chu didn't help Huo Mian take care of things, then would they still let her off the hook? </p><p>If she forgave them, then who would prove her innocence? </p><p>Plus, this situation had been greatly magnified... </p><p>When Qin Chu came back, Huo Mian had already made dinner. There were meat and vegetable dishes, which smelled and tasted delicious. </p><p>Huo Mian's cooking always enticed Qin Chu's appetite. He ate two bowls of rice.</p><p>While they were eating, Huo Mian snuck peaks at Qin Chu. </p><p>\"You've something to tell me?\" asked Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Ahem… You eat quite a lot but you're not fat at all.

If you don't get to the point, then I'll be in the study for a video conference in a bit.\" </p><p>He pushed back all the month-end meetings with the seven branch companies that was supposed to happen the other day because he was busy taking care of Huo Mian's thing. </p><p>A pile of work was pushed back and was waiting for him to take care of, so he didn't have any time to discuss the trick to maintaining his body shape with Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian decided to be straightforward too, upon seeing how direct Qin Chu was. </p><p>\"How did you deal with that family? His wife called me today and begged for mercy.\" </p><p>\"He brought it onto himself,\" said Qin Chu coldly. </p><p>\"I think so too, but I hear that the man might go to jail. He did push me that day, but the police already tested for wounds, and Gao Ran knows about this. There's nothing wrong with me, so why would that man go to jail? Did you sue him for blackmailing?\" Huo Mian knew that Qin Chu's legal team was quite powerful, so they might have used this as an excuse. </p><p>\"He won't be sued for blackmailing. Even if he were, it would only be a two or three-year sentence, what's the point of that?\" </p><p>\"Then he…?\" Huo Mian wanted to say something but stopped. </p><p>\"I've already taken care of this, there's no need for you to ask anymore. Anyways, remember to tell me when things like this happen in the future.\" Qin Chu didn't plan on telling Huo Mian too much and wasn't going to tell her about the hundred-million insurance fees. </p><p>He did all of this for her in secrecy… </p><p>Seeing that Qin Chu didn't want to tell her, Huo Mian stopped asking. She knew that Qin Chu had always had his own reasons behind his actions. </p><p>Before the video conference, Qin Chu made a phone call, and, an hour later, every major media outlet revealed the truth of the incident. </p><p>They all publicly denounced the pregnant woman and her husband as greedy pursuers of money and posed Huo Mian as the hero. </p><p>Even though she wasn't a doctor, she had high professional ethics. Within a single night, Huo Mian turned from criminal to celebrity. </p><p>In front of the television, the pregnant woman cried, \"My whole family has wronged Huo Mian. We blackmailed her instead of thanking her, and now we've been punished by karma. We only hope that Huo Mian will be the bigger person in this and give us a chance to make things right.\" </p><p>Huo Mian had just taken a bath when she came out to see her phone exploding with messages.</p><p>She read the head nurse's message first, \"Huo Mian, turn to the evening news channel.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":179,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:13.063","Link":"Chapter-179","NameDisplay":"Chapter 179"},{"ID":181120949135794649,"Name":"Chapter 180: The Hand Pulling the Strings","NameUnsign":"Chapter 180: The Hand Pulling the Strings","Description":"<p>Chapter 180: The Hand Pulling the Strings</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>After seeing the message left by the head nurse, she immediately turned on the TV in the living room and saw the live broadcast of the evening news. </p><p>The pregnant patient was being interviewed, and, on the other side of the TV, she apologized to Huo Mian in front of everyone. </p><p>She told the truth of that night and even showed the results of her exams, proving that she did not have any residual effects whatsoever. Everything they said to frame Huo Mian had been fabricated in an attempt to get money because she and her husband were greedy.  </p><p>Everybody condemned her after she told the truth… </p><p>On C City's First Forum, the user account that continually voiced this issue and slandered Huo Mian and the First Hospital was deleted.</p><p>Many reporters got Huo Mian's cell-phone number out of nowhere, and they kept calling her, blowing up her phone.  </p><p>Huo Mian saw two hundred missed calls and suddenly felt overwhelmed.  </p><p>She laid on her bed, WeChatting with Zhu Lingling, Huang Yue, and the head nurse. </p><p>The whole thing was finally straightened out. She certainly knew it was because Qin Chu had his hands on the situation. </p><p>If it was not for Qin Chu, this issue would not have been resolved so fast. </p><p>It was already midnight when Qin Chu finished his meeting. After taking a shower, he walked out in his robe. </p><p>Huo Mian was already asleep, so he gently got into bed. tucked her in, then laid next to her. </p><p>He knew very well how powerful the news and media were. From now on, if anybody ever dared to use the media to bully his wife, he would make their lives miserable. </p><p>He looked at Huo Mian's sleeping face, pink cheeks, and slightly curled eyelashes. She was sleeping like a baby. </p><p>Qin Chu's heart melted. His eyes filled with endless and spoiling love for her. </p><p>He carefully left a kiss on Huo Mian's cheek like a dragonfly who lightly skipped on the water. Then he whispered in her ear, \"Goodnight.\" </p><p>The next morning after breakfast, Qin Chu left for work and Huo Mian got ready to go to the hospital. </p><p>Her three-day vacation was pretty much over and the whole drama quieted down. It was time to go back to work. </p><p>Little did she know, the second she arrived at the First Hospital, the pregnant patient who had just given birth kneeled down and tightly latched onto Huo Mian's legs. </p><p>\"What are you doing? Get up.\" Huo Mian was shocked. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, I beg you. Please let us go. We are sorry, and we straightened things out with the press last night. Please ask them to let my husband go. My children and I can't live without him.\" </p><p>Then, the woman started bawling again… </p><p>\"You still need to rest a month after giving birth and can't come outside. If you have anything to say, let's talk in private.\" Huo Mian extended her arms and tried to help her stand up. </p><p>However, the woman didn't want to get up, instead turning to the camera not far from her and saying, \"If you don't promise me, I won't stop kneeling.\" </p><p>Then, she said to a seven or eight year old girl and an old lady holding a baby, \"Come over here and get down on your knees. Ask her to save your dad.\" </p><p>Hearing her words, the old lady kneeled down with the baby in her arms. The little girl didn't seem to understand what was going on but also got down on her knees. </p><p>The whole family, both old and young, were all on their knees in front of the hospital. Huo Mian didn't know that they would go so far to put up a show. </p><p>\"Stand up, I already forgave you. As for your husband, I will help get him out.\" </p><p>In front of the media, Huo Mian had no other choice but to go easy on them. If she once pitied this woman, she had now lost all sentiments towards her. She was a total manipulative b*tch. If she really wanted to apologize, she could just talk to Huo Mian in private. Why put on this big of a show? Who was it for? Even now, she was still trying to use the pressure of public attention to corner Huo Mian. </p><p>Huo Mian was really speechless… </p><p>\"Really? Thank you. You are such a good person, Huo Mian.\"</p><p>\"But you have to tell me. Who was behind all this?\" Huo Mian calmly questioned her.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":180,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:13.58","Link":"Chapter-180","NameDisplay":"Chapter 180"},{"ID":18112094914236460,"Name":"Chapter 181: Concern","NameUnsign":"Chapter 181: Concern","Description":"<p>Chapter 181: Concern</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"This is really…?\"</p><p>Not waiting for the woman to finish her explanation, Huo Mian interrupted her impatiently, \"Don't play this cheap trick on me. Let's make a deal. You tell me who they are, and I will find a way to get your husband out. Then this will all be over.\" </p><p>Seeing that Huo Mian was firm on this, the woman got up and said something in her ear. Huo Mian nodded upon hearing what she said. </p><p>Then she said, towards all the press, \"Dear friends from the press, thank you for your continuous close attention on this issue. The cause was simple. I just wanted to save people. However, it all went in a direction that has deviated from my original intent. I apologize to Director Wu for the negative impact our hospital had received because of me. I would not have come this far if I didn't have his trust and support. At the same time, I am even more grateful to my family for their support when I was at rock bottom and for helping me find the truth and prove my innocence. Anyways, please don't follow this matter further. Thank you.\" </p><p>Then, Huo Mian turned around and went into the hospital. The incident officially came to an end. </p><p>What Huo Mian said in front of the hospital was later broadcasted on every major channel. </p><p>Qin Chu was going over financial receipts when he heard Huo Mian's voice. He slowly raised his head and looked at the TV. </p><p>Assistant Yang met Huo Mian once, so he could roughly guess that the nurse who was in trouble this time was his boss's girlfriend. </p><p>That's why he purposely turned on the TV when Huo Mian was live. </p><p>It surely caught Qin Chu's attention. His eyes became gentle and tender when he saw Huo Mian express gratitude towards her family. </p><p>She was finally willing to admit his existence? </p><p>\"Sir, my sister-in-law is getting married the day after tomorrow. Can I have the morning off? I will be back by lunch,\" Assistant Yang asked while the president was in a good mood. </p><p>\"You can take the entire day off.\" </p><p>\"Thank you, sir!\" Assistant Yang was ecstatic. He knew it would be best to bring up a request when his boss was in a good mood. </p><p>- In the director's office - </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue said indignantly, \"Uncle, this matter has already had a negative impact on the hospital. You have to fire Huo Mian, or else it is likely to happen again.\" </p><p>\"I know what to do. You don't need to tell me over and over again.\" </p><p>\"Uncle, I really don't understand. Huo Mian is just a little nurse. Why are you protecting her so much? Did she bribe you?\" </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue was angry, and she started to speak without carefully choosing her words. </p><p>Director Wu's face grew a shade darker, \"Xiaoxue, don't be ridiculous. This is the hospital, not your home. I am Director Wu here, not your uncle.\" </p><p>\"I'm not giving in. I want you to fire Huo Mian.\" </p><p>\"There's no way I'll fire Huo Mian. If there's nothing else, you can leave now.\" He waved his hand, gesturing for Wu Xiaoxue to leave. </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue was furious. She slammed the door and stormed out… as a protest against her uncle's decision. </p><p>The director's assistant probed, \"Director, why didn't you tell Miss Wu your concern? You know, the power behind Huo Mian.\" </p><p>\"It would only add to the drama. I better not tell her.\" </p><p>Admiring Huo Mian's talent was only one of the reasons why Director Wu kept defending her. </p><p>The main reason was still Qin Chu… </p><p>His idiot niece kept hooting about firing Huo Mian, but he would be the idiot if he did so. </p><p>It was peaceful when Huo Mian arrived back to the hospital. The OB/GYN department was as busy as it had always been. </p><p>After work, Huo Mian didn't go straight home but instead went to the address that the pregnant patient gave her. </p><p>As expected, Huo Mian saw a woman's back. She was dressed provocatively, and her hips bounced when she walked. </p><p>Huo Mian secretly followed her into the corridor of an apartment and sped up to stop her. </p><p>\"Hi, He Man, long time no see.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, what are you doing here?\" He Man was a little scared.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":181,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:14.023","Link":"Chapter-181","NameDisplay":"Chapter 181"},{"ID":18112094914548538,"Name":"Chapter 182: Leave","NameUnsign":"Chapter 182: Leave","Description":"<p>Chapter 182: Leave</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I bet you didn't expect me to find out so fast, did you?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean, I don't know what you are talking about,\" He Man looked away, clearly guilty.</p><p>\"I have to admit that I was wondering who in the world hated me enough to do something like this. However, it seems like Ning Zhiyuan was the one who hurt you. You need to target the person who owes you, not do despicable things behind other people's backs.\"</p><p>\"I don't know what you're talking about. Move, I'm going home.\" He Man didn't want to continue their conversation.</p><p>However, Huo Mian blocked her way, clearly not about to let her go.</p><p>\"You're good, setting this up and tricking everyone. You deceived that couple, Wu Xiaoxue was forced to become the scapegoat, and you set me up. You pushed me to the edge of the cliff. It was a good plan, hitting two birds with one stone. Too bad you underestimated me.\"</p><p>\"Do you have proof that I did it? Did you or did you not make the decision to operate on that pregnant patient?\" He Man sneered.</p><p>\"Yes, I did, but someone twisted the truth. Yuan Fenfen told me exactly what happened. You probably didn't think that I would find out so soon, right? After all, you thought your plan was foolproof.\"</p><p>\"If there's no concrete proof, I won't admit to it. You won't be able to do anything about it.\" He Man raised her head. She knew that even if things unraveled, all she had to do was shirk from responsibility and make the couple her scapegoats.</p><p>\"I used to feel bad for all the tragedies that happened to you. But now, I feel like everything that happened can just be considered as karma for someone like you.\"</p><p>Perhaps Huo Mian's words triggered her, He Mian suddenly looked at Huo Mian and raised her hand to slap her.</p><p>However, Huo Mian interjected her hand. She pushed He Man onto the wall and locked her hand tightly around her neck.</p><p>\"Do you know who I despise the most? People who go behind others' backs to stab them. Either you challenge me directly or get the hell away from me. He Man, you might not know this, but I have a thousand ways to make your life miserable. This is just a warning, next time, I won't be so nice. Remember that, or else you'll end up worse than you are now.\"</p><p>Then, Huo Mian let go of He Man's neck, turned on her heel, and left.</p><p>He Man's legs were shaking. Just then, she really thought that she was going to die.</p><p>Huo Mian's hand was tightly wrapped around her neck. She was strong, and almost suffocated her.</p><p>However, Huo Mian controlled her strength, and just as He Man was about to pass out, she let her go.</p><p>She was horrified by Huo Mian's expression. She used to think that Huo Mian would be easy to deal with and that Wu Xiaoxue was the tough one.</p><p>Now, it seemed like Wu Xiaoxue was just a brainless idiot; Huo Mian, on the other hand, was the real terrifying opponent.</p><p>After He Man resigned, she kept in contact with some of the nurses. One time, after she heard about Huo Mian's surgery, she thought of a plan to make the hospital pay. At the same time, she would be able to teach Wu Xiaoxue and Huo Mian a lesson. Moreover, after everything, Yuan Fenfen's husband promised to give her 100,000 yuan as a thank you. That's how she became the mastermind behind that incident.</p><p>However, to her surprise, her plan failed and Huo Mian found out. Huo Mian's warning just now had frightened her.</p><p>She couldn't imagine why a person like Huo Mian would fall for a good-for-nothing man like Ning Zhiyuan in the first place.</p><p>The next morning, as soon as Huo Mian arrived at the hospital, Huang Yue ran up to grab her hand, \"Mian, did you see the hospital announcement? You were transferred to the First Hospital's South Side Recuperation Center!\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"How can you still be smiling! South Side is the hardest place to work at, no one wants to go! Go find the head nurse and ask her to talk to the director. Trust me, you don't want to go there.\"</p><p>\"I was the one who asked the director to transfer me to South Side.\" Huo Mian gave her a little smile.</p><p>\"What? You asked to go? Are you crazy, Big Sis Mian? Why would you want to go there?\" Huang Yue was completely flabbergasted.</p><p>South Side Recuperation Center, an affiliate of the First Hospital, was known for its difficult work environment.</p><p>The center was filled with the province's high-level officials, billionaires, and the heirs of rich families. They were extremely hard to take care of, and the employees there were often cursed at and beaten. Apparently, last month, a doctor lost 4 teeth because he said something wrong to one of the patients. However, the incident was resolved quietly because the patient was rich enough to shut them up with money.</p><p>Huang Yue was confused – why would Huo Mian go to a place as infamous as South Side?</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":182,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:14.55","Link":"Chapter-182","NameDisplay":"Chapter 182"},{"ID":181120949151805696,"Name":"Chapter 183: Drunk","NameUnsign":"Chapter 183: Drunk","Description":"<p>Chapter 183: Drunk</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Because of this incident, I don't have the face to stay here anymore, even if the director allows me to. However, I don't want to be transferred to another hospital, because a good boss like Director Wu is hard to come across. Director Wu is in charge of South Side as well, so I mentioned it to him. He objected at first because he thinks I won't be able to handle the stress there, but after seeing my persistence, he agreed.\"</p><p>\"But you don't have to do this to yourself. If you don't want to stay at this location, why don't you ask to be transferred to the West Side Infertility Clinic? I heard that they're hiring as well,\" Huang Yue suggested.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her hands immediately, \"When I worked in the OB/GYN Department, I was tired, but my heart was at ease because we helped newborns come to this world every day. I'd rather die than work at West Side! Seeing couples with reproductive problems being forced to come in and out of the hospital every day will make me depressed. A person's work environment affects their mood. South Side Recuperation Center is filled with patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy, so the work won't be too stressful. Plus, I heard that South Side's salary is the highest of all the hospitals, it's three times more than what I earn here.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was telling the truth; she hadn't been offered a permanent position yet, so her monthly salary was only a little more than two grand.</p><p>On the other hand, nurses at South Side Recuperation Center earned around six to seven grand every month. It made sense; people who looked after rich people should be paid more. Otherwise, no one else would want to do it.</p><p>\"Yeah right, you're not one to care about salary, you're just trying to get me off your case.\" Huang Yue still didn't understand why Huo Mian was so set on working at South Side, but she knew that it wasn't for the money.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled but said nothing more. Huang Yue hugged her, \"Mian, I'll miss you so much. We've worked together for so long, and I'm really sad to see you leave.\"</p><p>\"If it weren't for South Side's notorious reputation, I would definitely ask you to leave with me.\"</p><p>\"Forget it, I'm not going there. I'd rather quit than go work at South Side!\" Huang Yue immediately waved her hands.</p><p>Huo Mian joked, \"But I heard a lot of young and pretty nurses want to work there, just so they can find a rich boy to marry.\"</p><p>\"I'll pass on the rich boys, marrying rich isn't as easy as you think. Most end up becoming the mistresses or play toys of rich men. Men invest their money while women invest their emotions. It's not an equal transaction, I won't do it. It's not worth it.\"</p><p>Huo Mian happily patted Huang Yue on her shoulder upon hearing this. \"You're right, humans shouldn't be so greedy. It's hard to be a wife of a wealthy man – just look at the celebrities on TV. Once they marry rich, some suffer physical abuse but are afraid to complain. They have no choice but to swallow everything. It's better to live happily alone than in suffocation.\"</p><p>\"You're right, Mian. I will keep that in mind forever. If you can't stand working there, remember to request to come back, okay? The director is really nice to you.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>Huo Mian's transfer to South Side Recuperation Center was later announced by the hospital. At the same time, she was offered a permanent position. Huo Mian was no longer an intern.</p><p>Her colleagues at the OB/GYN department, including the head nurse, and Chief Han of the laboratory, suggested that they have dinner together as a farewell party to Huo Mian.</p><p>It was hard to turn down their kindness, so Huo Mian made reservations at a restaurant. The group headed there together after work.</p><p>During dinner, she sent a message to Qin Chu telling him that she'll be late, but he didn't reply.</p><p>Everyone was excited after dinner, so they went out for karaoke. It was 11 PM by the time their party ended.</p><p>After Huo Mian saw everyone off, she held out her hand to wave down a cab.</p><p>However, a Maybach took up the lane before her cab could arrive.</p><p>\"Hm? Cabs these days sure are luxurious,\" Huo Mian, drunk, mumbled to herself.</p><p>\"How much did you drink? I can't believe you can't even recognize my car,\" Qin Chu rolled down the window with a grim expression on his face.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":183,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:15.18","Link":"Chapter-183","NameDisplay":"Chapter 183"},{"ID":181120949156555871,"Name":"Chapter 184: Drunk Personality","NameUnsign":"Chapter 184: Drunk Personality","Description":"<p>Chapter 184: Drunk Personality</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>It wasn't until Qin Chu got off the car did Huo Mian recognize who it was. Smiling like an idiot, she exclaimed, \"Hey, it's you! Why are you here?\"</p><p>Qin Chu's expression was grim, but he remained silent. He picked Huo Mian up and dropped her onto the passenger seat. After buckling up her seat belt, the pair drove off.</p><p>It was already close to 10 PM when Qin Chu finished running errands. He had to drop by his family's mansion.</p><p>His father was interested in investing in a 5-billion-yuan project, so he asked Qin Chu to come over and talk about it.</p><p>In the end, he and his father held different opinions and their conversation went stale. Qin Chu called Huo Mian as soon as he left.</p><p>At that time, Huo Mian had gone to the bathroom, so Huang Yue was the one who picked up her phone.</p><p>Huang Yue drank a lot as well, so she vaguely blurted out the address of the karaoke place they were at.</p><p>That's how Qin Chu got there. He waited outside for over an hour before he saw Huo Mian come out.</p><p>She was already swaying as she walked in an S-shaped pattern, but she still had the frame of mind to help others get cabs first.</p><p>She didn't think of herself until everyone else left? Who was his wife, Robinhood?</p><p>Wasn't she worried that illegitimate cab drivers would kidnap her, take her out to the countryside and then rape and kill her? Was she really a genius? Did she not know about safety precautions? He couldn't believe that just a while ago, because she expressed her gratitude towards him on TV, he let that pregnant patient's husband off the hook and got the insurance company to retract their lawsuit. He was always thinking of her, but she drank herself into oblivion.</p><p>\"Have some water,\" Qin Chu handed her a bottle.</p><p>Huo Mian chugged the water but immediately threw up.</p><p>All her puke was aimed at the driver's seat and splashed all over Qin Chu's pants.</p><p>He was wearing Versace's limited-edition pants, not to mention that it was worth more than 100,000 yuan.</p><p>The point was, Qin Chu was a germaphobe! Was it really okay for her to just throw up all over him?</p><p>\"Huo…Mian…\" Qin Chu gritted his teeth and growled.</p><p>\"Here!\"</p><p>\"Damn it, no more alcohol for you again.\" Qin Chu festered for a while but didn't know what else to say.</p><p>Yell at her? He didn't have the heart to. Finally, all he could do was warn her not to drink again. It was a first for him to see someone act like this when they're drunk.</p><p>\"No, I like alcohol, it tastes good. Mixing red wine with Sprite is better than mixing it with black tea,\" Huo Mian fell back in her seat and mumbled.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't want to argue with her. Stepping on the gas pedal, the car instantly took off and they were home in minutes.</p><p>After they got off the car and went upstairs, Qin Chu immediately carried Huo Mian to the second-floor bathroom.</p><p>After he filled the tub with water, he dropped Huo Mian right in…</p><p>\"Have a nice bath.\" Qin Chu was furious.</p><p>\"I want bubbles, why aren't there any bubbles?\" Huo Mian pouted as she began splashing water everywhere with her hands.</p><p>Qin Chu patiently pumped some body wash into the bath water, and white bubbles slowly began to form.</p><p>Qin Chu bent down and tried out the temperature; it was perfect, so he got up to leave.</p><p>Huo Mian suddenly smashed her hands on the water to create a giant water dome, drenching Qin Chu entirely.</p><p>Seething, Qin Chu held down Huo Mian's arms and warned, \"No more moving, take your bath.\"</p><p>\"Hey, you have really pretty eyelashes. They're really pretty,\" Huo Mian said as she moved closer to Qin Chu. Her lips came down onto his eyelashes, nuzzling them.</p><p>Qin Chu felt his defense come crashing down, slowly but surely…</p><p>He really wanted to take her, then and there. However, she was drunk and not clear headed.</p><p>He couldn't, he definitely couldn't… His mind thought as his body felt stuck to her, unable to move.</p><p>\"Let me tell you a secret, Qin Chu.

Who in the world will be unfortunate enough to marry him?'\" Huo Mian laughed idiotically after saying this.</p><p>She didn't notice how bad Qin Chu's expression was… Was it that unfortunate to be his wife?</p><p>She thought he looked devilish? The little wicked girl's courage obviously grew with age.</p><p>If Huo Mian wasn't drunk, he would seriously consider throwing her out from the 16th floor.</p><p>\"Ugh…\" Unable to control the churning in her stomach, she threw up again. Once again, Qin Chu failed to escape from the disaster zone.</p><p>However, compared to the first time, he was much calmer the second time around and didn't become furious at all.</p><p>He undressed Huo Mian and threw her clothes into the other bathroom.</p><p>First, he helped her shower, and then he took a shower himself.

You threw up twice, once in my car and once in the bathroom. I took off your clothes and helped you shower. Oh, and I was the one who washed and dried all the dirty clothes,\" Qin Chu said everything in one breath.</p><p>Huo Mian's face turned crimson by the time he finished…</p><p>He helped her shower? Did that mean he saw everything?</p><p>\"Looks like you … had a lot to do last night.\" Huo Mian sat down by the table. She picked up the glass of warm milk and began drinking it slowly.</p><p>\"Thanks for acknowledging that. Next time, you should drink less.\"</p><p>\"I didn't actually drink that much, haha.\" Huo Mian chuckled.</p><p>If Qin Chu found out that she drank three bottles of red wine, two bottles of beer and a bottle of liquor, he would probably kill her.</p><p>\"I don't need to go to work, it's Sunday so I have the day off. Starting tomorrow, I will be working at the South Side Recuperation Center,\" Huo Mian slowly said.</p><p>Qin Chu wasn't interested in her change of job. He nodded, \"South Side is a little far.\"</p><p>\"If I take the bus, it's only 45 minutes and 2 transfers away,\" Huo Mian thought otherwise.</p><p>\"So that means you'll be working night shifts again?\" Qin Chu suddenly remembered this; his face turned grim.</p><p>\"Um…\" Guilty, Huo Mian didn't dare to say more.</p><p>\"I don't have a problem with you working night shifts. It's your job, your freedom. I respect you, but you have to respect me as well.\"</p><p>\"How would you like me to respect you?\" Huo Mian knew that Qin Chu had more to say.</p><p>\"Take the Volkswagen CC then, it'll save you time from commuting to work.

Their most famous dish was the House Special Spiced Chicken. Apparently, this dish was first marinated with their secret recipe for 24 hours before it was barbequed using low heat until golden. The meat was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and its aromatic scent could be smelled from miles away. This was a must-order dish at this restaurant.</p><p>Qin Chu was a man of many connections; the restaurant was usually packed and rarely had open tables available.</p><p>However, not only did the four of them get seats, they were also placed in the best private room within the restaurant.</p><p>Qin Chu and Huo Mian ordered a dozen specialty dishes after they arrived. Coincidentally, Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling bumped into each other downstairs.</p><p>They hadn't seen each other in years. Therefore, it was only natural for them to shoot cynical remarks at each other.</p><p>Gao Ran's black jaguar took up two parking spots, causing Zhu Lingling to have nowhere to park her Mazda. Of course she was going to complain about it.</p><p>Just as she was about to get off the car to talk to the driver, she saw Gao Ran.</p><p>\"Why are you here?\" Zhu Lingling frowned.</p><p>\"Hey, Zhu Lingling, no time no see.\" Gao Ran knew that he was meeting Zhu Lingling and Huo Mian for lunch, so he wasn't surprised at all.</p><p>\"Move your sh*tty car. It's taking up two parking spots. Don't be unreasonable.\"</p><p>\"I thought you were against Japanese products back in high school, why did you buy a Japanese car?\" Gao Ran rebutted.</p><p>Zhu Lingling rolled her eyes at him and snapped, \"Back when the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China, the United States and Great Britain were the most aggressive of them all. Why would you buy a Jaguar?\"</p><p>\"Haha, I don't think you understand. Thanks to the financial crisis, Ford sold Jaguar to India in 2008, so it's Indian-owned now. Please get your facts together before trying to teach me a lesson.\"</p><p>\"An Indian car? Still doesn't make you a patriot,\" Zhu Lingling glared at Gao Ran as she backed up her car into a parking spot that had just opened up.</p><p>They entered the private room one after the other. Huo Mian smiled, \"Did you guys get a chance to catch up? You haven't seen each other in years.\"</p><p>\"Of course not, I wasn't close to that egomaniac back then anyway,\" Zhu Lingling immediately declared her stance.</p><p>Gao Ran glanced at her, \"It's not like I liked you back then either. You think you're better than everyone because you're a flight attendant, right?\"</p><p>\"Being a flight attendant is better than being a cop, all you people do is take our tax dollars and do nothing.\"</p><p>They seemed like enemies in a spat, and Huo Mian was getting a headache just listening to them.</p><p>It's all because of stupid Qin Chu and his stupid idea; he seemed to be enjoying himself, playing with his phone as he listened to them bicker.</p><p>\"Have you ordered?\" Gao Ran asked.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded, and then said to the waiter by the door, \"You can serve the dishes now.\"</p><p>\"Hey, let's make a deal, I'm buying today. Chu, don't think about grabbing the bill first,\" Gao Ran declared.</p><p>\"Sounds good, I won't fight over the bill with you.\" Qin Chu smiled; he was in a good mood.</p><p>As soon as Zhu Lingling heard that Gao Ran was buying, she turned around and asked the waiter, \"Excuse me, do you guys have red wine?\"</p><p>\"Yes we do, miss, what would you like?\"</p><p>\"I'd like a bottle of your most expensive wine.\"</p><p>\"I'll go get it for you, please wait.\"</p><p>Smiling, Zhu Lingling looked down at the menu. The most expensive bottle of red wine was 3888 yuan.</p><p>Gao Ran laughed, \"Is one bottle enough? Should we order another one?\"</p><p>\"Do you think I'm afraid of you? Waiter, get me two bottles of that wine.\" Zhu Lingling was unwilling to back down.</p><p>\"I don't care how many bottles you order, but I hate wasting, so you better drink it all,\" Gao Ran snickered.</p><p>\"Of course I will.\"</p><p>\"Lingling, will you be able to finish it all?\" Huo Mian secretly tugged at the corner of her friend's shirt.</p><p>\"So what if I can't, you can, right? You're the heavyweight. I heard that you guys drank a lot last night, how much did you drink? More than five bottles?\"</p><p>Huo Mian immediately reached out to cover Zhu Lingling's mouth, gesturing for her to stop. She was afraid that someone else at the table might explode.</p><p>Then, Qin Chu put away his phone and said, enunciating every word, \"People who can't handle their booze shouldn't flaunt.\"</p><p>\"Ha, you got drunk last night? Did you lose it?\" Zhu Lingling looked at Huo Mian with an evil expression on her face.</p><p>Before Huo Mian could answer, Gao Ran suddenly interjected, \"So you guys had fun last night, eh?

He smiled, \"Stop changing the subject, you didn't answer me yet.\"</p><p>\"There's nothing to say, our relationship is pure, it's not what you think.\"</p><p>\"Not what I think? Then what is it? Just missionary?\" Gao Ran's curiosity shot over the roof; he began loudly guessing at the private details between the married couple.</p><p>\"Lingling, look at him, he's just as wicked as he used to be. It's a shame that he's just a policeman, he should be a paparazzi. He can interview celebrities until they cry,\" Huo Mian exclaimed.</p><p>She thought that Zhu Lingling would stand on her side and snap at Gao Ran for her.</p><p>However, to her surprise, Zhu Lingling said, \"Gao Ran's not wrong.\"</p><p>Huo Min was completely speechless.</p><p>\"You guys do form a good team, you should get married,\" Qin Chu glared at Zhu Lingling as he suddenly remembered how she messed up his chance to reach euphoria a few days ago all because of a phone call from her. He was furious.</p><p>\"Spare me please, I don't have the guts to marry a tigress like her,\" Gao Ran objected at once.</p><p>\"Don't worry, I won't marry you even if you kneel down and beg me. If all the men on this world died and all that was left were you and a pig, I'll pick the pig,\" Zhu Lingling said as she gritted her teeth.</p><p>Gao Ran began laughing at her remarks.</p><p>\"You sure have interesting taste…\"</p><p>\"You…\" Zhu Lingling wanted to fight back, but Huo Mian stopped her.</p><p>If she didn't, they wouldn't be able to enjoy a meal together in peace. It's all because of Qin Chu and his stupid idea, why did he suggest that the four of them have lunch together?</p><p>After they finally finished eating lunch, Huo Mian wanted to spend some time alone with Zhu Lingling.</p><p>However, Qin Chu lingered, with obviously no intention of leaving…</p><p>\"Should we part ways here?\" Huo Mian suggested.</p><p>\"Where are you guys going?\"</p><p>Before Huo Mian could answer, Zhu Lingling said, \"We were thinking about going to the Superhero Valley, I hear it's a lot of fun.\"</p><p>\"Superhero Valley?\" Qin Chu had never heard of it.</p><p>Gao Ran immediately explained, \"Oh, that place. It's supposedly the second largest amusement park in Asia. I heard that the Giant Group invested more than 5 billion yuan in its construction, and the park is home to Asia's longest roller coaster and other stuff like that. Kids like it there.\"</p><p>\"Get in the car.\" Qin Chu glanced at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Huh?\" Huo Mian was dumbfounded; did Qin Chu want to go with them?</p><p>In the end, the four of them drove three cars to the Superhero Valley. It was Sunday, and the park was crowded with people.</p><p>To save time, Huo Mian decided not to stand in line for all the rides. They decided to only ride the drop tower and a roller coaster.</p><p>After the four of them got off the roller coaster, Gao Ran's legs gave in… Face pale, he wanted to throw up but couldn't.</p><p>\"What's wrong? Are you giving up? There's more waiting for you.\" Zhu Lingling laughed hysterically.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" Worried, Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu.</p><p>Qin Chu looked fine yet his heart was crying for help. However, he was determined to not show any weakness.</p><p>Especially not in front of his wife and her best friend…</p><p>\"Come on, let's go to the drop tower. I heard it's 88 meters tall, I'm excited!\" Zhu Lingling said.</p><p>\"Ms. Tigress, you're too much. I can't. I'll watch from here and take photos for you guys,\" Gao Ran begged.</p><p>Qin Chu, on the other hand, didn't say anything and just followed Huo Mian…</p><p>After they rode the drop tower, Zhu Lingling and Huo Mian were scared half-to-death. She swore that people who were prone to heart attacks would not be able to ride it because it was indeed terrifying. The feeling of being dropped from high above and losing control of gravity was exhilarating.</p><p>The good thing was, Qin Chu stuck with them until the very end. It seemed like he was okay with anything Huo Mian wanted to do.</p><p>Then, the four of them went to a Thai restaurant. While they were eating, Gao Ran suddenly asked, \"I heard you found a way for the insurance company to retract the lawsuit and let that asshole off the hook?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\" Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>\"Insurance company?\" Huo Mian looked up; she was particularly sensitive to these two words.</p><p>\"Don't tell me you don't know.\"</p><p>\"Know what?\" Huo Mian asked.</p><p>Gao Ran glanced at Qin Chu, and then at Huo Mian. He said, \"Your husband signed you up for life insurance that's worth more than ten million yuan.

Wealthy people sure know how to live,\" Zhu Lingling was flabbergasted.</p><p>\"Why would you do that? You're already loaded, do you really need an insurance company's payout?\" Huo Mian frowned, she didn't know what Qin Chu was thinking.</p><p>Gao Ran spoke before anyone else could, \"See, that's where you're wrong. Chu didn't sign you up to receive a payout from the insurance company. The point of that is if you accidentally get hurt and the offending party fails to provide a sky-high compensation, the insurance company will sue. Then, the court will rule it to be intentional and sentence the perpetrator anywhere between a couple of years to a couple of decades in prison.\"</p><p>Huo Mian and Zhu Lingling were shocked by Gao Ran's explanation…</p><p>Huo Mian finally understood why the pregnant patient's husband was detained; it was because of her insurance.</p><p>\"Which means that when you hurt your head, because your husband signed you up for high-payout insurance for that part of your body and the perpetrator couldn't pay off the 50 million yuan, he was sentenced to at least five to ten years of jail time. Plus, the insurance company will compensate you. Therefore, you'll have to be extra careful in the future, your insurance company will cry if you accidentally bump into things,\" Gao Ran said with a big smile on his face.</p><p>Huo Mian looked quietly at Qin Chu; Qin Chu, on the other hand, acted like he wasn't involved in their conversation. He was reading company emails on his phone.</p><p>Zhu Lingling gave him a thumbs up. \"China's #1 husband.\"</p><p>\"You never told me these things.\" Huo Mian pouted as if she had been wronged.</p><p>\"There are things that you don't have to know. All you need to know is that no matter who hurts you, they won't get away with it,\" Qin Chu looked up and said, enunciating each word.</p><p>\"You shouldn't be spoiling her too much, or else she might cuckold you in the future,\" Gao Ran joked.</p><p>In return, he immediately received the death stare from both Huo Mian and Qin Chu.</p><p>After dinner, they each went home. Huo Mian, after tidying up her bed and getting onto it, was still feeling out of sorts.</p><p>She couldn't believe that he signed her up for high-payout insurance.</p><p>Why were his actions so unpredictable and illogical?</p><p>While she was thinking, Qin Chu came in through the door and handed her a key.</p><p>\"Here, drive this tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Qin Chu, don't treat me so well.\"</p><p>\"You're my wife, who else am I supposed to treat well?\" Qin Chu said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\"But if you treat me too well, I might become arrogant.\"</p><p>\"Then so be it.

At a time like this, she would be raining all over Qin Chu's parade if she brought up divorce, right?</p><p>- The next morning -</p><p>After breakfast, the couple left for work together. Huo Mian's white Volkswagen CC, although nothing luxurious, was still easy on the eyes.</p><p>Plus, the model definitely attracted attention…</p><p>At an intersection, Qin Chu was supposed to make a turn, but he continued trailing Huo Mian's car.</p><p>Huo Mian took out her earphones and called Qin Chu.</p><p>\"You're driving in the wrong direction.

It was Huo Mian's first-day driving, and he was worried. That was all.</p><p>Huo Mian was originally worried that she might become the center of gossip for driving a car to work since she was only a nurse. However, her perception changed as soon as she arrived at South Side.</p><p>The other nurses were all driving luxury cars – BMWs, Land Rovers, Mercedes-Benz GLKs… Her Volkswagen was shabby compared with the other cars.</p><p>Why were the nurses so rich? The answer was obvious – most of the nurses here were young and pretty.</p><p>While they took care of the patients, most nurses became mistresses or side pieces. Some even provide 'special services' inside the hospital.</p><p>Director Wu couldn't control it, because everyone staying at South Side had hefty backgrounds. If nurses were willing to sell themselves, then the rich men were willing to buy.</p><p>It's already become a sophisticated industrial chain…</p><p>There were also nurses who were just nurses; those people perform menial labor for not much money in return.</p><p>Huo Mian was one of these nurses. After she went upstairs, she immediately reported to the head nurse.</p><p>The head nurse of South Side Recuperation Center was a thirty-or-so woman. She was young and beautiful, and, from what Huo Mian saw, her breasts were at least 36D in size.</p><p>She had a gentle voice and a pretty name – Song Lin.</p><p>She said, \"Huo Mian, I've heard about you and saw you on the news before. You saved the pregnant woman and her baby. Good for you!\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Head Nurse.\"</p><p>\"Do a good job here. Just remember that we'd rather set ourselves on fire than anger the patients here. If you keep that in mind, your salary will be high.\"</p><p>Huo Mian didn't completely understand what the head nurse meant by that…</p><p>\"Head Nurse, may I ask which department I've been assigned to?\" Huo Mian was eager to start work.</p><p>\"Orthopedics needs a hand, so you can go assist them for now.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll head over now.\"</p><p>\"Wait.\"</p><p>\"Is there anything else, Head Nurse?\"</p><p>\"A VIP patient was admitted into the Orthopedics Department yesterday. Remember to take good care of him during your shifts; you're not allowed to make any mistakes. If you piss the patient off, neither I nor Director Wu will be able to save you.\"</p><p>\"I understand and will try my best.\"</p><p>As for patients, Huo Mian always thought that she could handle anyone, as long as patients weren't purposely looking for trouble.</p><p>She understood that most patients were anxious. That was understandable because they weren't feeling well.</p><p>Therefore, Huo Mian had a lot of patiences, and she always did everything to accommodate the pregnant patients back when she worked in the OB/GYN Department.</p><p>Orthopedic patients would be easier to deal with, right?</p><p>There was a total of 10 rooms in the VIP Ortho wing, but only two patients.</p><p>Including Huo Mian, there were four nurses in total – two for day shifts, two for night shifts.</p><p>Huo Mian was working the day shift today; the other nurse was a cute girl with an adorable voice that could charm anyone.</p><p>She sounded like a little girl. Huo Mian thought she was only 18 or 19 years old, but later found out that she was already 25, even a year older than Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Hi, my name is Wang Tingting.\" The nurse who sounded like a little girl smiled.</p><p>\"Hi, Tingting, my name is Huo Mian.\"</p><p>\"I know you, you're famous. I saw you on TV a while back.\"</p><p>Huo Mian smiled awkwardly at this; being on TV for that incident wasn't anything glorious.</p><p>Because of it, her mother called her and demanded her to quit, while Zhixin kept sending her WeChat messages asking if she was okay.</p><p>Thank god it was all resolved, or else her entire family would have worried themselves to death…</p><p>\"Did the head nurse tell you that a new VIP patient was admitted into our department yesterday?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":189,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:18.21","Link":"Chapter-189","NameDisplay":"Chapter 189"},{"ID":181120949187286122,"Name":"Chapter 190: Fight","NameUnsign":"Chapter 190: Fight","Description":"<p>Chapter 190: Fight</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"She did,\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>\"You're not so experienced, so why don't you go take care of the other patient for now?

It's time for you to take your medicine.\"</p><p>\"It's rare to see a nurse who's dressed so down-to-earth,\" the old man said as he glanced at Huo Mian.</p><p>She didn't realize it until he reminded her that her uniform was different from the others.</p><p>She was wearing what she used to wear at the First Hospital. It was a conservative, baggy white gown that wasn't aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>The other nurses here, including head nurse Song Lin, were all wearing light-pink short dresses with low-cut collars.</p><p>It was like uniform fantasy…</p><p>The man's remarks reminded her that her outfit was different.</p><p>During lunch break, the head nurse brought over a uniform.</p><p>\"How are you doing? Have you gotten used to everything yet?\"</p><p>\"It's good, the patient is stable and recovering well.\"</p><p>\"That's good, here's your uniform, it's different from your old one at the First Hospital.\"</p><p>Then, the head nurse handed her a pink short dress.</p><p>\"Head Nurse… can I just wear what I have on now?\"</p><p>\"Why? Don't you like it?\"</p><p>\"It's not that. I just think the dress is a little too revealing. I don't like the style,\" Huo Mian said truthfully.</p><p>The head nurse looked at Huo Mian, her expression complicated. \"I heard that you asked the director to transfer you to South Side.\"</p><p>\"That's right.\"</p><p>\"Didn't you come here to make something of yourself? If you don't dress boldly, none of the rich men will like you,\" the head nurse decided to directly put her thoughts out there.</p><p>That's when Huo Mian realized that the head nurse misunderstood her; she thought Huo Mian was here to land a rich man.</p><p>\"I think you've misunderstood, Head Nurse. I asked to be transferred here because I needed a change of environment. I burdened my colleagues at my old post, so I didn't want to stay there anymore. But I'm only here to work, I'm not looking for rich men. Plus, I have a boyfriend.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I see. Fine, if that's the case, I'll let you be.\"</p><p>The head nurse left with the uniform after upon hearing what Huo Mian said…</p><p>During shift changes, the other two nurses came as well.</p><p>However, Huo Mian heard them fighting over who should take care of the patient in room 1.</p><p>Both of them obvisouly seemed to want to work for room 1. Huo Mian had a feeling that whoever was in that room was probably someone very important, or else Tingting wouldn't have offered to work there in the morning. The two girls working the night shift both wanted room 1 as well.</p><p>In the end, Nannan and Xiaomei played rock, paper, scissors. Nannan lost; Xiaomei was in such a good mood that she went to room 1 without even having dinner.</p><p>That night, Huo Mian prepared dinner for Qin Chu. However, as soon as she sat down on the couch to watch some TV, her phone rang, and it was South Side calling.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, come quickly, something happened in our department.\"</p><p>After hanging up, Huo Mian grabbed her coat in a hurry and headed downstairs, where she bumped into Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"Something happened at the hospital, I need to go. I made dinner, eat it while it's hot.\" Then, Huo Mian left in a hurry.</p><p>Qin Chu's gaze lingered on Huo Mian's petite figure as she slowly disappeared…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":190,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:18.733","Link":"Chapter-190","NameDisplay":"Chapter 190"},{"ID":181120949191762709,"Name":"Chapter 191: Swapped","NameUnsign":"Chapter 191: Swapped","Description":"<p>Chapter 191: Swapped</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>When Huo Mian arrived at the hospital, Xiaomei was nowhere to be found. Only the head nurse, Tingting and Nannan were there.</p><p>\"What happened? Where's Xiaomei? Isn't she working the night shift?\"</p><p>\"She's injured.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Huo Mian was surprised at what Tingting said.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, the head nurse said, \"Here's what happened. The patient in room 1 is a little hot-tempered. When Xiaomei went to draw his blood, she might've been too nervous and quivered a bit, causing the needle to move. The patient was furious and slammed a vase on Xiaomei's head. She was sent to the First Hospital's emergency room.\"</p><p>\"It was awful, I heard that she had to get seven stitches on her head. I wonder if it'll ruin her looks.\" Nannan displayed classic schadenfreude.</p><p>Tingting's lips curled, and she said in a weird tone, \"I told you the patient in room 1 wasn't easy to deal with, but you guys still fought over him. See what happened? Xiaomei's techniques weren't so good to begin with, and I can't believe she tried to draw Young Master Su's blood. She was asking for it.\"</p><p>\"But it's fine, Young Master Su is generous. As soon as the incident happened, his assistant arrived. Apparently, they're going to compensate her by the number of stitches she gets. 200,000 yuan per stitch,\" the head nurse said calmly.</p><p>Nannan and Tingting were both jealous, \"She's lucky to be able to earn 1.4 million in one night. That's enough for a Porsche. I guess Xiaomei can finally abandon that ugly BMW X1 of hers.\"</p><p>\"Wait, so you guys asked me to come because…?\" Huo Mian was already done with her shift; she didn't come all the way to the hospital at night to listen to them boast about money. She just wanted to know how she could help.</p><p>The head nurse glanced at her. \"The patient in room 1 is Su Yu, you've heard of him, right?\"</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head…</p><p>Then, the other three nurses looked at her like she was a cavewoman.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, was calm. There were a lot of important figures in the city that she didn't know. Why should she?</p><p>\"What's wrong with you? How have you not heard of Young Master Su, the son of the Su family, one of the four princes of C City? Were you from the countryside?\" Tingting was at a loss for words.</p><p>\"Yeah, Su Yu is the most famous of the four princes. Huo Siqian is second. I can't believe you don't know him, where are you from?\" Nannan looked at her mockingly.</p><p>Huo Mian wanted to say that she had no interest of getting to know that asshat Huo Siqian either, but she didn't want to bring that up.</p><p>She also didn't want the others to know her relationship with the Huo family.</p><p>\"So… So what if Su Yu's staying in room 1?\" Huo Mian asked.</p><p>\"Young Master Su is hot-tempered. He tore his ACL when he was racing. It's not a big deal, but the Su Family is taking precaution, and they brought him in last night for recovery. We're administering the most high-quality medicine, and his meals are flown over from Australia. No one can make any mistakes when taking care of him. They're still young, and their techniques are lacking. You've a lot of clinical experience back at the First Hospital, and since you were able to perform a C-section on that pregnant patient, drawing blood and administering an IV should be a piece of cake for you. That's why we've decided that you should be the one to take care of all things involving a needle.\"</p><p>Huo Mian understood what the head nurse was saying; they wanted her to do everything the others were afraid to do.</p><p>In other words, they wanted her to treat the hardest-to-treat patient. Xiaomei's head was smashed in by a vase, and she had to get seven stitches because she screwed up when drawing Young Master Su's blood.</p><p>The other nurses were too scared to go back in, so they thought of Huo Mian, the new girl.</p><p>Hearing no response from Huo Mian, the head nurse continued, \"You won't be doing it for free. I'll ask the executives to give you an additional 200 yuan per day.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, Huo Mian, please help us, or else our department will be annihilated by Young Master Su.\"</p><p>Huo Mian suddenly understood; aside from their youth and good looks, the other three nurses in her department were super inexperienced, even lacking the skill and courage to draw blood.</p><p>\"Fine, I'll do it.\"</p><p>\"Yay!\" The other two nurses let out a sigh of relief when they heard this.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, here's the IV. You can go administer it to Young Master Su.\" Tingting immediately took out a tray with an infusion set on it.</p><p>Huo Mian changed into her white robe and took the tray. Then, she walked towards room 1.</p><p>\"Head Nurse, do you think she'll be alright?\" worried, one of the nurses asked.</p><p>\"Who knows, it all depends on her luck. Even if she gets beaten up, it won't be for nothing.

They thought that Young Master Su would have pity on them because of their beauty. If they were lucky enough to receive his attention, they'll never have to be a nurse again. </p><p>Rumour has it that Su's Imperial Star Entertainment could easily lift a woman up to stardom. </p><p>Su Yu's company was home to many of the current hottest domestic celebrities. How? He tossed money at them to make them famous. </p><p>Su Yu had way too much money, so he could make anyone famous, as long as he was willing to promote them… </p><p>Forget those nurses, wherever Su Yu went, there were tons of women who wanted to pile up all over him. </p><p>He was different from Qin Chu. Qin Chu was humble, and even though everyone knew that he was the heir to GK, hardly anyone had seen this said heir. </p><p>However, Su Yu was the complete opposite. He was extravagant, loud, ill-tempered, and went through women faster than he changed out of shirts. </p><p>He wasn't just the president of an entertainment company, the Su family basically controlled the country's economy, as Su Financial Banks could be found all over the country. </p><p>His father had been ranked amongst the Forbes top five richest people in China for five consecutive years now. </p><p>When Huo Mian arrived at the door, Su Yu was on his phone. </p><p>He has been racing and playing around with car modifications since he was twelve or thirteen, and nothing had ever happened to him. </p><p>However, perhaps he was just having a bad day, so when he was racing in the mountain range, his car crashed into another, and he tore his anterior cruciate ligament. Now, he was forced to recover at South Side for a while. </p><p>Here, everyone had a different spending allowance and were arranged according to their own financial conditions.</p><p>Su Yu stayed in room one, a suite that was a hundred or so square meters in size, with a full set of appliances and furniture. Even the bed had a multi-purpose mechanical control. </p><p>He also enjoyed private Wi-Fi and had seafood flown in from Australia. His hospital bills were eight or nine hundred thousand per day, which was basically like burning money. </p><p>Four bodyguards in suits stood outside the room, and, like mummies, they didn't move at all. </p><p>Eight hours later, another group of four would take over… </p><p>Those who worked here would know that a wealthy man lived inside, while those who didn't would think that a country's leader lived inside, because it was simply too much. </p><p>This was the most high-profile man she had ever seen in her life…</p><p>She also had to go through security scanning before she stepped inside, as if she could very well be an assassin. </p><p>\"You can go in.\" </p><p>Just as Huo Mian entered, a strange flying object flew towards her. </p><p>She responded quickly, and, with a tilt of her head, she dodged it. </p><p>The thing that dropped to the floor was a space grey iPhone 6S. </p><p>\"Get lost,\" Su Yu was very upset, and, after cursing at his assistant on the phone, he shouted at whoever had entered the room without even turning around to look. </p><p>Huo Mian ignored him. She walked up, connected the tube, and then hung the infusion bag up. </p><p>\"I told you to get lost, didn't you hear me?\" </p><p>\"If all of the patients told us to leave, then who will take care of you? If you could take care of yourself, then why would you still be here? You might as well stay at a five-star hotel,\" Huo Mian said angrily. </p><p>Su Yu slightly frowned; this was the first time anyone spoke to him with this attitude. </p><p>He wanted to see what kind of nurse had guts as fat as hers. Did she not want to live anymore? Or was it some ploy to get to him? </p><p>He froze when he turned around to see Huo Mian's face. He had seen her before.</p><p>He had seen her in his WeChat friend circle and on TV, since she was the one involved in the incident a while back.</p><p>\"Aren't you that nurse who performed a C-section on that pregnant woman?\" asked Su Yu as he stared at Huo Mian. </p><p>\"That's right.\" </p><p>\"Why are you here?\" Su Yu was very surprised. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't respond. Instead, she grabbed his left hand and stabbed inside with a 'swoosh' sound while he was still dazed. </p><p>Just as Su Yu felt a slight pain, she had already finished the injection. </p><p>\"Who told you to poke me with a needle?\" Su Yu was infuriated. </p><p>\"Don't move around, it will be bad if the needle moves,\" warned Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Take it off, I don't want any needles,\" annoyed, Su Yu raised his hand to take out the needle. </p><p>Then, Huo Mian crossed both of her arms, looked at him, and said, \"If you're not afraid of me piercing you again, then go ahead and take it out. I'm not the one who has to get stabbed again.\" </p><p>Su Yu immediately stopped. He raised his head, and looked at Huo Mian with a pissed-off face, \"Do you know who you're talking to?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":192,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:19.667","Link":"Chapter-192","NameDisplay":"Chapter 192"},{"ID":181120949203301946,"Name":"Chapter 193: Brutality","NameUnsign":"Chapter 193: Brutality","Description":"<p>Chapter 193: Brutality</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian didn't care about what he said. Instead, she took out a pen from her white robe, held up his file and said, \"Mr. Su Yu, right? You'll be administered two rounds of IV tonight, and I'll take blood samples tomorrow morning. The blood sample needs to be taken on an empty stomach, so don't eat anything after 8 PM tonight, but you're welcome to drink water.\" </p><p>After Huo Mian spoke, she turned around to head out… </p><p>\"Damn it, come back.\" Before Su Yu could even finish his words, Huo Mian had already left… </p><p>This was the first time in his entire life that anyone had ever treated his words like garbage. </p><p>No matter what he said, or how angry he was, Huo Mian completely ignored his presence. </p><p>\"Hey, did you all die out there? Someone get the hell in,\" said Su Yu, with a belly full of fury. </p><p>A bodyguard immediately ran inside. \"Young Master, what's wrong?\" </p><p>\"Are you blind? Pick the phone up from the ground. I want to file a complaint. The nurses in this hospital are terrible.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" The bodyguard slouched over to pick up the phone and handed it to him. </p><p>Su Yu picked it up and saw that the screen had cracked, so he could no longer make any calls. </p><p>\"Give me your phone.\" </p><p>\"My phone is charging,\" replied the bodyguard honestly. </p><p>\"Get lost, HURRY UP AND GET THE F*CK OUT!\" Su Yu grew more frustrated at the sight of these dummies. </p><p>The head nurse and the two little nurses were all slightly shocked to see Huo Mian walk out unharmed. </p><p>\"Are you okay, Huo Mian?\" </p><p>\"I'm fine.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>\"Did… Young Master Su lash out?\" </p><p>\"I didn't pay attention to his state, I left right after I administered his IV.\" </p><p>\"Wasn't he pissed off?\" asked Tingting curiously. </p><p>Huo Mian shook her head. \"I'm not sure, I didn't pay much attention.\" </p><p>\"Not bad, good work.\" The head nurse patted Huo Mian's shoulders. </p><p>\"Head Nurse, I'll be off now, I'll be back tomorrow morning to draw his blood.\"</p><p>\"Okay, drive safely.\" </p><p>After Huo Mian left, Tingting assumed that Su Yu calmed down quite a bit, so she pulled down the collars on her nurse uniform. </p><p>Then, she went inside again to deliver dinner, her hips swaying as she walked. </p><p>However, no more than a minute in, she was once again chased away by Su Yu. </p><p>The dishes spilled all over the floor, and Su Yu was just infuriated by how stupid these nurses were. </p><p>They couldn't even do the smallest things right. The idiot that tried to draw his blood earlier tonight shook as soon as he stared at his arm. His glare terrified the nurse, so her hand shook, putting him in great pain. The nurses, on the other hand, blamed it on his temper. </p><p>However, the nurse that just injected him was quite skilled and didn't hurt him at all. </p><p>After the news that Su Yu made a scene by tossing over the dishes in anger had gotten out, Mrs. Su and the housemaid came over with food in less than an hour. </p><p>She was worried that her son had been treated badly, and so, she made sure to put the head nurse in her place afterward, and Song Lin didn't dare to talk back.</p><p>After Mrs. Su left, many women came by to visit Su Yu, one after another, models and superstars. </p><p>There were even socialites and famous television hosts. </p><p>They all came over to visit Su Yu. Everyone brought over food they made themselves or ordered from restaurants. </p><p>When Huo Mian got back home, Qin Chu hadn't eaten yet. Instead, he was on the sofa watching the financial news. </p><p>\"Why haven't you eaten yet?\" </p><p>\"Let's eat together.\" </p><p>Huo Mian felt somewhat comforted by this, as she took off her jacket, washed her hands, and sat down with him on the dinner table. </p><p>\"How was work today?\" Qin Chu asked nonchalantly. </p><p>\"Not bad.\" </p><p>\"But I've heard it's pretty difficult to work at South Side Recuperation Center. Many nurses have been injured for unknown reasons.\" </p><p>It seemed like nothing could escape Qin Chu… </p><p>\"Uhm… Those were all accidents.\" </p><p>\"Protect yourself.\" </p><p>\"I know, you did place a heavy insurance on me after all,\" added Huo Mian. </p><p>Qin Chu couldn't help but raise the corners of his mouth, \"I'm glad you remember.\" </p><p>\"You're busy at the company, so don't worry about me all the time. I'm a grown-up, I'll be fine.\" </p><p>\"Do you think I'll believe you?\" Qin Chu didn't believe that Huo Mian could take care of herself, or else she wouldn't have been blackmailed by others and became a public enemy on the Internet. If Qin Chu didn't intervene, who knew what would've happened to her?</p><p>\"Uhm… fine.\" Huo Mian knew that she wasn't convincing at all.</p><p>\"Right, let's buy a car for your brother.

He would often wake up in the middle of the night and would only be able to return to sleep after a few cigarettes. </p><p>However, after he began to share a bed with Huo Mian, he was able to sleep like a baby. </p><p>It was probably because he felt comforted and calmed by Huo Mian's pleasant body scent. </p><p>He wouldn't want to wake up, even if the world was about to collapse.</p><p>Both of them went to work in the morning, and Huo Mian drove very carefully, in fear that she would scratch the car. </p><p>After she arrived at the hospital, she hurriedly changed into her uniform and prepared to draw blood for the patient in room 1. </p><p>\"Be careful, Huo Mian,\" the head nurse warned. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded and entered the room with the blood-drawing kit. </p><p>Su Yu was in the middle of a video conference. He leaned his head against the side of the bed and spoke seriously into the other end. </p><p>Huo Mian walked over without a care and held up Su Yu's arm. </p><p>Suddenly, Su Yu took back his arm, \"Who told you to touch me?\" </p><p>\"I told you yesterday that I'll be over for blood samples today.\" </p><p>\"Get out, I don't want to,\" said Su Yu coldly. </p><p>\"Okay, you don't have to, you'll only be here for another month at worst.\" </p><p>\"Wait, come back,\" Su Yu yelled as he put down the laptop, noticing that Huo Mian was about to leave. </p><p>Huo Mian stopped in her tracks and turned around… </p><p>\"What did you mean?\" </p><p>\"It's very clear that you won't cooperate with our course of treatment, so your recovery will definitely be slower than others. There's nothing wrong with that, I'm not the one living here and paying the bills, you've got the money to stay here for as long as you want to.\" </p><p>Su Yu's temper immediately rose up when he heard what she said, but after a few thoughts, he coldly ordered, \"Come back and draw my blood.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's lips curled and slowly walked over. </p><p>\"You better be careful, if you do it wrong, you'll end up like that nurse.\" </p><p>\"I'm okay with ending up like her, I hear she got 1.4 million yuan in compensation. If you give me a million or so in compensation, I promise that I'll prick you even harder than she did.\" </p><p>\"You…!\" Su Yu was so angry that for the first time ever, he didn't know what to say. </p><p>\"Huh? Why are you mad? Did I say anything wrong? She put you in pain, but you still gave her 1.4 million. Aren't you just paying to be in pain?\" </p><p>\"Damn it, you'll regret offending me,\" warned Su Yu. </p><p>\"Has anyone ever told you it's best not to offend hospital staff, especially during your stay? You'll be doomed if any medical accidents were to happen to you.\" </p><p>\"How dare you? If so, you'll die a nasty death.\" </p><p>\"What's wrong with that?

His bad temper was widely known by those around him. </p><p>Ever since he was a little kid, others have embraced him like the moon in the sky, and not even his parents had ever spoken loudly to him. </p><p>The friends he made respected him greatly and paraded him as the leader of their group. No one ever dared to rebut him, no matter what kind of decisions he made. </p><p>Later on, the various women he met were even bigger suck-ups. They were basically willing to kneel down and lick his shoes. </p><p>However, he knew that all of these people only did so because of his family fame, and the power that name wielded. </p><p>As the sole heir of the Su Family, Su Yu was regarded as a rare treasure. </p><p>His grandfather, the military chief, also spoiled him rotten. </p><p>His grandpa has once said, \"Yu, grandpa will always support any decisions you make, as long as it's not anything that harms society or challenges ethical standards.\" </p><p>Due to his arrogant temper as a young kid, he was sent to the military. </p><p>He graduated with the highest distinction in his platoon, but just as he was about to be promoted to regiment commander, he suddenly announced a change of career. </p><p>After the transition, he wanted to open a business for fun but refused to deal with the family bank, and so his dad provided him with a small business investment of 500,000,000 yuan.</p><p>Within the short five years, Imperial Star Entertainment quickly rose up as a major player in the domestic entertainment industry. </p><p>The company paved the way for many well-known celebrities, and just last year, signed the popular actress, Miss Annie Liang, with an 8,000,000 yuan contract. </p><p>Imperial Star Entertainment's stocks have also increased at a great pace, with a profit of one billion in a single quarter. </p><p>The movies they've produced all set box office records, and so it was undeniable that Su Yu was an exceptionally talented businessman. </p><p>Everyone in the Su Family spoiled this precious boy rotten… </p><p>He picked women like they were flowers from a field and was seen with several girls each month. </p><p>From actresses to models, from socialites to T.V. hosts, these women come from various fields and all wanted to be by his side. </p><p>None of them dared to even think about becoming Mrs. Su, but they were all quite happy to be just his lover, because even that would provide them with unlimited prestige and wealth. </p><p>Apparently, Young Master Su was a big spender, and his catchphrase was, \"Issues that can be solved with money are not issues.\" </p><p>Anyways, he had plenty of money to throw around. </p><p>He was truly a golden boy, who got tormented by an unknown little nurse on the second day he settled into South Side Recuperation Center. </p><p>He was even called immature; Su Yu had enough, so he told his bodyguards to ban Huo Mian from his room. </p><p>After Huo Mian successfully took Su Yu's blood sample, she headed over to room 2 to take care of the older patient. </p><p>The grandpa looked quite well, as he sat on the bed and played Chinese chess alone. </p><p>Huo Mian smiled, \"Grandpa, aren't you bored by yourself?\" </p><p>\"It won't make a difference to me. These days, youngsters wouldn't know how to play this game. You kids only know online games and smartphone games. That grandson of mine plays that plants versus corpses game on his phone all the time.\" </p><p>\"Haha, it's plants versus zombies,\" Huo Mian laughed, as she found the grandpa quite adorable. </p><p>\"I don't know what he's fighting against, but thanks to technological advancement, these traditional games gradually lost its edge.\" He sighed.</p><p>Huo Mian walked over, looked at the chessboard, and moved one of the knights.</p><p>The old man raised his head in slight surprise, \"You know Chinese chess?\" </p><p>\"A bit.\" Huo Mian slightly smiled. </p><p>\"Come, child, sit down and play a few rounds with me,\" said the grandpa in excitement. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't refuse. She sat down across from the old man and put herself into the game. </p><p>After three rounds, the grandpa's face grew dull, \"You were lying kiddo, what did you mean by 'a bit'? You're clearly a Chinese chess expert.\" </p><p>Huo Mian won two of the three rounds, and the final round was a tie, only because Huo Mian tried to save the grandpa's dignity. However, it was obvious to the old man, given his experience and age. </p><p>Huo Mian awkwardly smiled, because she really wasn't some expert. When she was young, she used to watch Uncle Jing teach Zhixing how to play, and oddly found her way through since. She hadn't played over these years, but she felt familiar as soon as she touched the chess board.</p><p>\"Come on, that didn't count. Let's play some more.\" Addicted, the old man wanted to keep playing.</p><p>Just then, the head nurse knocked, \"Huo Mian, come out for a second.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":195,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:21.327","Link":"Chapter-195","NameDisplay":"Chapter 195"},{"ID":18112094921759834,"Name":"Chapter 196: Brainstorm","NameUnsign":"Chapter 196: Brainstorm","Description":"<p>Chapter 196: Brainstorm</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian slowly stood up. </p><p>\"Grandpa, I'm going to head out for a bit. It will be your nap time soon so don't forget to take your hypertension pills before going to sleep.\" </p><p>\"I know, come back if you're free in the afternoon. Let's continue playing.\" The grandpa was acting like a kid full of anticipation. </p><p>Huo Mian smiled gently. \"Sure.\"</p><p>As she stepped out, Huo Mian saw that the head nurse looked somewhat odd, \"What's wrong, Head Nurse?\" </p><p>\"When Tingting went in to clean up Su's room, she heard those bodyguards say that Su Yu banned you from entering his room. There's still an injection tonight. If you don't go, I'm really worried that Tingting might mess up. Xiaomei has already made a mistake, and if we upset Su again, we might all be fired.\" </p><p>\"Oh, that's what it's about.\" Huo Mian was extremely calm. </p><p>\"How is this not a big issue? The fate of our careers depends on this. You don't know this, Huo Mian, but I began working here when I was 28, and I'm 34 now. I was only promoted to head nurse after six years of hard work. With all of my monthly benefits included, I only get about forty thousand or so. I still have to pay the mortgage for my home and car, and I have a baby to feed, I can't lose this job.\" </p><p>Song Lin was telling the truth, not complaining about how poor she was. This job was truly very important to her. </p><p>Even though she hadn't always been proper with what she wore, she had a decent reputation in the hospital.</p><p>She had never been involved with too many patient conflicts, and more importantly, she had been married for a while and even had a child. </p><p>Her husband was only an average employee, but they had to spend quite a lot of money on their sick, premature daughter. </p><p>It was hard for her to provide for her family, and Huo Mian had heard about this from a casual conversation with Tingting. </p><p>Therefore, there was no need to suspect the validity of the head nurse's words...</p><p>\"Don't worry, Head Nurse, I won't let him fire us.\" </p><p>\"But you're not allowed to go in, and Tingting and Nannan's techniques aren't good enough. I know them too well.\" </p><p>The head nurse had been here for four years and saw plenty of VIP patients. Most of the time, the nurses could get away with things like this just by being a little flirty, but Su Yu was extremely difficult to care for because he didn't care about anything. </p><p>\"Then… I'll think of something, anyway, don't worry about this,\" Huo Mian was confident.</p><p>The head nurse was still worried, even if Huo Mian promised again and again that everything would be fine. She had been troubled and anxious all morning. </p><p>When the shifts changed at night, Tingting got off work, but before she did, she intentionally warned Huo Mian, \"Don't mess up the injection tonight.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>At 6 PM, Huo Mian walked towards room 1 with the infusion set. </p><p>\"Stop, you can't go in.\" </p><p>\"Why not?\" asked Huo Mian in response. </p><p>\"Young Master Su said that you can't enter this room,\" the four bodyguards all said at the same time. </p><p>Huo Mian looked at their conservative faces and said, \"It's fine if you don't let me in, but if your Young Master doesn't receive proper treatment, then his recovery time will be prolonged. By then, it will affect his condition, and if anyone asks, I'll say that you guys blocked me from entering to give him his injections.\" </p><p>\"Then find someone else to do the injection. Mr. Su has given direct orders to ban you from entering,\" one of the bodyguards said stubbornly.  </p><p>\"If someone else could do it better, then why I would be here? Do you think that I wanted to come? Don't you know that he has a really bad temper? The other nurses were too scared to come; they were all scared of upsetting him, but I think that my skills are good enough. So, if you continue to stop me, then you'll have to take responsibility for whatever happens.\" </p><p>The four bodyguards looked at each other after Huo Mian said this, indecisive. </p><p>\"Move aside, I have to go in now, I can't miss the injection time… unless you guys are willing to take responsibility for any consequences?\" Before the bodyguards could say anything else, Huo Mian pushed through door and went in.</p><p>She brainwashed the bodyguards with only a few words; she was indeed intelligent. </p><p>Su Yu had a mini surveillance display inside and could see everything that happened outside. </p><p>He originally thought that Huo Mian would step away when she was refused entry, but to his surprise, she was able to confuse the bodyguards with no more than a few words.</p><p>When Huo Mian walked inside, Su Yu turned off the surveillance. </p><p>\"Give me your hand, it's time for your injection.\" Huo Mian didn't want to waste another word with him.</p><p>Su Yu stared at Huo Mian. \"You sure have a way with words, why didn't you become a sales instructor? Being a nurse is a waste of your talents.\"</p><p>\"Can I take that as a compliment? Are you calling me a genius?\" Huo Mian looked at him and asked in response.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":196,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:21.76","Link":"Chapter-196","NameDisplay":"Chapter 196"},{"ID":181120949222291008,"Name":"Chapter 197: Professional","NameUnsign":"Chapter 197: Professional","Description":"<p>Chapter 197: Professional</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I wouldn't go as far as saying that you're a genius, it is more like my bodyguards are as dumb as pigs.\" </p><p>Huo Mian broke out in laughter, and Su Yu looked at the cute dimples that appeared on her smiling face. </p><p>She wasn't like those other women out there; their smiles were so fake, either covering their mouth with their hands to seem ladylike or smiling softly as if they were being photographed. It was very difficult to find someone like her who had such a natural and beautiful smile. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't say anything else. She hung up the IV drip and prepared to insert the needle. </p><p>\"Just saying… I didn't spend so much money here to endure all this agony. Can't you just use a retention needle? I don't like that you're poking me every day. Are you trying to make me die from the pain?\" Su Yu reprimanded with a cold face. </p><p>Huo Mian lifted her head to look at him, saying seriously, \"People like you who lack common sense are the scariest. Retention needles are convenient, preventing the need to repeatedly insert needles, but because of how long they are left inside, it's very easy to breed bacterial infections, which can cause significant damage to the blood vessels. Under normal circumstances, unless the patient is a wildly moving infant where there's a risk of swelling, we wouldn't recommend using it.\" </p><p>\"You seem quite professional,\" Su Yu muttered to himself. </p><p>\"Of course. If I wasn't, would I be sent to give you IVs? Do you think this is a great thing? Do you think I want to do this crap?\" As she was talking, Huo Mian had already inserted the needle. </p><p>She finished her job whenever Su Yu wasn't paying attention. In reality, it didn't hurt that much, it was just like being bitten by a mosquito. </p><p>This Young Master Su was just too dainty, and because he wasn't allowed to go out and have fun, he spent every day in the clinic b*tching about every little thing. </p><p>\"From what I heard, it seems like you don't want to take care of me?\" </p><p>\"Of course I don't,\" Huo Mian raised her head and responded as she watched the movement of the IV fluid. </p><p>\"Well, did you know that by taking care of me, you earn an additional 2000 yuan every day?\" Su Yu asked. </p><p>Huo Mian froze and shook her head. \"Now, that I didn't know.\" </p><p>Now she finally understood why at first everyone fought to come to room 1. Not only could they be close to Mr. Su, they could also earn extra pay every day. It was definitely a good deal. </p><p>\"How about now? Do you still not want to be here?\" </p><p>\"Don't want to be here.\"</p><p>Su Yu thought that Huo Mian would beg to take care of him. </p><p>\"Why not?\" </p><p>\"Because taking care of you is so boring, even the old man next door is better. At least I can have tea and play chess with him. Okay, there's nothing else wrong with you, another nurse will come to remove the needle later. Try not to fall asleep during this time, and watch over your IV.\" </p><p>Finishing her spiel, Huo Mian put both her hands in the pockets of her white uniform, and sauntered out. </p><p>Su Yu was left behind feeling conflicted. How could there be such an annoying woman in this world? She's so unappreciative.</p><p>How dare she say that taking care of him was less appealing than the old man next door? </p><p>Tomorrow, he had to find out who the old man next door was, and get rid of him as soon as possible. </p><p>Because Huo Mian's shifts for the week were all during the day, she was able to go home early. </p><p>Mei was hospitalized due to the accident, so all her shifts were being temporarily covered by the head nurse herself. </p><p>As Huo Mian was leaving work, she bumped into the night shift nurse, Nannan. </p><p>She drove a white BMW X3, a pretty cool car for a girl. </p><p>She glanced at Huo Mian's car and smiled, \"This car isn't really that cheap too, why didn't you buy a brand name instead? Not many people will cast a second look at a Volkswagen.\" </p><p>\"Ah, this is my family's, I didn't buy it,\" Huo Mian explained. </p><p>Nannan didn't say any more. She slowly parked her car and headed towards the entrance.</p><p>Due to rush hour traffic, it was 6:30 PM by the time Huo Mian got home. </p><p>Qin Chu hadn't returned yet, so the house appeared lonely. She opened the fridge and sadly found that other than some bread and milk, there was nothing she could use to cook with. </p><p>As she was preparing to go to the supermarket, she received a call from Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Change into something more formal, I'll be home to pick you up in 10 minutes.\" </p><p>Not waiting for Huo Mian's reply, he hung up.</p><p>Change into formal wear?

His wife didn't usually dress up, but when she did, she definitely didn't lose to those actresses or models on TV. </p><p>Furthermore, Huo Mian exerted this aura that normal people didn't have. </p><p>On the passenger seat, Huo Mian warily asked, \"Where are we going?\" </p><p>\"To eat.\" </p><p>\"Um… Is there some special occasion today?\" Huo Mian suddenly asked. </p><p>Qin Chu turned his head to glance at her, and, after a moment of hesitation, finally said in a disappointed tone, \"No.\" </p><p>No more words were spoken before they arrived at the rotating restaurant atop the Pullman Hotel. </p><p>You could see the night view of the whole city from up there, and the rumor was that the head chef here had trained in a Michelin-Star restaurant and was specialized in making Western dishes and desserts. </p><p>It was really difficult to reserve a spot here. The restaurant only served 6 tables per night and only 2 people per table. </p><p>Qin Chu and Huo Mian sat at the table with the best view, and the atmosphere in the restaurant is exceptionally romantic. </p><p>Every corner of the floor was filled with roses, and there was even a handsome caucasian man playing the violin for them. </p><p>\"It's so pretty here, I didn't know that a place like this existed in C City,\" Huo Mian exclaimed. </p><p>Just then, Qin Chu pulled out a small, delicate ornamental box from god knows where, and pushed it across the table, \"This is for you.\" </p><p>\"What?\" </p><p>\"Open it, and you'll see.\" Qin Chu was purposefully vague. </p><p>Huo Mian grabbed the box, opening it slowly to reveal a diamond ring inside. </p><p>\"Are you… proposing?\" Seeing the ring, Huo Mian raised her head to ask Qin Chu. </p><p>\"No, I just think it suits you.\" </p><p>Huo Mian slid the ring onto her finger, and it was beautiful, not to mention how perfectly it fit. Most importantly, it was a style that she liked - very small, inconspicuous, and not at all over the top. </p><p>Qin Chu's present was proof of how well he knew her. He would never buy her a Golden Egg to show off his wealth. </p><p>\"It's beautiful, thank you,\" After putting it on, Huo Mian didn't want to take it off, waving her hand about.  </p><p>Qin Chu smiled. It looked like his efforts in designing this ring himself had not been wasted. </p><p>He picked the diamond personally, then sent it overseas to manufacture before finally flying it back.</p><p>He spent more than 3 million yuan on this gift, but of course, Huo Mian didn't need to know that. </p><p>She thought that it was something that you could buy in stores, like a normal ring worth around 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. </p><p>At that moment, the servers began to bring out the food: a medium-well steak, foie gras, caviar, and Australian lobster. </p><p>And a clearly expensive bottle of red wine. </p><p>Huo Mian thought about the date in her head, it wasn't her birthday today, nor Qin Chu's… </p><p>But this atmosphere… </p><p>Qin Chu silently poured two glasses of red wine, handing one to Huo Mian. </p><p>Then, he lifted his own glass and said, \"Happy Anniversary.\" </p><p>Huo Mian paused. Anniversary? Suddenly remembering, she said apologetically, \"Sorry, I forgot that it is our 100th day wedding anniversary today.\" </p><p>That's right, it was the beginning of summer when they had gotten their wedding certificate, and it was already the end of summer, meaning that an entire three months had gone by. </p><p>\"No worries, it's fine as long as I remember.\" Qin Chu raised his glass and took a small sip. </p><p>Huo Mian also raised her glass and took a sip, it would be impossible to ever forget a scene like this, at such a beautiful restaurant on a special day like this, with such a special person.</p><p>\"You even prepared a gift, but I don't have anything for you.\" Huo Mian felt a bit awkward. </p><p>If she had known, she would've bought him something… </p><p>\"If you're serious about giving me a gift, why don't you give me a kiss. It'll make me very happy,\" Qin Chu said in all seriousness. </p><p>Huo Mian's face reddened… </p><p>Yet she still rose gracefully, walking to Qin Chu's side, and aiming to kiss his cheek. </p><p>Right as her lips were about to touch his cheek, Qin Chu suddenly turned his face, meeting her lips with his.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately panicked… This as*face!</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":198,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:22.687","Link":"Chapter-198","NameDisplay":"Chapter 198"},{"ID":181120949231537770,"Name":"Chapter 199: Rumors","NameUnsign":"Chapter 199: Rumors","Description":"<p>Chapter 199: Rumors</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Without giving it too much thought, Huo Mian immediately returned to her seat, beginning to eat while pretending that nothing had happened. </p><p>Even when they had moved onto dessert, she focused on eating each scoop of ice cream at a time, not daring to raise her head… </p><p>Qin Chu looked at her cowardly response; the corners of his mouth raised in a smile, his gaze becoming incomparably warm. </p><p>When they got home and were getting ready for bed, Qin Chu received a call after taking a shower.  </p><p>\"I have to go out for a moment, you should sleep first.\" </p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Feeling that it was something serious, Huo Mian asked worriedly. </p><p>\"My dad was hospitalized due to high blood pressure.\" </p><p>\"Is it serious?\" </p><p>\"I don't know yet, so I'm going to go take a look.

Therefore, she had no choice but to swallow her words.</p><p>The weird thing was, now that Qin Chu wasn't home, she couldn't fall asleep. </p><p>Maybe she had gotten used to him being there beside her when they slept, and now that she was suddenly alone, she was feeling a bit uncomfortable. </p><p>That's why, sometimes, a habit can become something scary. </p><p>It's fine not being able to get certain things in life. What's scarier is losing something you have. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't get much sleep that night, and when she woke up in the morning, she found that Qin Chu still hadn't returned. </p><p>She thought for a moment, then sent him a WeChat message, \"How's your dad?\" </p><p>\"He's fine now. His blood pressure decreased and he went home already. I have an early meeting at the company so I had to leave. Remember to eat breakfast.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" After replying, Huo Mian washed up and left after drinking a glass of milk. </p><p>On the road, she unconsciously turned on the radio in the car and heard a piece of news.</p><p>\"According to media outlets, yesterday, at the rooftop restaurant of the Pullman Hotel, the celebrity famed for her portrayal of feudal era dramas, Luo Feifei, went on a date with the prince of the GK Corporation. Paparazzi have pictures from the scene, and rumor has it that Luo Feifei is the celebrity face for a female shoe brand under GK, so everyone believes that she took advantage of this working opportunity to seduce the prince. According to employees at the restaurant, the two enjoyed a sweet dinner. Has their relationship been exposed?\" </p><p>Upon hearing this, Huo Mian laughed to herself. When did she become Luo Feifei, the celebrity? Did they look similar? </p><p>Taking out her phone, she searched her up and found that they didn't look alike at all. She wondered how the media could've mixed them up. </p><p>But what Huo Mian didn't know was that last night, Luo Feifei had actually gone to that restaurant; but instead of Qin Chu, she went with her personal assistant. But the media loved to assume, and upon noticing Qin Chu's car and the fact that Luo Feifei was GK's new spokesperson, they connected the two together. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't bother paying attention to these random pieces of news and drove to South Side Recuperation Center. </p><p>On the other hand, when Qin Chu left the conference room at his company, he appeared to be exhausted. </p><p>Yesterday, he spent an entire night looking after his father at the hospital and drove him home early the next morning. </p><p>After an entire night without sleep, of course he would look frail. </p><p>\"Boss, here's your coffee.\" Yang immediately handed it over. </p><p>Qin Chu took it and slowly took a sip… </p><p>\"Boss… have you seen today's newspaper?\" </p><p>\"Not yet, why?\" </p><p>\"Um… maybe you should take a look at it.\" </p><p>Qin Chu picked up the morning newspaper, glanced it over, and saw the giant entertainment headlines that read, \"Celebrity Luo Feifei's midnight date with GK's prince, relationship exposed?\" </p><p>After reading the news, Qin Chu's expression darkened… </p><p>\"So, Boss, did you really go to the Pullman for dinner last night?\" Yang asked hesitantly because the Maybach in the photos was indeed the one owned by his boss. Did his boss suddenly start dating celebrities? </p><p>\"Yeah, I did.\" </p><p>\"So you mean…\" Yang looked hesitantly at the president, feeling as if he was admitting to the relationship.</p><p>\"So, who the heck is Luo Feifei?\" Qin Chu asked with a grim face.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":199,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:23.153","Link":"Chapter-199","NameDisplay":"Chapter 199"},{"ID":181120949236306308,"Name":"Chapter 200: Advance","NameUnsign":"Chapter 200: Advance","Description":"<p>Chapter 200: Advance</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Wait, boss, you don't know Luo Feifei?

You can use this opportunity to promote the movie that you're starring in that's scheduled for release next month.\" </p><p>Luo Feifei looked at herself in the compact mirror and smiled. </p><p>This rumor was one that she had never thought of, the meal at the Pullman was something she had gotten her assistant to reserve a month in advance. </p><p>She never thought that GK's prince would be there too, and she really regretted not recognizing him at the restaurant. </p><p>It would've been a great opportunity to suck up to him, but surprisingly, the media's irritating assumptions was a great help to her this time.</p><p>Maybe she could take this opportunity and actually begin dating GK's prince. After all, marrying into a rich family was every female celebrity's dream. </p><p>In front of the camera, Luo Feifei smiled sweetly, passionately answering the reporters' questions. </p><p>Finally, a reporter asked, \"Miss Luo Feifei, can you tell us about your meal with GK's prince last night? Are you guys announcing your relationship?\" </p><p>Luo Feifei pretended to be a little shy as she said, \"About that, I'm not able to divulge any information right now, but if there's any good news, I'll be sure to share it with everyone.\" </p><p>Luo Feifei's answer was so vague that it drew more attention to the subject. </p><p>Another reporter then asked, \"Word is that you're the new spokesperson for GK's OWQ female shoe brand. Did you get this opportunity because you're dating the prince, or did you only start dating after landing this role?\" </p><p>\"Sorry, can everyone please ask questions about next month's movie only? Thank you.\" Her agent appeared at that moment to fend off the question. </p><p>Luo Feifei did what she did so she could prolong the spotlight that had been casted on her, taking this opportunity to increase her popularity. </p><p>She believed herself to be young and beautiful, so even if GK's president saw the report, he wouldn't blame her. </p><p>Maybe he would even invite her out to eat. Anyways, Luo Feifei began fantasizing about everything.</p><p>After the interview was broadcasted, it gathered over 10 million hits, as a lot of people became interested in GK's mysterious prince. </p><p>As a result of his rumored relationship with Luo Feifei, everyone's curiosity towards Qin Chu grew.</p><p>GK's stocks also skyrocketed that day… </p><p>After Mrs. Qin saw the news, she couldn't sit still any longer and immediately phoned her son. </p><p>But she couldn't get through, as Qin Chu put his phone on automatic voicemail since too many people were bothering him. </p><p>Even Gao Ran sent a WeChat message to Qin Chu, \"Bro, what's going on? Aren't you afraid that Huo Mian will make you kneel on a durian when you get home?\"</p><p>In reality, Huo Mian had already heard about it, but she was aware of the truth, and thus didn't care. </p><p>- GK Design Department - </p><p>Jiang Linyue's face dropped after watching the report. </p><p>\"Director, say, do you think our president is really dating Luo Feifei?\" </p><p>\"Do you think that trash like Luo Feifei can match up to our president? What a joke. Let me tell you, no woman in the entertainment industryis clean. Our president would probably find her dirty since he's germaphobic.\" Because Jiang Linyue idolized Qin Chu, she was well informed of all his habits. She had managed her loneliness for all these years and maintained her virginity, all so that Qin Chu would take notice of her. </p><p>- The President's Office -</p><p>\"Sir, this is getting out of hand! Should we get the PR Department to make a statement?\" Yang carefully asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":200,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:23.63","Link":"Chapter-200","NameDisplay":"Chapter 200"},{"ID":181120949248916625,"Name":"Chapter 201: Shunned","NameUnsign":"Chapter 201: Shunned","Description":"<p>Chapter 201: Shunned</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Chapter 201 - Shunned</p><p>\"Why do I have to respond to something like this?\"</p><p>\"But Ms. Luo Feifei is the newest spokesperson for our line of female footwear this season.\" Assistant Yang looked like he was about to cry.</p><p>The chairman of the board couldn't find the president and, therefore, called again and again.

GK breached our contract, and you can't be their spokesperson anymore.\" Her manager hurried into the changing room.</p><p>Luo Feifei stood up immediately upon hearing what her manager said, \"What did you say?\"</p><p>\"They want someone else.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Luo Feifei's expression went grim.</p><p>\"I don't know the specifics, but they already called to tell me they're willing to pay the penalty, and that you can't be their spokesperson anymore. Do you know how popular that product is? Whoever is its spokesperson will get a huge boost in popularity.

I want to be GK's spokesperson,\" Luo Feifei said stubbornly.</p><p>\"It's not like I can do anything about it… Do you think what you said this morning at the press conference pissed President Qin off?\"</p><p>\"I don't think so…\" Luo Feifei was unsure as well.</p><p>\"Also, I heard that…\" Her manager hesitated.</p><p>\"What did you hear?\"</p><p>\"I heard that their president announced that from now on, GK will not be using you as the spokesperson for any of their products.\"</p><p>After Luo Feifei heard this, she immediately fell back into her chair, dumbstruck.</p><p>\"This can't happen!

Top-tier celebrities in China have all been GK's spokespersons, I can't miss out on an opportunity like this. If they really block me out of everything, my future will be in jeopardy,\" Luo Feifei said as she shivered, realizing the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>The rims of her eyes turned red…</p><p>Her manager was a little angry and annoyed, and thought, should've, would've, could've, what were you thinking?

I just wanted to talk to you.\"</p><p>Qin Chu looked at her, a little bewildered…</p><p>The truth was, he didn't recognize that it was Luo Feifei.

As long as you're willing to forgive me, I'll agree to whatever you ask me to do in the future.\" Luo Feifei looked at Qin Chu's gorgeous face and implied that he could have his way with her. </p><p>Too bad Qin Chu wasn't interested at all…</p><p>All he said was, \"We will be hiring a European or American celebrity to be our new spokesperson.

Of course, she never had pig food before, but it was an educated guess.</p><p>To save time, Huo Mian made kimbap, which was a Korean-style of sushi. She also bought a jar of kimchi when she passed by the grocery store.</p><p>It was a perfect combination…</p><p>After spending her morning taking care of the patient in room 2, she brought her lunchbox out to the bench in the hall. She was just getting ready to dig in when Su Yu, who had just finished his post-rehab session, walked out from the other end of the hall with the help of his bodyguards.</p><p>Right away he knew that it was Huo Mian. Not because she was insanely beautiful; rather, it was because she was the only nurse who wore a baggy white uniform. The other nurses all wore short dresses, so that had to be her.</p><p>Ever since Su Yu was admitted, he had experienced a loss of appetite. He didn't like any of the food brought to him – seafood, stir-fry, dessert, or anything else.</p><p>Being stuck in bed all day irritated him so much that it spoiled his appetite.</p><p>A few of the female celebrities that belonged to his company were good at cooking and brought him home-cooked meals now and then, but Su Yu just threw everything in the trash.</p><p>However, just then, he saw Huo Mian sitting there, enjoying her lunch.

She wasn't sure why the chairman's wife invited her to their home.</p><p>This was her first time visiting the Qin Manor, it was indeed luxurious and filled with grandeur.</p><p>The maid cut up some fruit and poured her a cup of scented tea. Qin Chu's mother came down from the second floor, looking elegant and poised.</p><p>\"Mrs. Qin.\" Jiang Linyue immediately got up to greet her.</p><p>\"Sit down.\"</p><p>Behaving a bit reserved, Jiang Linyue sat back down, and Mrs. Qin sat down on the leather couch beside her.</p><p>\"Don't be nervous, I didn't ask you here to discuss company matters. I wanted to talk to you about something personal. The chairman isn't home, so you can relax.\"</p><p>\"Okay, Mrs. Qin,\" Jiang Linyue smiled.</p><p>She was wearing a beige suit with black heels and stockings. Her makeup was applied delicately.</p><p>Jiang Linyue was one of the prettiest girls at GK and had many suitors. However, she was too proud to date any of them.</p><p>She never paid much attention to those men, since she always felt that she should be with Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Over the last few days, the scandal with Luo Feifei has gained a lot of attention. I thought it was true and was going to ask Chu about it, but then I found out that the Public Relations Department terminated her contract and announced that GK was never going to use her again. So, I assumed that Luo Feifei must have used my son as a stepping stone to fame, which angered him.\"</p><p>Jiang Linyue nodded. \"That is correct. Someone like President Qin would never date a celebrity with a bad reputation. As GK's employee, I have faith in him.\"</p><p>Satisfied with her answer, Mrs. Qin nodded. \"I'm glad to hear it from you. Personally, I don't want Chu to be mixed up with the likes of the entertainment industry. The backgrounds of female celebrities are usually messy. Those women will do anything to get ahead, and are involved in too many scandals. Naturally, they're not eligible to enter the Qin Family.\"</p><p>\"They won't since they don't even have the chance to get near President Qin. Plus, President Qin… has extremely strong self-control.\"</p><p>Jiang Linyue said that as a compliment. From her observations, Qin Chu had never shown intimacy towards any woman.</p><p>He always arrived at work on time and left work on time. Aside from his assistant, Yang, no one else was able to get near him.</p><p>\"I know my son well, but rumors are scary. He's so outstanding but is still single, and people will gossip. The Qin family values reputation, and I don't want anyone to take this opportunity to spread untrue rumors.\"</p><p>\"So… has President Qin ever had a girlfriend?\" Truth be told, Jiang Linyue also wondered if Qin Chu was gay.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":206,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:27.427","Link":"Chapter-206","NameDisplay":"Chapter 206"},{"ID":181120949278909384,"Name":"Chapter 207: Incite Defection","NameUnsign":"Chapter 207: Incite Defection","Description":"<p>Chapter 207: Incite Defection</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Mrs. Qin's expression changed slightly at her question. \"He had a girlfriend, but they broke up after dating for a little while. They weren't compatible. It happened a long time ago, and shortly after that, my son went abroad.

Since President Qin had a girlfriend in the past, outside rumors are nothing more than just rumors.\" Jiang Linyue felt relieved.</p><p>\"Miss Jiang, I want to ask you a question, and I hope that you can answer me truthfully.\"</p><p>\"I will, Mrs. Qin.\"</p><p>\"Do you like Chu?\" Mrs. Qin asked as she stared at Jiang Linyue.</p><p>Jiang Linyue's face immediately blushed…</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded.</p><p>Mrs. Qin smiled. \"Do you want to be his girlfriend?\"</p><p>Jiang Linyue looked up, her expression grim. \"President Qin… will never go for me.\"</p><p>\"You won't know until you try, am I right?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean, Mrs. Qin?\" Jiang Linyue was shocked – did Mrs. Qin just offer to help her?</p><p>Mrs. Qin saw through Jiang Linyue's surprise and added, \"I like that you have a clean family background. You may not be the daughter of someone with a hefty background, but you have a simple family and your parents are all scholars who immigrated abroad. You have an advanced degree and are good at your job. All in all, you are an ideal daughter-in-law.\"</p><p>\"Mrs. Qin, I…\" Exhilarated, Jiang Linyue wasn't sure what to say.</p><p>\"Anyways, I will make sure to create opportunities for the two of you. I believe that sincerity will be rewarded. Chu may seem indifferent, but he cozies up once you get to know him.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Mrs. Qin!\" Jiang Linyue nodded in gratitude.</p><p>Then, she stayed at the Qin Manor for dinner. After they finished, Qin Chu suddenly came home.</p><p>\"Mom. What did you want me for? Is Dad not feeling well?\" Qin Chu asked as he walked in through the door.</p><p>\"Oh, he's doing fine, he went on a rehabilitation trip to the hot springs in the mountains, so he's not at home.\"</p><p>Qin Chu didn't say anything else upon hearing his mother's reply; however, he saw Jiang Linyue, sitting beside her.</p><p>\"President Qin,\" Jiang Linyue greeted him.</p><p>\"Why are you here?\" Qin Chu wasn't happy.</p><p>\"I asked her to come report about the company. I haven't had time to go to the GK recently on account of taking care of your father.\"</p><p>\"If there's nothing else, I'm going to leave now,\" Qin Chu said as he turned around to leave.</p><p>\"Chu, the driver took a day off today, and it's hard to hail a cab in this area. Can you take Linyue with you? After all, she's your employee,\" Mrs. Qin suddenly said.</p><p>Qin Chu turned around to look at his mother and then glanced at Jiang Linyue. Finally, he said, \"Let's go.\"</p><p>Jiang Linyue was elated that Qin Chu agreed. Before she headed out the door, Mrs. Qin gave her a look of encouragement.</p><p>She trailed behind Qin Chu all the way to his Maybach. But right after she opened the door to the passenger seat, Qin Chu said coldly, \"Sit in the back.\"</p><p>\"Okay, President Qin.\" Afraid to say more, she got into the back seat.</p><p>In the beginning, neither of them said anything. Jiang Linyue remained quiet, afraid that she would say something wrong.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Chu asked, \"What did my mom talk to you about?\"</p><p>\"No…nothing much, just work stuff.\"</p><p>\"You can't trick me.

She asked carefully, \"President Qin, are you asking me to be a double agent, to act in front of Mrs. Qin and keep her in the dark?\"</p><p>\"I can give you a 20% raise.\"</p><p>\"I don't care about the pay raise, President Qin, you don't know what I mean.

Charge it to the company, and the Finance Department will compensate you tomorrow.\"</p><p>Sad and unwilling, Jiang Linyue got off the car and watched as Qin Chu's Maybach sped away.</p><p>He was always so heartless, even demanding that she get off his car halfway. However, she just couldn't bring herself to give up on him.</p><p>Huo Mian was driving home after work but was delayed by a traffic jam. It was rush hour, and she was stuck in between red lights.</p><p>Bored, Huo Mian took out her phone, took a photo of the traffic jam, and posted the photo on her friend circle.</p><p>She wrote, \"The newest 'Jam City' has been discovered, C City is the jammiest of them all.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling immediately replied, \"Agreed, let's call this place Jam City from now on.\"</p><p>Zhixin also replied, \"Sis, did you buy a car?\"</p><p>Huo Mian immediately replied, \"No, the hospital lent it to me to use.\"</p><p>Zhixin, the innocent and unassuming boy that he was, replied with a 'yay' emoji. \"Awesome, sis. Take me out on a ride sometime.\"</p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to reply to him, the light turned green, and she turned her attention back onto the road.</p><p>When she passed by a supermarket, she parked her car and walked in, hoping to buy some fruits and vegetables.</p><p>However, she saw a strange scene. A man had kicked a woman onto the floor. She looked like she was in pain, but the man just kept hitting her.</p><p>A lot of people gathered around them, but no one stepped out to stop the man. After Huo Mian saw who the couple was, her heart filled with complicated emotions.</p><p>It was the pregnant patient that she saved a while back, and the man who was hitting her was her husband.</p><p>\"Honey, please come home, I beg you. Our daughters miss you,\" the woman wailed.</p><p>\"You stupid jinxed woman, can you stop crying? All you do is cry every single day, no wonder I have such bad luck. I lost money, and almost ended up in jail. You seriously ruined my life! I'd rather beat you to death,\" the man cursed as he continued hitting her.</p><p>\"Stop hitting her, what kind of man hits his own wife?\" The people around them tried to stop the man.</p><p>\"Get the f*ck away, we're married! The police don't even interfere, so why don't you go mind your own business too?!\" The man was extremely arrogant.</p><p>The woman just cried and cried on the ground…</p><p>Huo Mian lingered for a while and lost her mood to buy food. She just turned around and headed back to her car.</p><p>She wasn't going to step up and help her. Huo Mian was the one who saved her life, but she almost got into big trouble because of her. It was like the story of the farmer and the snake, so Huo Mian didn't pity her. There's an old saying: you reap what you sow, and those that are pathetic certainly have some reason to be despised. She was a victim of domestic violence; yet, not only did she refuse to divorce him, she actually believed that she couldn't live without him. A woman like her was never going to find happiness.</p><p>A while ago, she begged Huo Mian to let her husband go. That was reasonable, but later she took advantage of the media to force Huo Mian's decision, infuriating her. She didn't have to go through the trouble of putting on a show because even if she had asked Huo Mian in private to forgive her husband, Huo Mian would have agreed.</p><p>Huo Mian was okay with the outcome of the incident. As long as they stopped picking on the hospital and the hospital's and her own reputation recovered, she was fine.</p><p>However, now Huo Mian was thinking that an as*hole like him should be in jail; he was a scourge on this earth.</p><p>The life they were living today was a result of karma… all tragedies began with choices.</p><p>Huo Mian wasted some time on the road and it was almost 7 PM when she arrived back at home, her hands empty.</p><p>She smelled oil and fumes as soon as she walked in…</p><p>Astonished, she walked to the kitchen to see something for the first time – Qin Chu was in a white shirt and black suit pants, making stir-fry.</p><p>That's right, Mr. Qin, our master Qin, was making stir-fry!</p><p>\"Um… President Qin, can you tell me what you're doing?\" curious, Huo Mian asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":208,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:28.477","Link":"Chapter-208","NameDisplay":"Chapter 208"},{"ID":181120949289447541,"Name":"Chapter 209: Bad Stuff","NameUnsign":"Chapter 209: Bad Stuff","Description":"<p>Chapter 209: Bad Stuff</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I'm learning how to make Chinese food.\" His simple answer left Huo Mian dumbfounded.</p><p>\"You, you, you… Why are you learning how to make Chinese food? I can cook.\" Huo Mian thought that the food she made tasted good enough, so they were fine as long as she knew how to cook. Qin Chu had been in the United States for the last seven years, so to him, learning how to cook Chinese cuisine was like starting from the beginning. It was too much of a hassle.</p><p>\"Don't you like Chinese?\"</p><p>\"But I know how to make it,\" Huo Mian answered helplessly.</p><p>\"Sometimes you get off work late, and you're tired and hungry. I get off work early and have time anyways,\" Qin Chu said slowly as he plated a pan of mushroom stir-fry.</p><p>The delicious smell of food overwhelmed her senses, and Huo Mian's eyes became misty.</p><p>She was extremely touched by his gesture…</p><p>The truth was, it wasn't a big deal for a husband to cook a meal for his wife. However, Qin Chu wasn't just any husband; he was GK's CEO, a man who was always super busy and would kill for there to be 72 hours in a day.</p><p>GK had seven branch companies, each a leader in their respective industry. Qin Chu had to sit through at least 4 to 5 hours of meetings every day.</p><p>However, he still managed to make it home from work on time and cook her dinner. How could she not be touched?</p><p>\"Go wash your hands and change out of your clothes, dinner is ready.\"</p><p>Silent, Huo Mian went upstairs and changed into a set of loungewear. Then, she washed her hands.</p><p>By the time she sat down by the dining table, she saw that four dishes and one soup were already set on the table before her. She could tell by looking at the color of the dishes that they would definitely taste good.</p><p>\"The food looks delicious,\" Huo Mian exclaimed as she looked at all the food in front of her.</p><p>Steamed bass, mushroom pork stir-fry, bitter melon stir-fry, and braised pork ribs. He even made clam soup!</p><p>Qin Chu picked up a bowl, filled it with clam soup, and handed it to her.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>Huo Mian took a little sip and gave him a thumbs-up, \"This is delicious, I don't even know how to make clam soup, how did you manage it?\"</p><p>\"The company's chef taught me. His food tastes good, so I asked him.\"</p><p>\"Wow, chefs from big corporations sure are different from the rest of us.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>This was Qin Chu's first time cooking, so Huo Mian had a bowl and a half of rice, much more than she usually ate.</p><p>In the end, she still couldn't help but say, \"If I weren't afraid of gaining weight, I would've had another bowl.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry about it, I don't care if you're fat.\"</p><p>\"But I do, I don't want to gain too much weight.\" Huo Mian battered her eyelashes with an adorable expression on her face.</p><p>Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian as a feeling of satisfaction overwhelmed his heart. All he wanted with Huo Mian was simple happiness.</p><p>The next morning, after Huo Mian arrived at South Side Recuperation Center and changed into her uniform. She then went and measured the blood pressure of the old man in room 2.</p><p>\"Sir, you need to take it easy these days and no more sneaking in desserts. Your blood sugar is higher than before.\"</p><p>\"I got it. Hey kid, if you're not busy, let's play some chess again.\" The patient's expression lit up with anticipation. Ever since he found out that Huo Mian was skilled in chess, he kept asking her to play with him.</p><p>\"Sure, but you'll have to wait; I have to administer an IV for the 'young master' in the other room first.\"</p><p>Then, Huo Mian went back to the on-call station, gathered some prescribed medicine, and headed towards room 1.</p><p>His bodyguards all seemed to be having breakfast; the one left to guard the door was busy sending WeChat messages on his phone. He didn't even notice it when Huo Mian opened the door to go in.</p><p>Huo Mian went in after knocking on the door…</p><p>The scene that confronted her embarrassed her to the max.</p><p>A beautiful woman with a smoking-hot body was having an intimate moment with Su Yu; she had taken her clothes off and her actions were incredibly flirtatious.</p><p>Huo Mian's sudden appearance scared the woman, and she immediately pulled her clothes back on in a panic.</p><p>\"Um… Sorry, you guys continue,\" Huo Mian said as she turned around to leave.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, get the f*ck back in here,\" Su Yu blustered loudly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":209,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:28.947","Link":"Chapter-209","NameDisplay":"Chapter 209"},{"ID":181120949294301304,"Name":"Chapter 210: Treatment Methods","NameUnsign":"Chapter 210: Treatment Methods","Description":"<p>Chapter 210: Treatment Methods</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Um, I don't think that's a good idea.\" Huo Mian turned around, her expression awkward.</p><p>How on earth would she have known that she might run into something like this… in a hospital?!</p><p>Su Yu looked at the beautiful woman beside him. \"Get the hell out of here.\"</p><p>\"Young Master Su…\" She was obviously unwilling.</p><p>\"Enough, get the hell out of here.\"</p><p>With tears in her eyes, the beautiful woman had no choice but to put on her clothes and head out the door. As she passed by Huo Mian, she glared at her angrily.</p><p>It seemed like she was blaming Huo Mian for ruining their moment...</p><p>Huo Mian looked at the woman and then muttered to herself, \"Hm, she looks pretty familiar. Isn't she the anchor of that travel channel? I think it's that 8 PM show called 'Walk Around the World'.\"</p><p>\"Have the bodyguards out there died? Why the hell did they let you in?\" Su Yu asked crossly.</p><p>It had been days since he was admitted into this stupid recuperation center, and his life had been as dry as that of a monk.</p><p>That anchor was here to deliver him breakfast, so Su Yu decided to have some fun with her.</p><p>To his surprise, Huo Mian walked right in.</p><p>However, for some weird reason, after Huo Mian walked in on them, Su Yu lost all of his appetite for that woman.</p><p>He got so annoyed at her that he immediately chased her out.</p><p>Upon hearing Su Yu's questions, Huo Mian answered truthfully, \"I think three of them went to breakfast, and the big tall dude outside was glued to the WeChat app on his phone. By analyzing the state of his obsession, I deduce that he's in love. Therefore, he completely ignored my existence.\"</p><p>Su Yu looked up and glanced at Huo Mian. He said sourly, \"Are you Sherlock Holmes? Is this a crime scene? Of course, I know what's going on with my own bodyguards.\"</p><p>Huo Mian immediately stopped talking.</p><p>\"Come here.\" Su Yu waved her over.</p><p>\"What do you want?\"</p><p>\"I thought you were here to administer my IV. Hurry up, I need to get out of this garbage dump as soon as possible.\" Su Yu was a little impatient.</p><p>He seldom requested an IV on his own accord; Huo Mian took a few steps forward and injected him with a needle.</p><p>Su Yu seemed to have gotten used to Huo Mian's techniques; he was no longer against injections.</p><p>Huo Mian stood close to him. She lowered her head and a few strands of hair fell off from behind her ears.</p><p>Su Yu was actually tempted to lift them up for her…</p><p>Just then, Huo Mian suddenly looked up to see Su Yu's arm in the air. Immediately defensive, she asked, \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>She thought, Did I hurt this little bastard, is he going to hit me now?</p><p>To her surprise, Su Yu answered, \"Oh, I just wanted to know if your hair was real or if they're extensions.\"</p><p>\"What does my hair have to do with you? What kind of hobby is that?\" Huo Mian glanced at him cautiously as she mumbled to herself.</p><p>Su Yu was also embarrassed at his own lame excuse, so he immediately changed the subject, \"I liked the kimbap you made yesterday, so make more when you get home today and bring me some tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Why should I?\" Huo Mian crossed her arms and looked at Su Yu.</p><p>\"Because I'm your patient.\"</p><p>\"It's not a hospital policy. You're rich enough to eat panda meat if you fancy it, why would you want my kimbap?\"</p><p>\"Because it tastes good, why else?\"</p><p>\"Weirdo,\" Huo Mian said as she turned around to leave.</p><p>\"Hey, come back.\"</p><p>\"What else do you want?\" Huo Mian turned around.</p><p>\"The weather's nice today, take me out for a walk.\"</p><p>\"Isn't that a job for your bodyguards?\" Huo Mian was surprised.</p><p>Did he take the wrong pills today? She wondered.</p><p>\"I'm tired of looking at men, so it's your turn today.\"</p><p>\"I…\" Huo Mian was just about to refuse when Su Yu added, \"This is within your scope of responsibilities as a nurse. If you refuse, I'll file a complaint against you.\"</p><p>With no other choice, Huo Mian carefully helped Su Yu up. They took the elevator down to the garden behind the hospital.</p><p>It was indeed nice outside, as the sun was shining high in the sky.</p><p>Huo Mian had to support his weight, so naturally, they had physical contact.</p><p>Su Yu justly lifted his arm and wrapped it around Huo Mian's skinny shoulders.</p><p>Comparing the 1.85-meter tall Su Yu to the 1.65-meter tall Huo Mian, there was indeed a big gap.</p><p>Just as Huo Mian saw a pavilion up front and wanted to see if he wanted to go sit down, she realized that Su Yu's head was lowered, and his eyes were staring at her chest…</p><p>Then, that dude shamelessly commented, \"No wonder you're wearing an oversized uniform.

But if she was fired, the other stupid nurses would be the ones to give him injections. He would suffer if they were anything like the first idiot.</p><p>After convincing himself, Su Yu decided that he would be the bigger man and forgive that damned girl.</p><p>He would never have thought that Huo Mian would voluntarily propose to stop taking care of Su Yu, for one simple reason.</p><p>Him being difficult to take care of aside, she was sick of being taken advantage of.</p><p>Speaking of what happened today, if Qin Chu found out, he would definitely choke her to death.</p><p>Although her marriage with Qin Chu was not completely consensual, Huo Mian still thought that it would be better if she avoided intimate contact with other men.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, don't be like this. If you don't take the job, no one else will. You're the best candidate.\" Nannan, the other nurse on shift, also tried convincing her with all her heart.</p><p>\"We will be fine. We have so many nurses here, so there must be some that are good. Anyways, giving shots isn't hard. They'll get used to it after a few tries so it'll be the same without me.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, did Mr. Su give you a hard time?\" the head nurse couldn't hold herself back and asked.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded...</p><p>\"Huo Mian, how about this, I'll give you an additional 500 yuan every day. I'll pass it through to the higher-ups…\"</p><p>Huo Mian held out her hand and interrupted the head nurse, \"Head Nurse, it's not about money. I don't want to take care of him anymore. Leave the elder in room 2 to me, or transfer me to the neurosurgery department. I'd rather look after patients with cerebral palsy.\"</p><p>In Huo Mian's mind, taking care of patients with cerebral palsy would be much easier than taking care of Su Yu. At the very least, they wouldn't have such arrogant and dominant attitudes.</p><p>Although she was a nurse with a kind heart, she still had a temper. If she didn't reveal her fangs as a tiger, she may be mistaken for a Hello Kitty.</p><p>Upon hearing Huo Mian's words, the head nurse stopped insisting and nodded her head.</p><p>That night, a new nurse was arranged to give him injections. However, right as she walked in, Su Yu drove her out.</p><p>He said, \"Bring Huo Mian here.\"</p><p>\"Young... Young Master Su, Huo Mian won't be in charge of giving you shots anymore.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" With a cold face, Su Yu scanned the nurse's terrified face.</p><p>\"She said… she said…\" The nurse was so scared that she had no idea what to say.</p><p>\"Are you a stutterer? Hurry up and tell me what she said!\" Su Yu was going crazy.</p><p>\"She said that she'd rather… she'd rather take care of patients with cerebral palsy than take care of you, Young Master Su.\"</p><p>After hearing her sentence, Su Yu's face darkened… Great, he did not even fuss over being abandoned under the burning sun at the garden earlier today, and Huo Mian had already begun playing tricks on him now.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":211,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:29.92","Link":"Chapter-211","NameDisplay":"Chapter 211"},{"ID":181120949303933605,"Name":"Chapter 212: The Hidden Truth","NameUnsign":"Chapter 212: The Hidden Truth","Description":"<p>Chapter 212: The Hidden Truth</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Go get your head nurse.\" Su Yu was feeling a bit infuriated.</p><p>Finally, when the head nurse Song Lin arrived, she apologized profusely but did not mention a thing about Huo Mian.</p><p>At last, it was Su Yu who had to lower his stance and request for Huo Mian. \"About that Huo Mian, she will be in charge of my care from now on. Don't let other nurses near me, they're as dumb as pigs.\"</p><p>What our Young Master Su meant was that out of all the nurses, Huo Mian was the only one with decent skills. But the most important thing was, Huo Mian was not just an ordinary nurse. Although she did not have the certifications of a doctor, she was a nurse who could perform a C-section on a pregnant woman. That by itself proved her excellence. Director Wu was correct in stating that Huo Mian was wasting her talent being a nurse, but it was Huo Mian who was willing to do so.</p><p>Upon hearing Su Yu asking about Huo Mian, Song Lin was a little perturbed, \"Young Master Su, I'm sorry, Huo Mian, she…\"</p><p>\"I don't care what she thinks, get her here no matter what. Money is not a problem, ask her how much she wants and put a price on her head. Is a hundred thousand yuan a day enough?\" Su Yu waved his hand, looking like he did not care about anything.</p><p>To be truthful, he also wasn't confident if the money was going to be enough. He knew that Huo Mian did not really care about money, since his attempt to buy kimbap from her failed completely.</p><p>\"It's not about the money, Mr. Su.\" Song Lin's response was as expected.</p><p>\"I don't believe that there are issues in this world that cannot be resolved with money,\" Young Master Su's spoiled attitude surfaced again, and he coldly snorted.</p><p>\"Young Master Su, Huo Mian is different.\"</p><p>\"What's different about her? They all have one nose and two eyes. She's not even that pretty, her chest is pathetically small, and her temper is disgusting. Women like her are nothing special,\" Su Yu harshly evaluated.</p><p>Song Lin smiled and explained, \"Huo Mian's thoughts are a little different from the others. I thought of her the same way before, but after getting to know her, I discovered her eccentricity. Her work is purely for her own enjoyment. She is great at what she does, but she can also be quite stubborn.\"</p><p>Song Lin was right; putting aside Huo Mian's ethics, her skills were indeed excellent, but she was way too stubborn.</p><p>No matter how she was instructed, Huo Mian would not treat Su Yu as a VIP patient. Quite a few times, Song Lin felt as if Young Master Su would burn the recuperation center down in anger. What would they do then? Huo Mian wasn't only not careful, she also refused to take care of Young Master Su. Her reasoning was that she would rather take care of those with cerebral palsy than this young master. If Su Yu were to find out about this, would he blow the center up?</p><p>Song Lin did not know that Su Yu had already heard about it. Although he almost exploded from anger, he still calmed down and insisted on Huo Mian becoming his personal nurse. That would give him more opportunities to get to know Huo Mian, and then, take his revenge.</p><p>\"You're her boss, you can hand her a mandate.\" Su Yu looked at Song Lin and gave her an idea.</p><p>\"But if I did that, she'll quit. Then, I'll be at fault, Young Master Su…\"</p><p>\"What? She would rather quit than take care of me?\" Su Yu's pride felt beaten down.</p><p>\"She might be afraid that she'll be held responsible for improper care. Girls now are smart, they don't want to face too much responsibility,\" Song Lin kindly explained.</p><p>\"That's all, you can leave now.\" Seeing that Song Lin couldn't help him, Su Yu waved his hand, not wanting to speak with her anymore.</p><p>He picked up his phone and dialed a number, \"Did you find anything?\"</p><p>\"Sorry, Young Master, nothing yet. Her background is simple, there is nothing to find. Maybe your suspicions are wrong?\"</p><p>Su Yu's face dropped. \"Are you doubting my orders?\"</p><p>\"No, no, Young Master, I just thought that an ordinary woman like her wouldn't have a complex background.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":212,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:30.393","Link":"Chapter-212","NameDisplay":"Chapter 212"},{"ID":181120949309214095,"Name":"Chapter 213: Invitation","NameUnsign":"Chapter 213: Invitation","Description":"<p>Chapter 213: Invitation</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"What do you know? My deductions are never wrong. What a bunch of useless idiots you people are! Keep investigating her for me.\" Hanging up, Su Yu laid on the bed with a complicated look in his eyes.</p><p>His attitude towards Huo Mian was quite unusual. What peaked his interest wasn't their fights at the hospital but her background. Upon investigation, he found out that Huo Mian's story was not pleasant. She had a younger brother, mother, and a stepfather who had already passed away. Her biological father's identity is a mystery. Someone as simple as her caused an internet outrage a while ago, but the tides suddenly turned and Huo Mian was proven innocent almost immediately, establishing a new selfless angel-like image. Something of this magnitude couldn't have been done by a hospital without deep connections. In addition, Huo Mian was not involved with the hospital director Wu Zhongxing, which made it even more strange.</p><p>What kind of powerful party was silently helping an ordinary woman like Huo Mian?</p><p>Back when he saw the news on TV, Su Yu already guessed that the nurse had a complicated background.</p><p>However, after getting to know her, he discovered that she was also a very eccentric woman...</p><p>Everything surrounding Huo Mian piqued Su Yu's interest, and he wanted to get to know her more.</p><p>Things were becoming more and more interesting...</p><p>Huo Mian's refusal to be Su Yu's personal nurse became breaking news at South Side Recuperation Center.</p><p>At lunch in the cafeteria, Huo Mian was singled out in everyone's eyes and became the target of finger-pointing...</p><p>\"Look, you're already at the center of the spotlight at our hospital.\" Nannan covered her mouth and laughed.</p><p>Huo Mian did not speak; she lowered her head and quietly ate her food.</p><p>She was already very lowkey, but she still couldn't avoid being the subject of discussion wherever she went.</p><p>Huo Mian wasn't sure why that was the case; it was as if everything was predestined.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, are you really not going to take care of Su Yu?\"</p><p>\"Mhm,\" facing Nannan's inquisition, Huo Mian only grunted in response.</p><p>\"But won't you regret it if you miss this opportunity? Although Young Master Su's temper isn't the best, being his personal nurse is the dream of all the nurses at South Side. Do you know how many nurses envy, admire, and hate you?\"</p><p>\"If they want to do it, they can. Why would they be jealous, envious, and resentful?\"</p><p>\"Nonsense, they all went, but do you think Young Master Su approved any of them? Young Master Su treats you pretty well. You've administered so many shots for him, and he never got angry with you. What's your secret?\" Nannan curiously asked.</p><p>Huo Mian's face filled with helplessness as she finished her food. She looked at the younger girl in front of her and said, \"I really don't have any secrets.\"</p><p>\"Oh… Then maybe it's your technique! You're so good that your injections don't hurt. Huo Mian, please teach me. I want to learn from you.\"</p><p>\"Please, that's the most basic thing. Didn't you learn it in medical school?\" Huo Mian found it both funny and sad.</p><p>Nannan had been a nurse for a while already, but she wanted to learn how to give shots from Huo Mian. Huo Mian really wondered if she paid attention in medical school. Why didn't she know the most basic skills, and why would South Side hire her? Was it just because she was pretty?</p><p>\"Yeah, I learned it, but it's a different case for Young Master Su. He's harder to deal with. Please, Huo Mian.\"</p><p>Unable to resist Nannan's begging, Huo Mian taught her some injection techniques after taking care of the old man in room 2.</p><p>The girl was also pushing it, and she used her own arm for practice. It was filled with pinpricks by the end of that afternoon.</p><p>After work as she was driving home, Huo Mian's phone suddenly rang...</p><p>She looked at it and left it ringing, because the caller was Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p>Three minutes later, she got a text that read, \"Huo Mian, I'm getting married to Wu Xiaoxue on the 17th of next month.

Finally, she lost patience and drove through a side street and around the highway. As she drove, she actually passed by the headquarters of GK Corporation. </p><p>The skyscraper lit up into an aqua blue color when the night fell. Designed like the National Aquatics Center, the building was especially entrancing.</p><p>It was said that the building became the most iconic construction of C City, and the most ridiculous thing about it was that when tourists traveled to the city, they would treat the building as a famous landmark and take pictures with it.</p><p>Huo Mian once jokingly told Qin Chu that GK could just dive straight into the field of tourism, and he actually replied that he didn't have time right now and would think about it later.</p><p>Upon passing by Qin Chu's office, the roads became surprisingly congested again. Maybe it was because of the evening commute, but there were just too many cars on the road.</p><p>Bored, Huo Mian scrolled through her phone and suddenly got an idea.</p><p>She sent a WeChat message to Qin Chu, \"President Qin, I'm at your company. May I have the honor of having dinner with you?\"</p><p>When Qin Chu saw the WeChat message, he was in the conference room, discussing the company's plan for next quarter's jewelry release conference.</p><p>Jiang Linyue was vividly presenting the details of the site, price, and styles of a few best-selling jewelers, and the market sales trends after launch.</p><p>Right as Qin Chu's phone rang, everyone looked in his direction...</p><p>The only contact in Qin Chu's WeChat was Huo Mian. He didn't even have Gao Ran added, since he would call if he ever needed something from him.</p><p>After reading the WeChat message, Qin Chu quickly got up and interrupted Jiang Linyue's presentation. \"I have somewhere to be for a moment, you guys continue.\"</p><p>\"President Qin, how are we supposed to continue if you're gone?\" Jiang Linyue felt like weeping, but she had no tears. She had been preparing for the meeting for two weeks now, losing sleep and appetite because she wanted to perform in front of the president and receive his compliments. Even a single compliment would have sufficed.</p><p>Qin Chu glanced at his assistant, \"Record the meeting and send it to my email. I'll watch it when I'm free. That's all.\"</p><p>After speaking, Qin Chu turned around and exited the conference room, leaving a dozen executives still seated.</p><p>Most of them were used to the new president's style of doing things by now...</p><p>It was true that the new president would always leave halfway through, or come early and leave early; he was unpredictable as hell.</p><p>However, the profits of GK were increasing exponentially. Statistics showed that the profit last month had already passed that of the same period last year. The chairman had personally visited and inspected the company, and he was clearly pleased.</p><p>Huo Mian was prepared to leave after seeing no reply from Qin Chu. She didn't think too much and thought Qin Chu was just busy.</p><p>At that moment, someone knocked on her car window...</p><p>She turned her head around with shock. \"Uh… Why are you here?\"</p><p>\"Didn't you ask me out for dinner?\" Qin Chu's face was serious.</p><p>Huo Mian was only joking, but to Qin Chu, this was the first time Huo Mian asked him out to dinner after seven years. How could he refuse?</p><p>\"But are you done with work?\" Huo Mian saw that the lights in the building were still on. She could tell that the departments were still working overtime.</p><p>Qin Chu did not reply; he walked to the passenger seat, opened the door and got in. Looking at Huo Mian, he asked, \"What are we eating?\"</p><p>\"How about Ah-Xin's Ramen?\" without thinking, Huo Mian said. That was actually what she wanted to eat.</p><p>\"Drive,\" Qin Chu pointed at the steering wheel and commanded.</p><p>Then, Huo Mian's light-hearted prank became reality. Not only did she have to dine with President Qin, she also had to be his chauffeur...</p><p>Inside the noodle house, the two ordered ramen and some appetizers, which were quite delicious. Watching the students of Second High School come and leave made Huo Mian lament the greatness of youth.</p><p>Maybe she had too much fun eating, but she didn't even notice the soup stain by her lips.</p><p>Qin Chu put down his chopsticks and gently wiped her face with a tissue...</p><p>Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu and felt like they had time traveled back to seven years ago...</p><p>\"Don't look at me like that. I might get the illusion that you're still in love with me,\" Qin Chu abruptly said.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":214,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:31.397","Link":"Chapter-214","NameDisplay":"Chapter 214"},{"ID":181120949318836397,"Name":"Chapter 215: Forgetful","NameUnsign":"Chapter 215: Forgetful","Description":"<p>Chapter 215: Forgetful</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Ahem... yeah, it is an illusion,\" Huo Mian replied awkwardly, and then she lowered her head to eat her noodles, not saying another word. At this sight, hints of disappointment appeared in Qin Chu's eyes… </p><p>He knew that she had feelings for him, but he was surprised that she couldn't admit it or see it herself. </p><p>This also proved that she hadn't gotten over what happened seven years ago, which brought up the question, when would they ever untie the knots in their hearts and get over the past? </p><p>After dinner, Qin Chu and Huo Mian went home together. </p><p>Qin Chu went upstairs to work, while Huo Mian stayed downstairs. She changed into her loungewear and did some cleaning around the place. </p><p>Qin Chu seemed to be done work around 8:30 PM, and he came downstairs to watch the Financial News channel. </p><p>Meanwhile, Huo Mian was watching a TV show on her laptop. </p><p>Just then, she suddenly thought of something and said, \"Oh right, Ning Zhiyuan called me today, but I didn't pick it up. He sent me a text afterward.\" </p><p>\"Who's Ning Zhiyuan?\" Qin Chu raised his head. </p><p>Huo Mian was at a loss for words... </p><p>Here we go again... this guy always pretended to not remember someone he didn't like. </p><p>With Qin Chu's intelligence, he would definitely be able to remember someone's name. He was just being arrogant, pretending that he had forgotten the names of people that were insignificant. </p><p>\"That terrible ex-boyfriend of mine.\" </p><p>\"Oh, did he want to get back together with you?\" asked Qin Chu nonchalantly. </p><p>Huo Mian shuddered. \"Why would he? He's about to marry Wu Xiaoxue, and he said the wedding was going to be on the 17th of next month.\" </p><p>\"So, you want me to help you to kidnap the groom?\" </p><p>\"Please, can you behave more properly?\" Huo Mian felt extremely speechless in front of Qin Chu's unreasonable response. </p><p>Qin Chu only looked at her faintly, and continued to say, \"Would you still be sitting there so perfectly untouched, if I wasn't behaving myself?\" </p><p>In front of such \"deep\" words, Huo Mian immediately understood what he meant, even though she thought that she was fairly innocent… </p><p>\"Uhm… okay, let's discuss something else then. I was only telling you about it, I never planned on going to the wedding anyway.\" </p><p>\"You should go to the wedding,\" Qin Chu said as he watched the news. </p><p>\"Why? I will have to buy them a present if I go, and that's not something I want to do.\" Huo Mian didn't want to waste even a cent on a person like Ning Zhiyuan. </p><p>\"No, you must go, and you have to buy them a super expensive present,\" said Qin Chu arrogantly. </p><p>Huo Mian was left speechless, but just then, Qin Chu added, \"I want him to know how rich your husband is, and how right it was for you to leave him back then. More than anything, you have to let him know that no matter how hard he works his whole life, he will never earn as much as I can, and he should get rid of any thoughts about you.\" </p><p>Huo Mian was now truly speechless and had no clue how to respond.</p><p>Qin Chu was incredibly immature for wanting to do that, in addition to making it look like she married him for money. </p><p>Besides, Ning Zhiyuan wouldn't be stupid enough to compete with the president of GK over who was wealthier.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Chu went to work, while Huo Mian didn't have much to do because she had time off from her shifts. </p><p>She was deciding between having lunch with Lingling, or visiting Zhixing at his school. </p><p>Just then, her phone rang, and the display showed that it was an unknown caller. </p><p>\"Is this Huo Mian?\" a young man asked on the other end after Huo Mian picked up. </p><p>\"I am.\" </p><p>\"I'm Huo Siyi,\" he said. </p><p>\"Oh you, what do you want?\" Huo Mian was surprised to hear that it was Huo Siyi, because she hasn't had much interaction with him. He even picked on her at their grandmother's funeral, and she retaliated, which resulted in discontent on both sides. </p><p>She knew that sim cards were linked to the owner's real identity and that it wouldn't be difficult for Huo Siyi to get her number. But why did he suddenly call her?

Didn't he have plenty of devoted kids? There was Huo Siqian, Huo Siyi, and that Huo Yanyan. </p><p>She would be inviting abuse onto herself if she went. Plus, he never even acknowledge her existence, so why would she go just to be humiliated? </p><p>Also, what kind of family identity would she go as? It was ridiculous… </p><p>After she hung up the phone, Huo Mian oddly enough headed back to her mother's and bought some fruits, vegetables, and beef along the way. </p><p>When she entered the yard, Yang Meirong was playing Mahjong with a couple of women in her neighborhood, and they were all quite happy. </p><p>\"You're back, Mian,\" everyone smiled and greeted her. </p><p>Huo Mian smiled, and then went in to start on lunch preparations. </p><p>At noon, with only her and her mother left in the room, she hesitated for a bit before saying, \"Mom, Huo Siyi, that boy Shen Jiani gave birth to, called me today. He said that Huo Zhenghai had another heart attack and wants to see me in the hospital, but I don't want to go. I know many people would call me an ungrateful daughter, and say that I don't even care for my own father's life, but I don't want you to feel bad. I only consider you and Zhixin my family, and I don't want you guys to be sad.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's words moved Yang Meirong… </p><p>However, she didn't say anything for quite a while afterward, as she ate in silence. But, after the meal was finished, she suddenly said, \"Get your stuff, and come with me to visit him in the hospital.\" </p><p>Huo Mian slightly froze, as she didn't expect this kind of response from her mother… </p><p>\"Mom…?\" Huo Mian wanted to convince her otherwise. </p><p>\"I know what I'm doing, so come with me.\" </p><p>Then, Huo Mian cleaned up the dishes and headed towards the First Hospital with her mother. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't speak at all on the taxi, because she didn't know why her mother wanted to go, or what she wanted out of this. </p><p>Maybe her heart softened because he was sick and wanted to mend things with him, regardless of what had happened in the past? </p><p>Or was it because she knew that he was sick, and that he had been punished by karma, which alleviated her hatred, and that she wanted to see him fallen from grace? </p><p>Regardless, at that moment, Huo Mian decided that she would support her mother no matter what. </p><p>Even though her mother had always been harsh to her, she did feed her and raise her. </p><p>She knew that she had to be grateful to the person who raised her, and she would always keep that in mind... </p><p>In the VIP room of the First Hospital, news of Huo Zhenghai's hospitalization was completely sealed; none of the media outlets knew. </p><p>There were two bodyguards standing outside, and just as Huo Mian and her mother arrived at the door, Shen Jiani happened to walk out from inside. </p><p>She smiled strangely when she saw Yang Meirong, \"Go in, he's waiting for you.\" </p><p>Yang Meirong didn't say anything; she looked at Shen Jiani coldly and then walked in with Huo Mian. </p><p>Yang Meirong was actually quite beautiful, but because of all the years of rough times, she already lost all of her beauty. </p><p>However, it was different for Shen Jiani. Even though she and Yang Meirong were about the same age, she had spent her years in luxury. She had been living well and eating well, and therefore looked at least fifteen years younger than Yang Meirong. Her temperament was different as well.</p><p>Shen Jiani glanced at Huo Mian, with mockery and disdain in her eyes. </p><p>Huo Mian didn't care about her at all and just followed her mother into the room. </p><p>When Huo Zhenghai saw Yang Meirong, the apple he was holding in his hand dropped to the floor. </p><p>\"You…?\" He was quite surprised.</p><p>\"Mr. Huo, it's been a while.\" Yang Meirong handed her bag to Huo Mian as she sat down on the chair in front of Huo Zhenghai, with a graceful smile on her face.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":216,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:32.397","Link":"Chapter-216","NameDisplay":"Chapter 216"},{"ID":181120949329182602,"Name":"Chapter 217: Old Times","NameUnsign":"Chapter 217: Old Times","Description":"<p>Chapter 217: Old Times</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Rong… Rong,\" Huo Zhenghai struggled to say those two words with complex expressions. </p><p>\"You don't seem to be so well over the past few years.

Come, take a look, Mian is 24 years old now.\" </p><p>Yang Meirong reached out her hand and pulled Huo Mian in closer. </p><p>Huo Zhenghai raised his head and looked at Huo Mian with odd complexity. </p><p>Huo Mian's appearance was strange in that she didn't look like Huo Zhenghai at all, nor did she look like Yang Meirong. </p><p>You could even say that she turned out much better than both of them. </p><p>She didn't rely on money to fix her face surgically or with makeup as Huo Yanyan does. </p><p>Her natural elegance was enough to beat anyone, even if she didn't wear any makeup. </p><p>Back in the days, Huo Zhenghai fooled around with plenty of women. His scandalous behaviors in the past had forced a lot of women to fight for his attention, and the paparazzi had once even exposed that he was paying for six mistresses at the same time. Many of those women had even gotten abortions for him, while others ended up in mental health institutions. </p><p>Of all those fights between the women, plotting against one another, barely any of them survived unharmed in the end. </p><p>However, Yang Meirong could be considered either the luckiest or unluckiest out of all of Huo Zhenghai's lovers. </p><p>She was lucky enough to have given birth to Huo Mian and to have been able to raise her safely. However, it was unlucky that Huo Mian wasn't allowed to step inside the Huo family for all these years. </p><p>From an outsider's perspective, Yang Meirong's dream of marrying into riches was in shambles, and that she had given up more than she gained. </p><p>However, several years later, she was blessed with a sweet daughter, which was quite a joyous thing. </p><p>\"Mian, come, this is Uncle Huo. He's ten or so years older than your dad, Jing,\" Huo Mian was surprised to hear Yang Meirong introduce them like so. </p><p>Calling her real father 'uncle', and calling her deceased uncle 'dad'? Her mom was clearly out for revenge. </p><p>Even though she knew it was slightly inappropriate, she still obediently said, \"Uncle Huo.\" </p><p>\"Rong, what do you mean by this?\" Huo Zhenghai felt depressed at the sound of 'Uncle'. </p><p>\"Nothing, we're just here to say hi.\" A bright smile remained on Yang Meirong's face. </p><p>\"I know that you still hate me.\" Huo Zhenghai sighed. </p><p>\"Why would I? I should thank you instead, now that I think about it. I should thank you for being so cold back then; you've taught me how to give up on someone. Humans really shouldn't talk of feelings, because it's not worth a thing in front of profits. Even though I haven't been living a wealthy life over the years, I'm quite happy. I've got a son and a daughter, and a bunch of kind neighbors, but you're in really bad shape. How does that saying go again? Karma will come, it's only a matter of time.\" Huo Zhenghai grew more depressed when he heard Yang Meirong's words. </p><p>\"I know that you hate me, and you should, but I want to make things up for you now. I know that I've done wrong onto you and Mian. Rong, I'm truly sorry… I've put you in pain over all these years.\" Huo Zhenghai felt rattled up, as his eyes grew red. </p><p>\"Don't say that, Mr. Huo. I've been very well over the years, there's no need to make things up to us. I raised my daughter myself, so that has nothing to do with you, and there is no point in bringing up sentiments from the past. But, there is one thing… that I must tell you, and it's something that I will never forget. When Jing De got into that car accident and needed a hundred thousand yuan for an urgent surgery, I begged you in the heavy rain. I kneeled down and even knocked my head onto the ground, but you were so indifferent, and refused to save his life… I often think, a hundred thousand means nothing to you and the Huo family, but if you lent it to me back then, Jing De might've not died, so… you already owe De his life, Huo Zhenghai. You wicked-hearted cruel thing, your life will end terribly. I only wish that you could die sooner, only then would I be comforted,\" Yang Meirong enunciated every word harshly, and then she finally broke down crying.</p><p>\"Mom… please, no more.\" Huo Mian hugged her mother, knowing that she couldn't become agitated, given her mother's weak physical state.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":217,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:32.92","Link":"Chapter-217","NameDisplay":"Chapter 217"},{"ID":181120949333966364,"Name":"Chapter 218: Repent","NameUnsign":"Chapter 218: Repent","Description":"<p>Chapter 218: Repent</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>If Yang Meirong didn't say so today, Huo Mian wouldn't have known about this.</p><p>\"Rong, I was blinded, perhaps by jealousy back then. Jing De was my chauffeur, how could he be with you? You were my woman. I didn't want others to touch you, and my jealousy blinded me back then. I know that I've treated Jing De wrong.\" </p><p>After all these years, a cold-hearted man like Huo Zhenghai suddenly admitted his crimes and even repented.</p><p>Yang Meirong couldn't believe it either; she thought that Huo Zhenghai would order his bodyguards to chase them out after she said all that. </p><p>\"What's the point in knowing your crimes now? De passed away seven years ago, and there's probably nothing left of him now,\" Yang Meirong said as she wiped away her tears. </p><p>\"Mian, you don't want to forgive Dad either?\" Huo Zhenghai looked at Huo Mian. </p><p>\"You must be joking, Uncle Huo, I'm only a little commoner, how could I even have the right to discuss forgiveness with you?\" </p><p>Huo Mian's words sounded ordinary, but it was truly much more hurtful… </p><p>The name, 'Uncle Huo', alone put Huo Zhenghai in great misery… </p><p>\"Mian, I'm too old now, and there are things that I regret, but everyone was young once and had made mistakes. I hope I get the chance to make it up to you, truly. I've already left shares for you two in the Huo Family if you guys want to come back, I…\" </p><p>\"No need, we don't care for your family shares. Huo Zhenghai, do you really think that money can solve everything, after everything that had happened? If you do, then go live with your money, and… I really hope that Shen Jiani can stay virtuous after you die. Just look at how coquettish she is, you should worry about whether or not she will cuckold you after you die instead of worrying about us. You should also worry about that son and daughter of yours, and whether or not they can survive Jiang Hong's wrath.\" </p><p>Yang Meirong pulled on Huo Mian's hand and turned to walk away just as she finished speaking. </p><p>Huo Zhenghai was left full of misery… </p><p>After Huo Mian and her mother left, Huo Zhenghai broke a vase in the room and spilled water everywhere. </p><p>Yang Meirong was quite formidable, not only were her words fierce, she was also directly on point, picking out what Huo Zhenghai worried about the most.</p><p>He didn't even have the heart left to care whether Shen Jiani would find herself a new man; he was most worried about that precious son and daughter of his, and what Jiang Hong and Huo Siqian might do to them. </p><p>- Around evening time -  </p><p>Huo Siqian came to visit, and he peeled an apple for his father with a fruit knife.</p><p>\"Dad, here, eat the apple.\" Huo Siqian smiled affectionately. </p><p>However, who knew what was hidden behind that affectionate smile? </p><p>If you have a pet snake, you will always be in danger of getting bit, and that summed up Huo Zhenghai's situation perfectly. Because he wanted to let Shen Jiani, his son, and daughter into the family back then, he had to negotiate the terms with Jiang Hong. The end deal was that Jiang Hong could adopt a son from her sister, who was Huo Siqian. </p><p>During these years, a careless mistake had made Huo Siqian the biggest threat. </p><p>In addition, it was impossible to get rid of Siqian now, because on the surface, he had already become the Huo family heir in the public's eye. </p><p>He was a famously devoted son within the upper-class circle. If Huo Zhenghai wanted to eat fish in the middle of the night, he would drive out with his yacht to fish. </p><p>On the other side, Huo Siyi fooled around, being too busy picking up girls, playing with cars, getting involved in fights, and had amassed plenty of stains on his record. He was known as a useless failure. </p><p>Even so, Huo Zhenghai still didn't have the heart to see everything he had conquered fall into the hands of an outsider. </p><p>Huo Siqian didn't have the Huo family's blood, regardless of how perfect he was. Plus, his wild ambitions had already surfaced. </p><p>It was only a matter of time before this staged father and son relationship collapsed, but it wasn't time for the final confrontation yet. </p><p>\"How is the company lately?\" Huo Zhenghai asked as he took the apple. </p><p>\"Pretty good.\" </p><p>\"I hear there's a product-ordering convention next month in France, and you've arranged Siyi to go.\" </p><p>\"Yes, he's old enough and has to take on some responsibilities. He'll start to gradually take care of the company with me.\" Huo Siqian remained smiling. </p><p>However, Huo Zhenghai grew more unsettled at the sight of this, as if there was a ticking time bomb that could explode any moment. </p><p>\"Siyi is still young and immature, so don't give him anything too important. He still doesn't have the ability yet.\" </p><p>\"No, Father, I think Siyi has been keen to learn lately. I think very highly of him.\" </p><p>Huo Zhenghai didn't know what to say, and so he chewed on the apple without another word.</p><p>\"Dad, I heard my little sister Mian came over today,\" Huo Siqian said nonchalantly, as he held the sharp fruit knife in his hands.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":218,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:33.397","Link":"Chapter-218","NameDisplay":"Chapter 218"},{"ID":181120949339498807,"Name":"Chapter 219: Cold-hearted","NameUnsign":"Chapter 219: Cold-hearted","Description":"<p>Chapter 219: Cold-hearted</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Zhenghai's hand that was holding the apple shook slightly, and then he finally sighed and purposely said, \"I'm too old now, and I've become useless. I actually began to miss that kid, Huo Mian.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, I could see that she's a really nice girl last time at Granny's funeral,\" Huo Siqian said as he smiled. </p><p>\"But that child doesn't seem to want to forgive me, no matter what. I don't even know if I can hear her call me 'dad' before I die.\" Huo Zhenghai seemed emotional. </p><p>Huo Siqian reached out his hand and patted the back of Huo Zhenghai's palm as he comforted, \"She will, dad, don't worry. Mian isn't that cold-hearted, she'll definitely come back, I promise.\" </p><p>\"Do you… know Mian well, privately?\" Huo Zhenghai inquired. </p><p>\"I really like her as a little sister, but she doesn't seem to like me. She won't even say hi when I see her. I'm really stuck, I want to approach her as an older brother and take care of her, but she won't even let me.\" </p><p>\"Oh…\" Huo Zhenghai seemed to sigh in relief. </p><p>\"What? Dad, did Mian say something to you?\" </p><p>\"No.\" </p><p>Huo Siqian only smiled and said nothing else when he saw Huo Zhenghai's expression. </p><p>On the way back, Huo Mian took her mother to a shopping center near their home, and she bought some warm fall clothes and shoes for her mother. </p><p>Yang Meirong keep saying that it was enough, but Huo Mian knew it was because she didn't want her to spend too much money. </p><p>\"Don't worry Mom, I got a new position and it pays quite well. I am capable of supporting you and Zhixin better now.\" </p><p>\"There's still no need to spend money extravagantly, earning money is still hard,\" sighed Yang Meirong. </p><p>Then, under Huo Mian's continual insistence, Yang Meirong finally agreed to eat out at a restaurant. </p><p>However, they only went to a fairly small dumpling house and ordered two plates of dumplings with a small side dish. </p><p>\"Mom, what you said today… was it really true? Did you really beg that cold-hearted man because of what had happened to Uncle Jing?\" </p><p>\"Yes, I had no other option, and I went to him with my last hints of hope.\" </p><p>\"So you went today to humiliate and taunt him, right? Do you feel better now?\" Huo Mian picked up a dumpling and placed it onto her mother's plate. </p><p>\"I'll feel better when he dies. There's too much hatred between us, but remember, Mian, I won't stop you. If you still see him as your father, you can visit him. You're you, and I'm me. I'm able to clearly distinguish that.\" </p><p>\"Mom, do you think he really wants to make things up to me?\" asked Huo Mian. </p><p>\"I didn't think he faked it... I've never seen him cry for all the years I've known him, but his eyes were completely red from the tears today. Maybe people really become kinder towards the end of their life. Maybe he's worried that he won't even hear you call him dad before he dies,\" sighed Yang Meirong. </p><p>Huo Mian looked at her mother. Then, she took a few bites and slowly said, \"Mom, this means that you're still too naïve. He's caught onto your weakness.\"</p><p>\"You don't think that his words were genuine?\" Yang Meirong was somewhat surprised. </p><p>Huo Mian bitterly smiled. \"Have you heard of crocodile tears? He purposely put on this act today for us to see. He doesn't want our forgiveness, he only wanted to get us on his side. The fact still remains that he wants to get us into the Huo family's civil war, and get us on his side to help that son and daughter of his.\" </p><p>\"But… maybe you've guessed wrong? Then wouldn't he be the one that's wronged?\" Yang Meirong thought about the previous scene once again and thought that Huo Zhenghai couldn't have faked his emotions. </p><p>\"I'm not wrong. What do you think he is, aside from being your previous lover and my father? He's the leader of a major company! What kind of tides and storms do you think he hadn't experienced? Why would he still care for sentiments? He hadn't approached us in all of these years, but now that the Huo family is undergoing a civil war, he suddenly found his conscience and wants me back as his daughter? He only saw the weakness in humanity, and he had been preparing for it since the time he called me back to attend Grandmother's funeral. There's a dark scheme behind all of this… Mom, I'm not you, and I won't be taken advantage of. You're too nice and that's why the tragedy happened. I'll reveal his true colors for you to see. I will also let him know that he's not the only one that can be cruel. He won't get his way with his scheming, and he won't ever have me as his daughter.\"</p><p>Huo Mian lowered her head and went back to eating dumplings after she finished speaking.</p><p>Yang Meirong was already shocked by what she said; she clearly knew and understood too little of her own daughter.</p><p>She would occasionally wonder if Huo Mian was truly her daughter - why would her daughter be so smart?</p><p>Such intelligence seemed scary…</p><p>At 8 PM, Huo Yanyan drove to the hospital with Shen Jiani in her sports car.</p><p>Just as they entered, Huo Yanyan immediately asked, \"Dad, how was it?

Where's Siyi?\" </p><p>\"He's preparing for the overseas business trip next month, I can see that he's trying really hard.\" Shen Jiani tried to embellish Huo Siyi's abilities in front of Huo Zhenghai. </p><p>Huo Zhenghai nodded and didn't say anything else. </p><p>He truly loved Shen Jiani, and the son and daughter of theirs. </p><p>Even though Huo Siyi was useless, and Huo Yanyan was wildly arrogant, he still saw them as his true children. </p><p>However, as for Huo Mian, the truth was, there was always a disgusting thought in his head that Huo Mian was a tainted daughter. </p><p>It was because after Yang Meirong became pregnant and failed to enter into his family, he hoped that she would obediently give birth to his child.</p><p>Instead, he never expected her to run off with that lowly driver of his, Jing De, and the two even formed their own family. </p><p>Therefore, Huo Zhenghai always thought that Yang Meirong cheated on him with Jing De when she was pregnant, and so even if Huo Mian was his own child, he still wouldn't like her. This was why he neglected the mother and daughter for all these years.</p><p>Huo Yanyan walked out of First People's Hospital with her face full of complaints,</p><p>\"Mom, when will Dad stop pretending? He isn't sick at all, but pretends that it's bad, what's the point? Will brother and I really be in trouble if we don't get help from that Huo Mian? What if she doesn't help us once she gets the shares? Or what if she helps Huo Siqian bully us? I heard that that old lady contacted Huo Mian already.\"</p><p>\"Do you think your dad is dumb? Of course he had already thought of all that. The shares might have been given to Huo Mian, but she won't have any rights to move or sell them. Plus, those shares are tied to yours, which means that as long as she returns to the Huo family and inherits her part of the share, she will have no choice but to stand on our side.\"</p><p>\"Then will she take the bait?\" Huo Yanyan was slightly worried.</p><p>\"That share is worth over a hundred million, what do you think?\" Shen Jiani was convinced that Huo Mian would take the bait, all because it had to do with money.</p><p>In her eyes, no one could ever refuse the allure of money.</p><p>For a 24-year-old girl from a poor background without much life experience and knowledge, it would take her several lifetimes to spend all of that money, so why wouldn't she agree?</p><p>If Huo Mian agrees to come back and help them, would that money really end up in Huo Mian's hands?</p><p>The answer was no. There was no way Shen Jiani would let Huo Mian have the money that, in her opinion, rightfully belonged to her daughter.</p><p>They only wanted Huo Mian back to stall time and mess up Jiang Hong's plans. Once all their plans were in place, Huo Mian would still be kicked out of the Huo family…</p><p>Sadly, they had no clue that their plans only seemed perfect in their dreams, and Huo Mian wasn't that easy to deal with.</p><p>\"Even if Huo Mian comes back, we still don't have a big chance of winning, Mom.

Some of my close girlfriends hang around a couple of Su Yu's friends, so I could definitely think of a way to get him interested in me. Plus, I'm different from those other women; I'm clean and have not been involved in scandals. Once Su Yu shows interest in me, I'll take advantage of that opportunity. Soon, not only will I be able to date Su Yu, I will also marry him. I'll get approval from the Su family, and everything will be set once I become pregnant with Su Yu's child.\"</p><p>\"That would be best.\" Shen Jiani nodded with praise.</p><p>They dreamed around but failed to even realize that Su Yu would never marry Huo Yanyan.</p><p>Even if he wanted to, Huo Siqian wouldn't agree. Siqian would never let there be an opponent that was much stronger than him to exist in his family.</p><p>Plus, Su Yu knew nothing of this; he didn't even know who Huo Yanyan was. How could she even dream of having Su Yu's children?</p><p>If Huo Mian was there, she would definitely say, \"Huo Yanyan, aren't you thinking a bit too much...\"</p><p>Huo Mian originally planned on taking time off to be with her mom. They shopped around and ate together. Finally, the two of them got onto a bus and headed home.</p><p>\"Mian, stay home tonight, I'll make you some hand-pulled noodles with mushroom meat sauce tonight,\" Yang Meirong especially emphasized.</p><p>Hand-pulled noodles with mushroom meat sauce were her mother's specialty, and it was incredibly delicious.</p><p>She would always eat three big bowls of it every time her mother made it when she was little. She would be stuffed, while Zhixin also fought for it, fearing that there wouldn't be enough.</p><p>Huo Mian felt slightly moved when she heard her mother say this, but just as she was about to agree and stay home tonight with her mother, she received a call from the hospital.</p><p>\"Mom, something just happened at the hospital, so I've to head back first.

Nannan, tell the head nurse that the patient in room one not only has a problem with his leg, he also seems to be mentally unstable.\"</p><p>After Huo Mian spoke, she walked out the front door without a care…</p><p>Nannan snuck a peek at Su Yu and noticed that his facial expression changed, again and again, turning uglier and uglier.</p><p>\"Young Master Su… do you still want kimbap?\" Nannan asked carefully.</p><p>\"Do I look like a kimbap to you?\" asked Su Yu angrily.</p><p>Nannan was so scared that she no longer dared to speak.</p><p>The bodyguards were afraid to move as well, and they stood around helplessly like robots.</p><p>Su Yu took a deep breath in and finally pressed down his fury.</p><p>\"Come, get me back inside,\" Su Yu waved at his bodyguards and then returned to his ward.</p><p>If Nannan didn't see this herself, she would never believe that Su Yu would act so calmly in front of Huo Mian's mockery.</p><p>He wasn't mad, didn't threaten to file complaints or toss glass bottles at Huo Mian's head.</p><p>Could this mean that Huo Mian was the force that countered Su Yu? Everything had its weakness, right?</p><p>This shocked even the head nurse, Song Lin…</p><p>And because of this, they were more polite to Huo Mian, because she could take care of any patient.</p><p>The grandpa in room 2 now voluntarily followed his diet restrictions and no longer ate food behind others, because Huo Mian threatened that she wouldn't play chess with him.</p><p>In no more than half a month, Huo Mian had become quite famous at South Side.</p><p>This quickly got around…</p><p>Su Yu sat on his bed, and instead of being angry, he smiled when he thought of what just happened…</p><p>Since he was born, no one had ever dared to ask if he was intellectually challenged; Huo Mian was the first.</p><p>He turned on his phone and flipped out the video of Huo Mian at the entrance of the First Hospital from a while back.</p><p>A naïve-looking girl like that was able to calmly settle a medical scandal with a few words, in front of all of the media.</p><p>Su Yu thought she was very special; she could speak so calmly and also had such a soothing voice.</p><p>The video stopped at the image of Huo Mian smiling at the press…</p><p>Su Yu pressed pause, and he looked at the image on his phone as the corners of his mouth lifted up into a smile, \"Huo…Mian, huh, very good. My life became much more interesting after you appeared, I look forward to this.\"</p><p>Huo Mian noticed that Qin Chu was already home because the lights in the study were on.</p><p>She took off her jacket and went upstairs with a cup of coffee. Knocked on the door, Huo Mian asked with a smile, \"Hi, Mr. Qin, would you like some coffee?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":222,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:35.797","Link":"Chapter-222","NameDisplay":"Chapter 222"},{"ID":181120949362904456,"Name":"Chapter 223: Opinion","NameUnsign":"Chapter 223: Opinion","Description":"<p>Chapter 223: Opinion</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>The second Qin Chu turned around to look at Huo Mian, his eyes immediately grew gentler… </p><p>\"No need for coffee, can I eat tofu instead?\" Qin Chu always had a serious face on, even if he was joking. (TL note: In Chinese, 'eating tofu' is also a slang for second base)</p><p>Huo Mian then blushed and walked over. She placed the coffee by his mouse, and flicked his head with her fingers, \"Don't get distracted when you're working, or else you really don't deserve to be GK's president.\"  </p><p>\"Didn't you say that you were staying over there on WeChat?\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, \"That's what I planned, but something happened at the hospital and I had to get back. It was already late after I took care of it, and Mom sleeps early so I didn't want to wake her up. Plus, I have to work tomorrow anyway.\" </p><p>\"Okay, have you eaten yet?\" </p><p>\"I had some food at the hospital, you?\" </p><p>\"I didn't, but I'm not hungry,\" President Qin said as he looked at the documents on his computer screen.</p><p>Huo Mian stood beside him and looked at the documents curiously. </p><p>There were three photos of rings… it might be because they were only initial drafts, they didn't look very pleasing yet. </p><p>Qin Chu looked at them carefully while smoothly putting his hands around her waist, holding her lightly. </p><p>Then, he inhaled her unique scent and suddenly felt much happier. </p><p>\"These are the rings the company is going to release next month, which one do you think is the best?\" asked Qin Chu. </p><p>\"I'm not an expert, you should pick one yourself.\" Huo Mian smiled. </p><p>\"I trust your judgment, so help me pick one.\" After staring at them for the whole night, Qin Chu was quite frustrated. </p><p>Three different people designed these rings. The first half-moon shaped ring held stars inside, and was designed by Jiang Linyue, which was called, 'Stars Raise the Moon'.</p><p>Little girls probably all like this dreamy design… </p><p>A young chief designer in their southern subsidiary company designed the second. It was a broken tear shape, both romantic and sad, named, 'Tears of the Devil'. </p><p>The third was in the shape of a burning flame and had a complex design, which might shock others with its beauty. </p><p>A new designer from the overseas headquarters proposed this daring design, and those were the three that came out on top from tens of thousands of submissions. </p><p>As the president, Qin Chu had to personally select one as the primary product, and then officially announce it to the rest of the world. </p><p>After spending an entire night with the designs, he found advantages and disadvantages to all three, so he was being very indecisive. </p><p>Huo Mian just happened to be back, so he asked for her opinion. </p><p>She earnestly slouched over, looked at the computer, and said, \"Then I'll tell you what I think, but don't laugh at me.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Qin Chu's hand unconsciously clasped Huo Mian's waist tighter, as if he was scared that she would run away. </p><p>\"The first design is somewhat traditional, but there's nothing wrong with being conservative to go with taking the traditional approach with jewelry. It's a luxury product, and consumers might be scared to try newer designs, so many people would make the most conservative choice. The image of moon and stars is very dreamy, and little girls will love that, so there's a great market for it.\" </p><p>President Qin nodded… </p><p>Huo Mian continued, \"The second one is interesting, the designer must be an artist because the work perfectly portrayed all of the wounds inside his heart, but there may not be many people who will understand it. Tears are already sad enough, so shattered tears represents endless sadness. I'm sure it'll look amazing when the product comes out, but not many people will understand it, and so they won't buy this, no matter how interesting it is. However, it would be a pity if this doesn't exist at all, so I think you could manufacture a few, and sell it as a limited edition.\" </p><p>Qin Chu nodded with approval. \"Not bad, go on.\"</p><p>\"I personally like the last one the most. The design is daring, and the product is shockingly attractive, but it must be difficult to manufacture a design as complicated as this one. If the cost of production is too high, consumers might not want to pay a higher price, and in the end, they will only look at it, rather than buy it. So, I suggest that you get a model to wear it first, and once it has been properly marketed, the design could be sold in stores. Once a customer wants to buy it, you can begin manufacturing it after a deposit is paid. In conclusion, the first design suits the general public, while the other two should be treated as limited edition luxury items that only a few can buy, what do you think?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":223,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:36.29","Link":"Chapter-223","NameDisplay":"Chapter 223"},{"ID":181120949368362122,"Name":"Chapter 224: Tofu","NameUnsign":"Chapter 224: Tofu","Description":"<p>Chapter 224: Tofu</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"I thought the same, but the first design is far too conservative. With GK's current brand identity, we will be laughed at by the market if the new designs we propose are not creative enough. Of course, profit is important for a business, but so is its reputation. So, I plan on pushing forward the third design as the primary product. As you said, the second would be limited edition, while the first would be promoted as inexpensive jewelry and used to attract the general public.\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded in agreement, as she thought that Qin Chu would always be right. </p><p>\"I suddenly feel hungry now, I want to eat something,\" Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian, as his hands moved around her waist. </p><p>\"If you're hungry, tofu won't be enough to fill you up,\" Huo Mian pushed his hands away and replied with a smile. </p><p>\"Tofu is definitely enough for me, I just happen to like it,\" Qin Chu protested. </p><p>There were hints of bitterness in his eyes as well…</p><p>To his surprise, Huo Mian nodded, \"There's tofu in our fridge, I'll make some for you.\" </p><p>Huo Mian then turned around to head downstairs after she finished her sentence.</p><p>Qin Chu felt helpless. He didn't actually mean tofu when he said tofu, and she clearly got it but only pretended that she didn't. </p><p>What kind of woman did he marry? She looked like a bunny but was actually as smart as a fox. </p><p>Half an hour later, Huo Mian called Qin Chu down for dinner. </p><p>She made a mushroom meat stir-fry, a vegetable tofu soup, and two egg pancakes. </p><p>Clearly, Huo Mian's cooking immediately stimulated Qin Chu's appetite. </p><p>The two sat across from each other, and Huo Mian handed him a glass of water. </p><p>Qin Chu ate with great appetite… </p><p>\"Huo Zhenghai was sick, and I visited him with mom today.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>\"He wants me to go back and said he left me some shares of the company, but I think he only did so to deal with Huo Siqian. He is unable to control the situation, so he had to think of me. He even put on a show for Mom and me.\" </p><p>\"Your mom must have bought it, right?\" guessed Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Yes, she's still sentimental. After all, she's a normal woman, so she seemed to be slightly moved by it. But after she heard my predictions, she believed me. I think that Huo Zhenghai only asked to see my mom and me for his own personal gains, I won't be tricked by his lies.\" </p><p>\"He seemed capable of doing that. He never asked or even mentioned you for all these years, but even now, he still plans on using you. How surreal it must be to have a dad like that.\" Qin Chu really despised the Huo family, only because they have never treated Huo Mian nicely. </p><p>Whoever treated Huo Mian badly would always be Qin Chu's enemy… </p><p>\"Yes, so I've always kept my attitude firm. I won't help him, even if he calls me daddy.\"</p><p>Qin Chu broke into laughter...</p><p>His wife will occasionally say the cutest things!</p><p>\"What are you laughing about? I was talking about a serious subject with you. It's not the time for you to laugh.\" Huo Mian was speechless.</p><p>\"So, honey, you must be exhausted after a day of work, but you still have to worry about these things. Should I do something for you?\"</p><p>\"Do what?\"</p><p>\"Like, give you a full-body massage to release your tensions… or we could do some meaningful exercise, to help you forget these worries temporarily.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was overwhelmed with embarrassment when Qin Chu spoke so explicitly about his intentions.</p><p>\"I don't need a full-body massage, but you could always give me more money. If I have more money, I won't be tempted by Huo Zhenghai's shares, and he won't be able to get his way.\"</p><p>\"I have a solution.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Huo Mian raised her head to look at Qin Chu, not knowing what kind of idea he concocted in his mind this time.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":224,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:36.837","Link":"Chapter-224","NameDisplay":"Chapter 224"},{"ID":181120949373354249,"Name":"Chapter 225: Allowance","NameUnsign":"Chapter 225: Allowance","Description":"<p>Chapter 225: Allowance</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You can come work at GK as the deputy CEO.

I will have you know that I am sincerely trying to headhunt you.

This position is relatively easy, and it pays well too,\" Huo Mian joked.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't say much else as he already knew Huo Mian wouldn't come to GK. He was just joking around with her. </p><p>After their meal, Huo Mian went upstairs and took a shower. After she came out from the bathroom, she checked her phone and noticed that she received a text message. </p><p>She was dumbstruck by the content of the message. </p><p>\"Fifty million yuan has been transferred to your ICBC account ending in 1040. Your current balance is fifty-three million and six thousand yuan.\" </p><p>Fifty-three million yuan? </p><p>She knew where the three million yuan came from, it was Qin Chu's monthly income of one million for the last three month. </p><p>But what was the deal with the fifty million yuan? </p><p>She got up immediately to find Qin Chu watching the financial news downstairs. </p><p>\"Did you just transfer money into my account?\" </p><p>\"It wasn't me...\" </p><p>\"No way!\" Huo Mian interjected immediately. </p><p>Who else would transfer such a large sum of money to her? </p><p>\"Didn't you say you wanted to oppose the Huo Corporation? I'm providing you with some funding for now in preparation.\" </p><p>\"Are you kidding me? It's too much, I don't want all this money.\" </p><p>\"Just take it. In case your hubby goes bankrupt, you can use this capital to help me rebuild my empire,\" Qin Chu said casually as he sipped on a cup of tea as if he was speaking of five hundred yuan as opposed to fifty million yuan. </p><p>So there were truly men who would spoil their wives like this? In the millions? </p><p>Huo Mian didn't know what to think, so, was she a rich woman now? </p><p>It was sudden of Qin Chu to transfer her so much money, but with such a good reason, it was difficult for her to refuse. </p><p>She couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed with emotions, so she posted a status on her Wechat friend circle.</p><p>She wrote, \"If a woman is with you for the money, then give her enough of it and she will leave you alone despite you being intimate with another woman. If a woman was with you for the relationship, then give her enough love and security and she won't look down on you for not having money. But, if you are unable to provide money or love, and you expect her to forgive your faithlessness, laziness, and lies, then I'm sorry, you don't need a girlfriend, you need an idiot.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling liked her status as soon as she finished posting it. </p><p>She then called Huo Mian, \"Hey girl, not bad! I think your status is totally up my alley. I definitely benefited lots from it.\" </p><p>\"Nah, you're thinking too much. I saw it on Weibo and thought it was funny, so I reposted it.\" Huo Mian explained. </p><p>\"Ha, I know. I'm just kidding with you! Have you been busy recently? I don't see you on Wechat very often now.\"</p><p>\"Yes, lots of messes to clean up after I was transferred over to the South Side Recuperation Center.\" </p><p>\"Let's go out for a drink!\"</p><p>\"No problem! But Qin Chu can't know about it, or else he will choke me to death.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry, I won't choke you to death. I have better ways to deal with you.\" Qin Chu walked into the room without Huo Mian noticing.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately hung up the phone out of fear.</p><p>\"Mr. Qin, it's not a good habit to eavesdrop on others' phone conversations.\"</p><p>\"So, you going out drinking behind my back is a good habit?\" Qin Chu stared at Huo Mian as he crossed his arms and leaned against the door.</p><p>Huo Mian felt a little guilty...</p><p>\"I was just… saying that to Lingling.\"</p><p>\"Oh, lying to friends is a really good habit,\" Qin Chu intentionally emphasized.</p><p>Huo Mian was instantly speechless... </p><p>She thought about it for a moment and walked over slowly. She draped her arms around Qin Chu's neck and whined, \"Master Qin! If I were to give you a kiss, will you let me go out for a drink?\"</p><p>Before Qin Chu had the time to respond, Huo Mian lifted her head, puckered her lips, and gave him a kiss.</p><p>Huo Mian, did you get drunk behind my back already?!

She looked rather seductive…</p><p>\"So, Master Qin. Can I go out and have a drink with Lingling now?\" Huo Mian stared at Qin Chu with her big eyes. </p><p>\"What a honey-trap… you're good,\" Qin Chu stared at Huo Mian's face and answered. </p><p>Huo Mian chuckled loudly, clearly amused... </p><p>\"Did Zhu Lingling teach you this?\" Qin Chu questioned. </p><p>\"You think she's more intelligent than me?\" Huo Mian questioned back. </p><p>Qin Chu bit his tongue... </p><p>\"Qin Chu?\" </p><p>\"Huh?\" </p><p>\"Can I go out and drink just this once? I won't drink too much, just a couple of glasses!

I get worried if you go out at night.\" </p><p>After laying down the ground rules, they both went to bed.</p><p>- Next morning - </p><p>Huo Mian drove to work and had just punched in her time card before a coworker came up to her. \"Huo Mian, someone's looking for you.\" </p><p>Who could be so annoying that they actually came to bother her at work? Huo Mian wondered.</p><p>Just then, a flaming red shadow appeared in front of her. The shadow was in a red dress, with a pair of red heels that looked to be seven-inches tall. She was rather flashy and flamboyant.</p><p>\"Huo Yanyan?\" Huo Mian furrowed her brows.</p><p>With a full face of delicately-applied makeup and hair down to her shoulders, who else could it be?</p><p>Despite the fact that Huo Yanyan dressed flamboyantly, she nevertheless came from the Huo family. The way she held herself still gave a great sense of presence. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, let's talk.\"</p><p>\"I'm working,\" Huo Mian coldly replied.</p><p>She was never really fond of anyone in the Huo family.</p><p>\"It's not like you earn much with this job anyways. You can take a one-hour break, and I will give you three times the pay,\" Huo Yanyan said all mightily.</p><p>\"Is this enough?\" She asked arrogantly as she pulled out a dozen bills from her LV handbag.</p><p>For a second, Huo Mian wanted to take the money and toss it at her face, then tell her that she had fifty million yuan in her account so she could stuff that money up somewhere where the sun don't shine.</p><p>But of course, Huo Mian would never do that; she was not someone with no manners.</p><p>\"Forget the money. What do you want? Give me the TL:DR version, I'm busy.\" Huo Mian looked at Huo Yanyan.</p><p>\"This is not a good place to talk. Let's go somewhere else,\" Huo Yanyan looked at the busy doorway and suggested.</p><p>So, Huo Mian took her to the hospital's back garden...</p><p>\"What is it,\" Huo Mian said harshly.</p><p>\"My father's sick. Did you know that?\" Huo Yanyan emphasized 'my father', reminding Huo Mian of her identity.</p><p>\"Your point?\" Huo Mian was getting impatient.</p><p>\"The point is, my father hasn't been well. He still thinks of you as his daughter, and he wants you to come home. You don't have to live in our house, but you have the right to inherit some shares from my father. I hope you know that those shares are worth quite a bit. Well, it's not like you would understand it even if I explain it to you. But, you need to know that my father is being very kind for giving you a chance to become rich. So, to return his favor, you need to be on the same team as us against Huo Siqian. Do you understand?\"</p><p>\"Why would I?\" Huo Mian provoked.</p><p>\"You will do it because there's no such thing as a free lunch, if you're taking the shares then you need to help.\"</p><p>\"I don't want those shares, so I definitely won't help you.\"</p><p>\"What?

After all, you're a socialite.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, don't be a b*tch. What my father is doing is called pitying you, because you're so goddamn poor. Not only that, you have that burdensome little brother of yours. Didn't you have to work several different jobs, including at KFC, to support him through school? Oh yes, let's not forget your crazy mother. She failed in marrying rich, so she ran off with my father's chauffeur. She then tried to blackmail my father when you guys ran out of money. When that didn't succeed, she went around spreading rumors that my father is unfaithful. Your whole family is messed up in the head. I know she owns a little convenience store for a living, so, so quit putting up a front when you guys are all so poor already. I see you're driving a Volkswagen now, did you lease it? Is it secondhand? Or have you gotten yourself a sugar daddy now? Huh?\" </p><p>Clearly, Huo Yanyan was a very vicious person. Not only that, she was extremely snobby and had always looked down on the poor.</p><p>Back when Huo Yanyan was still in school, it was rumored that a fellow classmate really liked her. However, both parents of the boy were civil servants, so his family background was average. She would always give the boy a hard time in front of all the other classmates and call him a toad to suggest that she was out of his league. In the end, the boy jumped off from the third floor because he couldn't take it anymore. Luckily, he only broke his leg, but what did all of that say about Huo Yanyan's character?</p><p>\"Are you done farting? If you are, then get the hell out. I can't help but gag if I have to look at you for another minute.\"</p><p>\"What did you just say?\" Huo Yanyan was obviously very surprised.</p><p>\"You should really value the fact that you came from a good family and live a life of abundance. If you keep on living beyond your means, you will one day drown like a mouse. You shouldn't be so unkind, or you will be doomed by nature,\" Huo Mian said calmly.</p><p>\"Who are you saying will be doomed by nature? Huo Mian, you're just jealous of me. You're envious of the fact that I am the Huo family's legitimate daughter, and you, you're just a lowly nurse.\" </p><p>\"Miss Huo Yanyan, do you have paranoia? What fuels your superiority complex? Why would I be jealous of you? Do you look like Zhang Manyu or Lin Qingxia? Is your husband Liang Chaowei or Li Zekai? (TL note: These are well-known celebrities in China, equivalent to Angelina Jolie or Leonardo DiCaprio) Out of the three of you, other than the fact that your mom got some brain cells, you and your little brother are practically mentally challenged. I sincerely recommend that you go and munch on some walnuts when you're bored to boost your brain. Aren't you afraid that people will laugh at your intelligence? Oh, and by the way, the fact that you guys are still alive, being the way you guys are, is only because Huo Siqian allowed you guys to live. What a soft-hearted person.\" </p><p>Huo Mian turned on her heel and walked away when she finished speaking... </p><p>\"Huo Mian, come back here! Who's got no f*cking brain?\" Huo Yanyan was furious. </p><p>But Huo Mian already left, leaving her no chance to retaliate... </p><p>Huo Yanyan was going to make a scene at the hospital, but she was afraid that the media would catch on and, in turn, ruin her image. </p><p>On the way back, in her sports car, she was filled with anger. </p><p>She then made an extremely daring decision without consulting with her mother. </p><p>She made a call to a reporter that she knew. That night at 8 PM, the reporter revealed Huo Mian's identity as a bastard daughter on Weibo (TL note: a major social media platform in China). The reporter deliberately described her and her mother as a vicious pair who hankered after the Huo family's wealth. Despite knowing that Mr. Huo was sick, they only cared about the amount of money they could receive.  </p><p>At the same time, others assumed that Huo Mian got away with the previous incident because she was the Huo family's bastard daughter. </p><p>The report also mentioned that Huo Mian had a good relationship with Huo Siqian, so the incident was very likely taken care of by him.</p><p>All the information provided was very exaggerated, but nonetheless, many still believed it.</p><p>Later that night when Huo Yanyan finally got home from the club after a night of partying, Shen Jiani asked unhappily, \"Yanyan, were you the one who revealed Huo Mian's identity?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":227,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:38.357","Link":"Chapter-227","NameDisplay":"Chapter 227"},{"ID":181120949388846169,"Name":"Chapter 228: Exposed","NameUnsign":"Chapter 228: Exposed","Description":"<p>Chapter 228: Exposed</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Yes. Not bad, eh? It's fine if that bitch doesn't want to help us, I will make sure her reputation becomes foul. Now that everything's been exposed, she will be pressured to admit her relationship with my father, so eventually, she will come back to inherit the shares.\" </p><p>\"Don't be so foolish, what are you going to do if she takes Huo Siqian's side?\" </p><p>\"Oh, then it will be easy! We'll just get someone to kill her off and have the lawyer press her fingerprint on the documents before she dies. That way, the shares can be transferred to us,\" Huo Yanyan said nonchalantly as she reeked with the smell of alcohol.</p><p>\"That's a stupid idea! You're still too young and naive. You should use your brain more!\" Shen Jiani was very furious, but she didn't have the heart to slap her daughter across the face. </p><p>- Within the VIP room of the South Side Recuperation Center -</p><p>Su Yu glanced over at Weibo's trending topic and smiled to himself. The Huo family's bastard daughter? That's an interesting identity.</p><p>But this was not Huo Mian's only secret… there's more going on, Su Yu thought to himself.  </p><p>While everything was happening, Huo Mian was still working the night shift.</p><p>She didn't go on Weibo to look at the news until everyone, including Lingling, Zhixin, Huang Yue, and the head nurse at the First Hospital called to check up on her.</p><p>It was difficult for Huo Mian to imagine Huo Yanyan being so idiotic. Even though Huo Yanyan wanted to give her a hard time, she didn't have to do something so amazingly stupid.</p><p>Huo Mian must have angered Huo Yanyan so much during the day that made her want to force Huo Mian to admit her relationship to Huo Zhenghai.</p><p>They wouldn't accept her in the beginning, but now they were practically forcing and begging her to accept her identity. These people from the Huo family were all certainly pieces of work, and they had no idea how the word shame was spelled.  </p><p>\"Hey girl, you okay?\" Zhu Lingling messaged Huo Mian out of worry. </p><p>\"I'm great.\" </p><p>\"Who did this? It's so terrible.\" </p><p>\"Huo Yanyan.\" </p><p>\"I should go find her with you and beat the shit out of that little b*tch. She's been pissing me off for a while now.\" </p><p>\"It's fine, I won't do that. What she did to me has no positive impact for her. Just wait for it, she'll regret it.\" </p><p>On the contrary, Huo Mian appeared more nervous by the fact that others were worried about her... </p><p>While she was busy messaging Zhu Lingling, Qin Chu's call sprung up on her phone. </p><p>\"Hello?\" </p><p>\"Are you okay?\" By the sound of it, Qin Chu was very worried. </p><p>\"You saw the Weibo posts too?\" Huo Mian smiled bitterly. She never wanted to look for trouble, because she knew Qin Chu would always be the one cleaning up after her. </p><p>But so far, she had been nothing but trouble... </p><p>\"Yeah. I've already gotten someone to shut this down. I will take care of everything else. Don't worry, okay?\" </p><p>\"I'm fine.\" </p><p>\"Are you working the night shift tonight?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"I will go find you.\" </p><p>\"No, it's okay. South Side forbids family visits, and they're really strict about it. You don't need to come, just stay at home and wait for me. I will bring some breakfast home tomorrow morning, what do you want to eat?\" Huo Mian smiled slightly. </p><p>In moments like this, it was clear that Huo Mian was very calm and intelligent as she was still able to speak casually of breakfast, as opposed to being an anxious mess.  </p><p>\"I'll prepare breakfast and wait for you at home.\" Qin Chu hung up the phone as soon as he finished speaking.</p><p>Later that evening, the emergency alarm in room one went off when Huo Mian was busy preparing files. From the moment she heard the ringing, she knew Su Yu did it on purpose. </p><p>His room was always full of women and bodyguards, so what kind of emergency could he possibly be in?</p><p>She took her sweet time and went over after several minutes. </p><p>\"What is it?\" She walked in and leaned against the doorway casually. </p><p>\"I want a glass of water, pour me some.\" </p><p>\"Do you not have arms? You hurt your leg, not your arm, okay?\" Huo Mian shot back. </p><p>\"Someone's feisty! Looks like your temper is worse now that you're associated with the Huo family,\" Su Yu commented. </p><p>After hearing what Su Yu said, Huo Mian's eyes glimmered. She then turned around and answered as she poured some water, \"Wrong. My temper has always been this bad for the past 24 years, during which the Huo family refused to accept me. It has nothing to do with who I'm associated with\" </p><p>Huo Mian passed over the glass of water and turned on her heel to leave…</p><p>\"Huo Mian.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Huo Mian looked back.</p><p>\"If you beg me, I can take care of this within a minute. \" Su Yu held the glass of water in his hand and looked at Huo Mian arrogantly.</p><p>Of course, he wasn't boasting. It was an easy fix for Su Yu.</p><p>\"Oh, thanks. If you drink less water, piss less, and stop breathing, I will be very grateful.\"</p><p>To no one's surprise, she wouldn't ask for help, no matter what kind of situation she was in.</p><p>Su Yu really admired her stubborn personality, but at the same time, he was also a little mad that she wouldn't beg him.</p><p>As a woman, there were times when you needed to be tender and tame.</p><p>Huo Mian's phone kept ringing after she got back to the on-call station.</p><p>When she picked up the phone, the first sentence Zhixin asked her was, \"Sis, are you planning to go back to the Huo family?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":228,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:38.883","Link":"Chapter-228","NameDisplay":"Chapter 228"},{"ID":181120949394997739,"Name":"Chapter 229: Questioning","NameUnsign":"Chapter 229: Questioning","Description":"<p>Chapter 229: Questioning</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Where did you hear that from?\" </p><p>\"I didn't hear it from anyone, I just saw it on the news. No one came looking for you after all these years, and now they're making such a scene. For a family that cares so much about their image, they will probably come and find you because of the pressure from media.\" </p><p>\"Zhixin, do you want me to go back?\" </p><p>Jing Zhixin bit his tongue after hearing his sister ask him. He then said in sorrow, \"To be honest, I don't want you to go back. But, if it's what you want, then I won't stop you. I will try to convince mom for you. I've said it before, and I will say it again, I will always respect your decisions.\" </p><p>\"Don't try to be a hero, kiddo. Plus, I'm not a snob. Going back my a*s! The people in the Huo family are all wolves. I'm already exhausted from working, and then when I go home I will have to fight them to my wit's end. Why don't you sit back and relax? That way I won't have to worry about you too.\" </p><p>\"Sis, what's the situation? Can I help?\" Zhixin asked warily as he read between the lines. </p><p>\"No, it's fine. Just go to school and be a good kid. Don't make Mom and I worry.\"</p><p>\"I understand.\" </p><p>\"Okay, I'm going to get changed now and get ready to leave work. I'll talk to you later.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Zhixin listened to his sister and hung up the phone. </p><p>This brother of hers was actually a considerate and protective man already. Even though he was still young and couldn't really help her much, he was always the first one to provide moral support whenever she needed help. Zhixin was always able to make her feel better and encouraged her through words. </p><p>After all these years, she and Zhixin had developed a great bond, sometimes even closer than that of biological siblings. </p><p>She hoped Zhixin would grow up quickly to become a man. She knows that it will be an emotional day to see him start his own family. </p><p>But then, she also wished that time would slow down a little, because as soon as Zhixin entered society, he will have to take on many responsibilities from his job as well as from his family. </p><p>By then, he may not be so innocent anymore... </p><p>Due to the sudden incident, Huo Mian left work early after changing. She thought it was important that she dealt with the incident, so she asked the head nurse for some time off. </p><p>Su Yu had no idea that there was a shift-swap during the night. </p><p>At 10 PM, he pressed the alarm requesting for water.</p><p>His face dimmed as another nurse walked in, \"Is Huo Mian not working tonight?\"</p><p>\"Young Master Su, Huo Mian's had a family emergency so she went home.\" The little nurse was quite afraid and didn't dare to speak up. </p><p>\"Get out.\" Su Yu waved his hands at the nurse. He had trouble falling asleep, so he began flipping through his phone and reading the news. </p><p>There was much more negative press after the exposure of Huo Mian's identity.</p><p>Someone opened a smurf account on a local forum and questioned the reality of what happened in the last incident between the hospital and the pregnant patient. Did Huo Mian use her family background to obstruct the truth? </p><p>Haters gonna hate, so naturally, the situation became worse. On the other side at the First Hospital, the press surrounded the entrance, yet no one in sight came out to provide an explanation.</p><p>It was the same situation at South Side, but clearly, Huo Mian wasn't going to walk out and respond to the incident. </p><p>Su Yu was curious to see how Huo Mian was going to handle this situation. </p><p>Would she go back to the Huo Family with her title and inherit a share of that pot of gold? Or, was she going to keep being herself? </p><p>By the time Huo Mian got home, Qin Chu was still at work. </p><p>He seemed very busy recently. Huo Mian didn't have the appetite to eat dinner, so she took a quick shower and went to bed. </p><p>As for the news, she was too lazy to care and didn't want to bother with it. </p><p>But it was Lingling who couldn't bear it any longer and called in to ask how she was. She explained the situation with a few simple sentences.</p><p>Just as she hung up the phone with Lingling, another familiar number called in.</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Hello, Little Sis. Looks like someone's trying to force your return. Have you decided what you're going to do? Do you need your big brother to help you out a little?\" Huo Siqian still sounded frivolous as usual.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":229,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:39.5","Link":"Chapter-229","NameDisplay":"Chapter 229"},{"ID":181120949399979865,"Name":"Chapter 230: Help","NameUnsign":"Chapter 230: Help","Description":"<p>Chapter 230: Help</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"That's not necessary.\" Huo Mian refused as soon as Huo Siqian offered to help. </p><p>\"There's no shame in asking. If you let the incident play out on its own, you will be harmed much more than them. Even if you decide to be unresponsive, they won't stop until they get what they want. They will keep trying to smoke you out. Instead of being so passive, we can work together and get rid of them.\" </p><p>\"Mr. Huo is not dead yet, so no need to try to get ahead and start fantasizing,\" Huo Mian coldly reminded him. </p><p>\"I know. This has nothing to do with Dad. Right now, he won't come out directly to deal with this and will only watch in the dark. I'm guessing this incident wasn't thought out by Shen Jiani. Based on how brainless this incident is, it was probably done by Huo Yanyan.\" </p><p>Huo Mian thought so too, but she replied with silence. </p><p>Based on how the conversation between Huo Yanyan and her went down during the day at the hospital, Huo Yanyan would have the biggest motive. </p><p>By going public with such a scandal, it would bring a lot of hardship onto Huo Mian's daily life. They were also using the power of the negative press to force Huo Mian to make a decision.</p><p>She could either go back to the Huo family and accept her identity... </p><p>Or leave the Huo family, and never go back. </p><p>Initially, it was easy for her to choose. But now, Huo Zhenghai was rumored to be gravely sick. People would label her as an ungrateful and vicious brat if she ruthlessly refused to go back. </p><p>Huo Mian knew that this was a trap. The road ahead would be difficult regardless of what she chose to do. </p><p>Not to mention, she was powerless compared to Huo Yanyan and her family. She had no resources or networks. </p><p>Unless Qin Chu would make his move... </p><p>But she really didn't want Qin Chu's help. She had always considered herself to be strong and self-sufficient, and she couldn't possibly always live in the safe bubble that Qin Chu provided for her.</p><p>\"No good will come out of it for Huo Yanyan. I'm not that weak, and I won't give up easily. It's too early for them to think they've won. I still have undealt cards.\" </p><p>\"Nice. That's very brave of you. There's no comparison between you and Huo Yanyan. If we're speaking of pure intelligence, just based on weight, your brain would be heavier than hers by three pounds. However, this incident has brought on a lot of trouble for you. Just like last time, you will be living under the scrutiny of the public eye even though you are not a public figure, which is completely unfair to you.\"</p><p>In reality, Huo Siqian felt a little sorry for Huo Mian, for he knew that she didn't live much of a good life all these years.</p><p>He had always wanted to help her, but she would always push him away.</p><p>\"Fair? Young Master Huo, do you know how hilarious you sound for saying that? There's no such thing as fairness in this world. Huo Yanyan is also a bastard child, the same as me - born from a mistress. Yet, she lives a life of abundance as if she deserves it, and me? I've lived with nothing all these years, nothing except for ridicule and abuse. So, where is the fairness you are speaking of?\"</p><p>\"If that's the case, you should take revenge. Give the people that started this a taste of their own medicine.\" </p><p>\"I'm not interested in revenge, but I will teach Huo Yanyan a lesson or two for sure. However, I won't cooperate with you. I've said it once and I'll say it again, I won't be involved in your family feud, so don't try to recruit me.\" </p><p>\"I've said nothing of it so far, so you don't need to worry,\" Huo Siqian chuckled. He found it interesting that Huo Mian could be so silly and cute at the same time.  </p><p>\"If you have no other business, I'm hanging up.\" </p><p>\"Mian.\" His voice was suddenly soft and tender. </p><p>Huo Mian listened in silence... </p><p>\"Mian, if you can't take it anymore, you can come to me, and I will definitely help you. You shouldn't expect much from your Qin Chu. Don't put your hopes on someone who had abandoned you before. Do you understand?' </p><p>Huo Mian hung up the phone as soon as he finished speaking. </p><p>No wonder Qin Chu called him a weirdo, he indeed had a sick brain. </p><p>She wanted to correct him that Qin Chu never abandoned her, it was her who broke up with him seven years ago. </p><p>Seven years later, it was Qin Chu who took the initiative and steered this relationship back onto its track. Qin Chu never owed her anything. </p><p>There were too many external factors and obstacles between them... and that was why they hadn't been able to live the life they wanted together. </p><p>Late at night, Qin Chu came home from working overtime. He walked into the bedroom and noticed that Huo Mian was deep asleep. </p><p>He stared at her face and kissed her forehead gently.</p><p>Huo Mian turned around and tightly hugged Qin Chu by his neck...</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":230,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:40","Link":"Chapter-230","NameDisplay":"Chapter 230"},{"ID":181120949405709484,"Name":"Chapter 231: Cheating","NameUnsign":"Chapter 231: Cheating","Description":"<p>Chapter 231: Cheating</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Qin Chu was startled, he thought she had woken up but found no movement after a while. </p><p>He looked down and found her still deep asleep. </p><p>How calm was his wife to be able to sleep when things blew up like this? He sighed and wondered. </p><p>For Huo Mian to be sleeping so soundly, she definitely had to be pretty mentally strong.</p><p>In the end, Qin Chu laid down beside Huo Mian and wrapped her in his arms like a precious treasure, unwilling to let go for even a second. </p><p>\"Don't worry, no one can harm you.\" Qin Chu's voice was soft and raspy, filled with infatuation and love. </p><p>As if she sensed something in her dream, Huo Mian buried her face deeper in Qin Chu 's chest. </p><p>Qin Chu lifted his arm to untangle and straighten out her hair. He was very gentle, scared to wake her. </p><p>The next morning, Qin Chu left early as he had to drive out for an off-site visit. </p><p>By the time Huo Mian woke up, Qin Chu was nowhere to be found, but breakfast was prepared and ready. </p><p>Sometimes, she felt that they were living together like roommates.</p><p>Sometimes, they would go days without seeing each other. How could they enjoy their newly-wed romance when both of them left early in the morning and came home late at night? </p><p>She thought to herself as she took a sip of milk and sent a WeChat message to Qin Chu. </p><p>\"Your whereabouts lately have been strange. Are you cheating on me? Do you have yourself a sugar baby or two?\" </p><p>Qin Chu's reply came in just as she was putting down her phone. It was an instant reply. </p><p>\"If I did, what would you do? Would you be mad?\" Qin Chu asked back.</p><p>Huo Mian couldn't tell his tone through the text, so she couldn't identify if he was kidding or half serious. </p><p>\"As long as I, the empress, never dies, they will only ever be concubines.\" </p><p>\"I thought you would divorce me and let me go,\" Qin Chu replied to her after a while. </p><p>\"Is that what you want?\" Huo Mian asked carefully, probing for his reactions.  </p><p>\"No, I won't divorce you. Even if the day comes where you no longer love me, I still won't divorce you. I've been captured by one person this whole life, and that person's name is 'Huo Mian'.\" </p><p>Initially, she was just kidding around. Now, Huo Mian didn't know what she should do after hearing such an affectionate confession. </p><p>She couldn't help her heart from speeding up like crazy. Her face felt burning, and for a moment, she felt like a teenage girl who was getting asked out for the first time. </p><p>\"Ha, I'm just kidding! Why would I divorce you, you've invested so much in me. It would be a big loss to get a divorce. Oh right, you've been really busy recently! Did you eat breakfast yet? Don't just worry about me, take care of yourself as well.\" </p><p>Huo Mian quickly changed the subject... </p><p>\"There's been a complicated case at work, I need to visit the site daily and attend meetings.\" </p><p>\"Okay, it's about time for me to go to work too.\" </p><p>Huo Mian went downstairs and drove to work after she finished messaging Qin Chu. </p><p>She was careful to avoid the many reporters waiting outside the hospital. </p><p>- Inside the nurses' on-call station -</p><p>Many nurses crowded around Huo Mian.

However, Young Master Su's situation is not so well. He's kicking out all the other nurses. He hasn't had his medicine for a couple of days, nor did he have any transfusions done. Even the reassessment has been canceled. I believe the situation would be much more different if you were to tend to him. After all, you're the only nurse that was successful in giving him injections.\" </p><p>\"So I'm guessing you want me to go and take care of him?\" Huo Mian didn't feel like going.</p><p>\"I'm just mentioning the situation to you, and it's fine if you don't want to.\" Song Lin was a smart cookie, she knew better than to play hardball. </p><p>Huo Mian felt a little guilty and embarrassed after hearing what Song Lin said. </p><p>\"I will try my best to help out.\" Huo Mian buttoned up her uniform and walked over to room 1 with the medicine. </p><p>The bodyguards were thrilled when they saw Huo Mian, because they noticed that she was the only nurse capable of handling their boss. </p><p>Su Yu was reading the newspaper when Huo Mian walked in; he looked rather serious.</p><p>\"Get the hell out,\" Su Yu said without glancing at the door, he thought the woman at the door was one of those social climbers. </p><p>Huo Mian walked over without a sound, turned open the medicine bottle, held out a couple of pills and said, \"Fractures take about a hundred days to heal. It's not that big of a deal since you only tore your ACL, but it's not something that should be overlooked. You need to take the medicine and get reassessed.\" </p><p>Su Yu looked up upon hearing Huo Mian's voice, his eyes glimmered with the slightest amount of happiness. </p><p>\"Should you really be worrying about me?

Didn't this news shake up the entire city? How are you taking care of it?\" </p><p>\"How I take care of it is my business, you don't need to worry about it. Hurry up and take your medicine; I need to go play chess with the grandpa next door. Stop wasting time, everyone's very busy.\" </p><p>Huo Mian nagged impatiently, causing Su Yu to not know whether he should cry or laugh... </p><p>He wanted to ask if the grandpa next door was really so charming that she would rather go play Chinese Chess with him than take care of a rich young man? </p><p>\"Is it Chinese Chess? I know how to play too, wanna play?\" </p><p>\"No,\" Huo Mian rejected him directly. </p><p>\"Why not?\" Su Yu asked. </p><p>\"Because staring at your face for a long period of time gives me depression.\" Huo Mian turned on her heels and left. </p><p>\"You….?\" Before Su Yu could say anything, Huo Mian interjected, \"Take your medicine.\" </p><p>She then shut the door with a loud bang.

I'm not an outsider; I'm dad's son, unlike you, you bastard child.\" </p><p>Huo Mian glanced at him coldly and replied, \"As if you're not the child of a homewrecker as well.\" </p><p>\"What did you say?\" Huo Siyi was the same as Huo Yanyan - uncalm, extremely arrogant, spoiled, and used to getting his way.</p><p>Upon hearing what Huo Mian said, he immediately burst out in anger. </p><p>Luckily, Huo Zhenghai raised his head and stopped their banter. \"Siyi, go outside.\" </p><p>\"Dad…?\" Huo Siyi was clearly unwilling. </p><p>\"It's fine, I also have some things I need to talk to her about.\" Huo Zhenghai's expression was serious. </p><p>Huo Siyi glared at Huo Mian, and then he left the room unwillingly. </p><p>Huo Zhenghai glanced at Huo Mian and asked, \"Did you come to find me because you think that I exposed you?\" </p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"No, I know that it was Huo Yanyan and you had nothing to do with it. I just have some things to say.\" </p><p>\"Your mother was here this morning as well, it was clear that she was upset because she thought that it was my fault and that I wanted to force you to come back. She spent the morning yelling at me. Her temper hasn't gotten any better, it seems,\" Huo Zhenghai recounted the morning's events with a calm demeanor that suited his current age and status. After all, he was a businessman that had been through all sorts of hardship.</p><p>\"I was not aware of that, she didn't call me. I'm just here to express my personal opinions today.\" </p><p>\"What do you want to say?\" </p><p>\"I want to say… rather than hoping that I will help them, you should teach them to protect themselves. From what I see, with Huo Yanyan and Huo Siyi's IQ, it won't be long before they die in Huo Siqian's hands. If it weren't for you, they would have been kicked out a time ago. Looking at the surface, what Huo Yanyan did doesn't benefit me, because everyone thinks that Mom only gave birth to me in an attempt to climb into the Huo family. But, that doesn't affect me negatively. In fact, I could take this opportunity to return to the family, but I wouldn't be the most trustworthy ally since they've already resorted to treating me that way. Do you really think I would still be stupid enough to help them? Furthermore, if anyone were to dig deeper into this matter, they will find out that Huo Yanyan's mother was the third person in your marriage with your first Mrs. Huo, which will only harm their reputation. Only Huo Yanyan could do such a self-harming act. In fact, I'm pretty concerned for her IQ, so I'm telling you that you should discipline her more, or else the end result won't be pretty.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's words were like blades cutting through Huo Zhenghai's heart.</p><p>The pros and cons of the situation were clearly laid out, and since Huo Mian was a commoner to begin with, she would be the same no matter how many insults and abuse she endured. </p><p>But Huo Yanyan was different.

Relax, you wouldn't be doing this for anything. I can invite the lawyers to prove that the company shares I'm giving you are really yours, as long as you promise to stand by Yanyan and Siyi.

To me, I would rather have you promise to make up for the 20 years of paternal love that I missed out on than the billions of yuan of inheritance money that you're offering.\" </p><p>Huo Zhenghai was feeling a little guilty. Paternal love? He didn't have any, he only ever favored Huo Yanyan and Huo Siyi. </p><p>For some reason, he just didn't like Huo Mian, no matter how intelligent and shrewd he knew she was. </p><p>\"Don't be conflicted, I'm just joking. Uncle Jing was great; he was actually like a father to me, so I'm not missing out on any paternal love.

Smiling wickedly, she replied, \"Of course, I even went to the hospital to find him today, and he kept yelling about giving me some shares of inheritance. I was thinking, what am I supposed to do with all that money, it's not like I'd ever finish spending it.\" </p><p>\"Why didn't you tell me these things?\" Ning Zhiyuan's tone became a bit reproachful. </p><p>\"You never asked me.\" Huo Mian found the situation rather funny.</p><p>\"I really think we missed out on so much, my relationship with Wu Xiaoxue isn't what you think. I don't love her,\" Ning Zhiyuan suddenly said. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded. \"Yeah, you just want to have a baby with her, that's not love.\" </p><p>Such blatant mockery left Ning Zhiyuan immediately speechless… </p><p>He said, \"Mian, do you still blame me for everything?\" </p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to say something, she heard the key turning in the door, and she immediately hung up. </p><p>As expected, Qin Chu had come home… </p><p>\"What are you doing? You're acting suspiciously.\" Qin Chu could tell that Huo Mian was nervous. </p><p>\"Um… Nothing.\" Huo Mian felt a bit guilty. </p><p>\"I thought I heard you on the phone? Were you talking to that miserable looking ophthalmologist?\" </p><p>\"Are you Sherlock Holmes?\" Huo Mian was exasperated that he could guess that.</p><p>\"So you did a terrible thing, are you going to apologize or what?\" Qin Chu removed his jacket, straightened his tie, and asked seriously. </p><p>Huo Mian immediately lowered her head… calculating her next move. </p><p>\"What do you want to eat tonight? I'll go make it right now.\" In order to impress him, Huo Mian changed the focus to the dinner menu. </p><p>\"Steamed Huo Mian.\" </p><p>Qin Chu sat down next to Huo Mian on the sofa, speaking casually. </p><p>\"Qin… Chu?

Huo Mian had guessed correctly. Once a nosy person dug deeper into the situation, the fact that Shen Jiani was a third wheel to Huo Zhenghai and Jiang Hong's marriage and how she proudly moved into the Huo family with her children was also exposed. This caused quite a large disturbance, but Shen Jiani was more cunning. Before the public rage could push to a climax, she took Huo Yanyan onto talk shows to cry about how she had been wronged, how she and Huo Zhenghai were in love, and how she had moved into the Huo Family with the matriarch's silent permission, unlike how the rumors painted her as a scheming b*tch. </p><p>Seeing how the public opinion was reversed, Shen Jiani couldn't hold it in any longer and jumped out at the first opportunity to cleanse her own name. </p><p>This did fit their style… </p><p>That night, Huo Mian called her mother, and they had a long discussion. </p><p>The next day, when reporters went to interview Yang Meirong, although she really wanted to insult the scheming b*tch Shen Jiani, she followed Mian's advice. </p><p>Mian had reminded her multiple times to not do that, as sometimes silence was the best response, or things would only get worse. </p><p>- South Side Recuperation Center - </p><p>Su Yu was pretty free lately. Without his luxurious nightlife, he was able to spend his nights following the latest gossip. </p><p>He had been consistently following Huo Mian's situation, and today's reversal seemed to be within his predictions. </p><p>But Huo Mian's lack of response and action only increased his curiosity. </p><p>\"The power that stands behind her didn't seem to do anything this time around,\" Su Yu exclaimed. </p><p>After the situation with that pregnant patient last time, Su Yu felt that there was a mysterious force behind Huo Mian. </p><p>At that, he lifted his phone, found Huo Siqian on his Wechat list, and sent him a message. </p><p>\"That sister of yours is very interesting, there's finally a presentable woman in the Huo family.\" </p><p>\"Are you talking about Huo Yanyan?\" Huo Siqian responded instantly. </p><p>\"Huo Mian,\" Su Yue replied with two words. </p><p>Huo Siqian didn't reply, but a voice call came right over. </p><p>\"How's your health? You seem to be free, seeing as you have the time browse WeChat,\" Huo Siqian joked.</p><p>He was in the same circle as Su Yu, and they would get together with everyone all the time. They weren't necessarily close, but they weren't strangers either. </p><p>\"It's great, I really like it here.\" Su Yu's mouth tugged into a smile. </p><p>\"You know… Huo Mian?\" Huo Siqian asked. </p><p>\"Yeah, she's my personal nurse,\" Su Yu said on purpose. </p><p>Huo Siqian smiled, \"Really? What a coincidence.\" </p><p>\"That sister of yours is really great, so if I said that I wanted to date her, would you support me?\"</p><p>On the other end of the line, Huo Siqian's expression changed slightly, and the light in his eyes became sharp.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":235,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:43.723","Link":"Chapter-235","NameDisplay":"Chapter 235"},{"ID":181120949442422941,"Name":"Chapter 236: Face Slap","NameUnsign":"Chapter 236: Face Slap","Description":"<p>Chapter 236: Face Slap</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Ah, your taste has worsened significantly lately, that sister of mine isn't even good looking.

Okay, not linking her WeChat ID to her phone number was a twisted idea that did fit Huo Mian's style.</p><p>He picked up his phone and dialed a number, \"I don't care what you do, get me Huo Mian's WeChat number in 3 minutes.\"</p><p>As expected, three minutes later, he received a message on his phone.</p><p>On it was a series of numbers, which Su Yu searched on WeChat and found that it was indeed Huo Mian, whose profile picture was a photo from when she was young.</p><p>It seemed to be from many years ago, as she wore a white t-shirt and had a high ponytail.</p><p>\"Such a dumb look.\" Su Yu smiled, and then he added her as a friend.</p><p>After a long time, he still wasn't accepted, so he began to feel agitated. He added her again, writing, Su Yu.</p><p>He was directly rejected this time. Huo Mian replied, \"I don't know you well.\"</p><p>Su Yu was so angry and speechless. This was the first time he had sent a woman a friend request, and it must be noted that most women see having him as a friend on Wechat as an honor that could be bragged about.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, just you wait,\" he threatened.</p><p>On the other end, Huo Mian was about to sleep when she glanced at the message, and she mumbled to herself, \"He crazy.\"</p><p>- The next morning -</p><p>When Huo Mian woke up, things took another turn; apparently Huo Siqian's adoptive mother had agreed to an interview.</p><p>Her words in the interview were a slap on Shen Jiani's face. She claimed that she did not agree for Shen Jiani to move into the Huo Family, nor did she admit to a bad relationship between her and Huo Zhenghai. She even directly criticized that some people would do anything to climb up.</p><p>Shen Jiani didn't think that Jiang Hong would stand in direct opposition to her, and she ran to cry to Huo Zhenghai about it in the hospital.</p><p>Although Huo Zhenghai sympathized with his mistress, he was too scared of the Jiang Family's power to blame Jiang Hong.</p><p>He could only convince Shen Jiani not to escalate the situation any further and make peace instead.</p><p>Neither Huo Mian nor her mother made a statement during all this, so not long after, the attention around them died down.</p><p>A few nurses at the hospital tried to gain information about Huo Siqian's private life through her, but she acted as if she didn't know anything.</p><p>When taking care of the old grandpa in room 2, she would also give Su Yu his medicine, very unwillingly.</p><p>She didn't want to tend to that prissy-pants prince.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, why won't you add my WeChat?\" Su Yu took one look at Huo Mian as she walked in, threw off his covers, and jumped up to ask.</p><p>\"What law in China states that I have to add your WeChat?\"</p><p>Huo Mian didn't bother raising her head. She headed directly to place the medicine on the tray, and poured him a glass of warm water.</p><p>\"Take your medicine.\"</p><p>\"Add me, and I'll take it.\" Mr. Su's temper started flaring up again. </p><p>\"I don't actually care, it's not like you're taking medicine for my sake.\" </p><p>Clearly, this method wasn't working, and Su Yu was so angry that his teeth started aching… </p><p>\"Huo Mian, last night I called Huo Siqian, and we talked about your situation.\" </p><p>As expected, the moment Huo Mian heard Huo Siqian's name, she paused in her steps. </p><p>Seeing that he had her attention, Su Yu pretended that there was something profound going on and stated, \"Huo Siqian… seems to treat you differently than a little sister.\"</p><p>After hearing that, Huo Mian's facial expression changed...</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":236,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:44.243","Link":"Chapter-236","NameDisplay":"Chapter 236"},{"ID":18112094944791608,"Name":"Chapter 237: A Statement","NameUnsign":"Chapter 237: A Statement","Description":"<p>Chapter 237: A Statement</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>In the end, Huo Mian turned around, glared at Su Yu and dropped an arrogant response.</p><p>\"Looks like I've been too kind when doing you injections lately…\"</p><p>\"…\"</p><p>Was this brat blatantly threatening him?</p><p>Huo Yanyan and Shen Jiani were enough to make her head hurt, so now that Su Yu brought up Huo Siqian, it completely stressed her out.</p><p>Zhu Lingling once asked her on WeChat how she planned to deal with all this.</p><p>She told her that she wanted to ignore it, which meant that she was not going to respond to anyone and just let the matter resolve itself.</p><p>But looking at the current situation, it appeared that if Shen Jiani and her people didn't stir up any results, they wouldn't give up.</p><p>Huo Mian was in the middle of cooking up a revenge plan to protect herself while slapping them on the face.</p><p>Just as she was contemplating what to do, an online statement induced a frenzy…</p><p>\"Hello everyone, recently because of certain things, society and I alike have been troubled. Thus, I have especially stepped up to explain some things to everyone and clear my name.

I have no monetary connections or debt to the Huo Family, nor will I participate in their fight for inheritance. Please stop making your own assumptions, as it could negatively affect my family and I. From now on, I want to go on with my normal life and not talk about this matter any further. I would like to make it known that I will not return to the Huo family, nor will I accept anything from them that would benefit me. I won't take a single share of their inheritance, or go to their company to work. Please let me return to my normal life, thank you.\" At the end of the statement was her name, 'Huo Mian'.</p><p>The entire statement was written in Huo Mian's tone and sounded very real. Although there wasn't a signature from Huo Mian, no one would doubt it. After all, forging one's signature was punishable by law.</p><p>Seeing that the statement fit her own thoughts so perfectly, Huo Mian's mood was lifted.</p><p>Other than Qin Chu, she couldn't think of anyone else who would be able to guess what she was thinking and upload a statement like that at a crucial time like this.</p><p>She immediately dialed a number on her phone... </p><p>The call was picked up after 3 seconds. </p><p>\"Hello?\" Qin Chu picked up the phone. </p><p>\"I saw the statement. It was written beautifully, but it was just missing one sentence.\" </p><p>\"What sentence?\" </p><p>\"You should've written that I want to cut all ties with the Huos, and never talk to them again until I die.\" </p><p>\"If I wrote that, it would make you seem narrow-minded and people will say bad things about you, which will hurt your public image.\"</p><p>\"I'm joking, I know you've thought about it all. I'm assuming… you wrote that statement yourself, and not your company's PR team, right? You carefully thought out each word for me, didn't you?\" Huo Mian softly asked.</p><p>\"Guess your eyes didn't get worse.\" Big Boss Qin was acting all prideful like a lion again.</p><p>That statement was the product of his lunch break. He had diligently typed it out on his laptop. Then, after confirming that there were no mistakes, he uploaded it to the internet.</p><p>Because of Qin Chu's involvement, this statement was quickly disseminated amongst all the major media outlets and was immediately seen by everyone.</p><p>\"Qin Chu…?\"</p><p>\"Yeah?\"</p><p>\"I actually really want to thank you, but I won't say it this time, because you once said that I shouldn't always say thank you.

I'm already by your side, and I'll never leave.\"</p><p>Huo Mian held her phone, her eyes glistening with unshed tears…</p><p>\"Let's have dinner tonight, my treat.\" After finishing her sentence, Huo Mian hung up the phone.</p><p>The corner of Qin Chu's lips lifted up slightly, he knew that his baby was feeling touched again.</p><p>It was only a statement, but it conveyed everything Huo Mian wanted to say. Furthermore, it all seemed much different because it was Qin Chu who had written it personally.</p><p>That night, Huo Mian rushed home.</p><p>She changed into a dark blue dress shirt and black slacks, giving off the impression of a white-collar employee.</p><p>As she was getting ready to leave, she got a call from Huo Siqian.</p><p>He seemed to be calling her quite frequently lately…</p><p>Huo Mian thought that he was going to admonish her about the statement.</p><p>Surprisingly he said, \"You better quit that job at South Side.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Huo Mian didn't understand.</p><p>\"If you don't want to cause trouble, then don't interact with Su Yu.

He turned around and drove out of the area. \"What do you want to eat?\" </p><p>\"My treat today, pick your favorite, of course,\" smiled Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Japanese okay?\" </p><p>\"Of course!\" Huo Mian wasn't picky; she would eat anything and everything if she went out with others. </p><p>So, when Qin Chu picked Japanese, she immediately nodded. </p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the car parked outside a Japanese restaurant that looked high-end from its decor. </p><p>The two entered into a graceful little private room, where the tatami decorations were placed with care. </p><p>A popular Japanese song played in the background. Even though they couldn't understand the lyrics, the melody was still very nice.</p><p>During the meal, Huo Mian and Qin Chu casually chatted... </p><p>\"Qin Chu…\" </p><p>\"You call me 'honey' when you need me, and 'Qin Chu' when you don't. Huo Mian, can you be less obvious when burning bridges?\" </p><p>\"…\" </p><p>Huo Mian felt terrible when Qin Chu said this, and then she lightly coughed, \"Uhm… Honey, I've been causing trouble for you since we got married. Will you ignore me if you ever get annoyed at me one day.\" </p><p>\"Do you think I would do that?\" </p><p>Huo Mian shook her head. \"I know you won't, but I hate myself sometimes, always causing trouble.\" </p><p>\"What's wrong with that? I don't mind cleaning up after you.\" Qin Chu held up the sake glass and took a small sip. </p><p>With the concentrated alcohol aroma on the corners of her mouth, Huo Mian would occasionally think, did she save the entire galaxy in her previous life? Why did she meet such a warm, kind, rich, tall, and handsome man like Qin Chu?</p><p>After the statement was published, Qin Chu utilized some connections and ways to publish several news pieces in the afternoon and evening. All of those basically fought for Huo Mian's innocence, and no matter how Shen Jiani pretended and faked her grief, she could never change the fact that she was a homewrecker. Huo Yanyan's reputation completely went down the drain as well, and she was so pissed that she didn't go out for several days, in fear that others would talk behind her back. </p><p>Huo Zhenghai was also discharged from the hospital since Huo Mian had already stated that there was no point for him to continue to pretend to be sick. </p><p>\"Do you know when I wanted to return to the Huo family the most?\" asked Huo Mian carelessly, as she was on her phone, and accidentally saw the news of Huo Zhenghai's discharge from the hospital. </p><p>\"You have times when you want to go back to the Huo family?\" Qin Chu was somewhat curious. </p><p>Huo Mian nodded. </p><p>Then she continued to say, \"It was seven years ago when we were in love. Back then your mom didn't like my family background. But the truth was, I despised myself as well. I would always dream of Huo Zhenghai suddenly wanting me back, and then I would become a socialite like Huo Yanyan. Maybe then, your mom would have agreed to us being together.\" </p><p>Huo Mian held the teacup with both of her hands as she spoke; she looked like a little girl… </p><p>She was cute, but the look also made him feel sorry... </p><p>\"Are you surprised that I was once vain?\" Huo Mian teasingly stuck out her tongue.</p><p>Qin Chu looked at her as his heart throbbed. \"Mian…stop.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":238,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:45.303","Link":"Chapter-238","NameDisplay":"Chapter 238"},{"ID":181120949458463989,"Name":"Chapter 239: Intervention","NameUnsign":"Chapter 239: Intervention","Description":"<p>Chapter 239: Intervention</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You know that I never treated you differently because of your family situation.\" </p><p>\"But your mom despises me, or why else would Uncle Jing die? If Uncle Jing didn't save me back then, then… I would have been the one to die, and I wouldn't be sitting here today.\" </p><p>\"Mian…\" It was brutal for Qin Chu to recollect this painful memory. </p><p>He already tried his best to make amends, but he knew that was an unerasable nightmare for Huo Mian. </p><p>She had been carrying around such a heavy mental baggage for all these years… </p><p>However, what could he do? The person who orchestrated this was his mother. Could he kill her? It was impossible. </p><p>\"Qin Chu, I didn't bring this up on purpose. I just wanted to let you know that at one time, I hated myself for what I was, and I hated Huo Zhenghai for not giving me a reasonable identity back then. Now that I'm older, I won't ever give him the chance to take advantage of me.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" </p><p>\"I know that you're the only one who understands me, or else, you wouldn't release an announcement that completely aligns with what I was feeling. Sometimes, I don't think that I'm so miserable anymore, because at least there's someone who understands me in this world. He knows what I'm thinking about, he is willing to listen to all the pain I'm going through, he wants to be by my side, and he helps me heal the wounds in my heart.\" </p><p>Huo Mian was usually either distracted or would avoid the sentimental topics that Qin Chu tried to bring up. </p><p>However, now that she brought this up herself, Qin Chu didn't know what to do.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, if I lose everything one day and only have you left, will you still be by my side?\" </p><p>\"Of course.\" </p><p>\"Me too, if you lose everything one day, or are no longer the President of GK, or Dr. Qin the miraculous neurosurgeon, or the dreamy Qin that's completely invincible, I'm still willing to be with you. If the whole world betrays you, then I will betray the entire world with you, without hesitation.\" </p><p>\"So… Miss Huo Mian, are you confessing your love for me?\" After all this time listening to her, Qin Chu thought that this girl seemed to be confessing her love today. </p><p>\"Love my a*s! Eat, I'm starving.\" Huo Mian changed the subject again at the most sentimental part. </p><p>To prevent Qin Chu's enteritis from happening again, she especially told him to eat more wasabi for antibacterial purposes.</p><p>The two ate dinner happily, and while they ate, her brother sent a WeChat message saying that he had read the statement, and that he and mother were both very happy. </p><p>This problem seemed to be taken care of, as no matter how much trouble Shen Jiani and Huo Yanyan tried to stir up, no one seemed to care.</p><p>Even though everyone knew that Huo Mian was the illegitimate daughter of the Huo Family, Huo Mian didn't think it was a scandalous thing. </p><p>This all happened over twenty years ago, so if anyone dug it out, it would only be done to cause a short-term sensation.</p><p>After this passed, who cared about whose daughter she was? Plus, the statement had already declared that she would never return to the Huo family and would have nothing to do with the Huo family, so naturally, no one would approach her anymore to get anything from her. </p><p>It was also safe to say that those little nurses at the recuperation center would no longer chase her around for Huo Siqian's number… </p><p>After dinner, the two held hands as they walked out of the restaurant. The wind was heavy at night, so Qin Chu took off his jacket and put it on Huo Mian. He held her hand as they got into the car. </p><p>Qin Chu's car was the only Maybach with imperial-tier configuration in the city, and the license plate was also extremely identifiable. </p><p>As they waited for the lights at an intersection, Mrs. Qin slightly frowned inside a black Bentley. </p><p>\"Song, look at that, is that my son's car?\" </p><p>\"Seems like it.\" The driver looked at the license plate to make sure.</p><p>\"Why is there a woman in his car? Follow him, let's take a look.\" Mrs. Qin was suddenly interested; she thought she saw a woman with long hair sitting in the passenger's seat.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":239,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:45.847","Link":"Chapter-239","NameDisplay":"Chapter 239"},{"ID":181120949463858067,"Name":"Chapter 240: Spy","NameUnsign":"Chapter 240: Spy","Description":"<p>Chapter 240: Spy</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>The chauffeur, Song, heard Mrs. Qin and immediately went after the Maybach. </p><p>Qin Chu carelessly looked in the rear-view mirror and noticed that something was wrong. </p><p>They originally planned to head home, but he immediately took a sharp turn towards another direction. </p><p>\"Hey, that's not the way home,\" Huo Mian immediately reminded him. </p><p>\"We're not going home. Let's go for a ride, since we hardly get the chance to.\" </p><p>Huo Mian was speechless… </p><p>Was it a good idea to drive around on a cold night? However, she believed in Qin Chu's decisions in doing things. </p><p>Huo Mian asked no more, but she suddenly realized something as she watched Qin Chu take odd turns around small and big streets. </p><p>She looked in the rear-view mirror. \"So we've been followed.\" </p><p>\"That's my mom's car,\" Qin Chu said. </p><p>\"Oh.\" Qin Chu's mother treated Huo Mian like a mortal enemy, and it was the same the other way around.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't even want to hear another word about her... </p><p>After ten or so minutes of turning around in circles, they finally lost the black Bentley. After Qin Chu drove around Rainbow Square one last time, they returned to Imperial Park. </p><p>\"Song, what is happening?\" Mrs. Qin felt anxious, because she wanted to see the woman her son was spending time with, but they had lost the car. </p><p>\"Sorry, Mrs. Qin. Young Master drove too fast. Plus, he took small roads and one-way streets. We lost him.\" </p><p>\"Fine, then let's head back now.\" </p><p>- Back at the Qin family Manor -</p><p>Mrs. Qin immediately took out her phone and called a number. </p><p>Jiang Lingyue had a facial mask on, and when she saw the caller ID, she immediately picked up and answered politely, \"Mrs. Qin.\" </p><p>\"Were you just in Chu's car?\" asked Mrs. Qin. </p><p>\"No, I wasn't,\" Jiang Lingyue replied honestly. </p><p>\"Oh, I just saw a woman in Chu's passenger seat, and I thought it was you,\" Mrs. Qin knew that Jiang Lingyue had very long hair, but the woman in the car only had her hair up to her shoulders, so they were completely different people. She only asked this to see whether Jiang Lingyue would lie, but luckily she was quite honest. </p><p>\"Oh, it might be the client that came from Taipei today. She's the manager of a collaboration project, and President Qin was busy the entire day, so Assistant Yang might have set the meeting at night.\" </p><p>Jiang Lingyue reacted fast and immediately made up a person… </p><p>Even though she also wanted to know who the woman inside Qin Chu's car was.</p><p>\"Oh, so that's who it was? I think I must have been overthinking things, how are things with you with Chu lately?\" </p><p>\"President Qin treats me very well, but the company is really busy so we don't have much private time together.\" </p><p>\"Busy is good, but you should still think about yourself. As a girl, you should also be a bit more assertive. Chu isn't that aloof and you're so pretty, he'll fall for you sooner or later,\" advised Mrs. Qin. </p><p>\"I know, thanks for being so kind, Mrs. Qin.\" </p><p>After the call ended, Jiang Lingyue thought for a moment, and then she dialed Qin Chu's number. </p><p>Qin Chu and Huo Mian had just arrived home; when he saw the caller ID, he noticed that it was an unknown number. </p><p>\"Hello?\" </p><p>\"Hi, President Qin, I'm Jiang Lingyue.\" </p><p>\"What is it?\" CEO Qin spoke formally as he took off his jacket. </p><p>\"Mrs. Qin just called me to say that she saw a woman in your car, and I told her that it was a client from Taipei.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" Before Jiang Lingyue could finish, Qin Chu hung up. </p><p>Jiang Lingyue bit her lips; she was unhappy that she had been rejected, again and again… </p><p>Just as Qin Chu prepared to sit down and watch the financial news, he heard a scream from upstairs. </p><p>\"Aah!!\"</p><p>Qin Chu immediately ran up the stairs when he heard Huo Mian's scream...</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":240,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:46.387","Link":"Chapter-240","NameDisplay":"Chapter 240"},{"ID":181120949469043782,"Name":"Chapter 241: Awkward","NameUnsign":"Chapter 241: Awkward","Description":"<p>Chapter 241: Awkward</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Mian, what's wrong?\" Qin Chu hurriedly knocked on the door of the washroom.</p><p>\"I…I….\" Huo Mian was too embarrassed to talk.</p><p>\"What happened?\" Qin Chu was worried to death.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, my period came early.\" Huo Mian wanted to cry, but she couldn't let it out.</p><p>Her period had always been perfectly on time, and she thought it wouldn't begin for another four days.</p><p>However, it decided to suddenly come today, which left her not knowing what to do…</p><p>\"So… what should I do?\" Qin Chu also didn't know what to do.</p><p>A woman's menstrual cycle didn't seem to be something men could help with.</p><p>\"I don't think… there is any of it left at home, so could you buy some for me?\" Huo Mian couldn't come out of the washroom because her pants were stained, so she had to hide inside.</p><p>\"Okay,\" Qin Chu awkwardly said that one word, and then he headed downstairs.</p><p>Five minutes later, Huo Mian's phone rang…</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Which brand do you want?\" Qin Chu asked in all seriousness.</p><p>\"Uhm… any kind,\"</p><p>\"Length?\"</p><p>\"Uhm… longer than 38 centimeters?\"</p><p>\"For daytime or night time use?\"</p><p>\"Ahem… a pack of each would be fine,\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Qin Chu hung up.</p><p>Huo Mian was tormented by this awkward conversation between her and Qin Chu.</p><p>Men didn't seem to understand anything at all, but she couldn't blame Qin Chu, as this was the first time he went out to buy stuff like that.</p><p>\"Not only were there plenty of brands, but there were also different lengths, different ones for night or day, and even different materials such as mesh, cotton, or silk...</p><p>It was too complicated, and too much information.</p><p>Five minutes later, Qin Chu returned.</p><p>From the washroom door, Huo Mian was shocked when he handed the bags of pads to her.</p><p>There were more than twenty packages...</p><p>\"Why did you buy so much?\" Huo Mian was speechless.</p><p>\"You can save it to use for later.\"</p><p>\"Okay… you really know how to prepare for a rainy day.\"</p><p>Ten minutes later, Huo Mian finally slowly walked out from inside.</p><p>Qin Chu pointed to a bowl on the coffee table. \"Drink that.\"</p><p>'What's that?\" Huo Mian froze.</p><p>\"Poison.\"</p><p>\"…..\"</p><p>\"It's brown sugar water, right?\" Huo Mian guessed what it was from the deep red color.</p><p>\"Then why did you still ask if you knew?\"</p><p>\"You know to make me brown sugar water?

After all, it was prepared by her man.</p><p>That night in bed, Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu, and hesitantly said, \"I'm on my period today, can you sleep on your own bed? It's not so convenient for us tonight.\"</p><p>\"You say it as if I get to do things to you when you're not on your period.\"</p><p>\"…\"</p><p>\"Go to sleep, don't worry about it.\" Before Huo Mian could say anything, Qin Chu directly let himself onto her bed.</p><p>Huo Mian laid down unsettlingly…</p><p>During her last few periods, she just happened to be working night shifts, so she managed to avoid him.</p><p>However, this was the first time she slept with Qin Chu on her period, which felt somewhat strange.</p><p>Huo Mian laid flat and felt sore around her waist; she would always get cramps on her first day.</p><p>Plus, she also bled a lot on her first day, so she never slept well, because she didn't dare to move around so much.</p><p>Suddenly, a hot hand pressed onto her stomach…</p><p>It scared her…</p><p>\"You…\"</p><p>\"They say that this could lessen the pain,\" Qin Chu softly rubbed her stomach after he spoke.</p><p>Huo Mian now didn't know how to respond, \"Did you search for this online as well?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Honey, could we discuss something for later?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"Could we not search for these random things anymore on the internet? I'm only on my period, I'm not pregnant, I don't want to be so needy.\"</p><p>The truth was, she didn't mind Qin Chu searching these stuff up, but her stomach was too sensitive, and she couldn't stand him pressing his hand there.</p><p>She felt completely overwhelmed…</p><p>Qin Chu sighed slightly. \"The internet is right.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Huo Mian turned around to look at Qin Chu curiously.</p><p>\"Don't try to reason with a biological creature that bleeds seven days a month, because women are the most insane existence in the universe.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was shocked once again…</p><p>She should truly consider cutting off the home internet now.

It's definitely much better here than at home.\"</p><p>\"Yes, but you guys don't seem to have any rooms left over at the neurosurgery department.\" Embarrassed, Wei Dong scratched his head.</p><p>Ever since he failed to lend Huo Mian money last time, he thought of himself as less of a man. He felt humiliated that he couldn't deliver what he promised.</p><p>So, he didn't even speak much anymore in the WeChat group, and after Huo Mian and Qin Chu left the group, he felt much better.</p><p>However, Zhu Lingling knew of all of this, and she would occasionally make fun of him.</p><p>He never expected to see Huo Mian here; he only saw her on the news a while back.</p><p>However, he knew that with Qin Chu around, nothing would happen to Huo Mian.</p><p>That was the truth; thanks to Qin Chu, Huo Mian was able to dodge every bullet that came her way.</p><p>\"Oh, I see. Wait here for a second, I'll go ask.\" After Huo Mian spoke, she went back to the on-call booth to call the head nurse.</p><p>The head nurse said that there were rooms in the neurosurgery department, but it was based on the patient's identity and status.</p><p>Normally, the hospital would use \"no vacancy\" as an excuse to get rid of those without any power or background.</p><p>\"Head Nurse, could you help me out? This is my classmate's dad, and he is suffering from cerebral thrombosis. He wants to stay here for recovery, and it's pretty hard on the old man.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll call the Neurosurgery Department for you.\"</p><p>Luckily, the head nurse was a nice person, and shortly afterward, she called Huo Mian back and told her that she got a room for her.</p><p>\"Wei Dong, I helped you reserve room 9. You can take your father over there right away.\"</p><p>\"Really? Thanks, Huo Mian.\"</p><p>\"Not at all, go. His condition is dire, so call me anytime if you need anything. I'll be here in the Orthopedics Department.</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>Wei Dong was filled with gratitude because Huo Mian had helped his father find a room, but, at the same time, he felt even more embarrassed to face her.</p><p>At noon, before Huo Mian could head over to the cafeteria for lunch, she was still reading patients' charts when Wei Dong walked over with food.</p><p>\"I bought you lunch.\"</p><p>\"You didn't have to do this.\" Huo Mian raised her head and smiled.</p><p>\"Yes, I do. Plus, it's not anything expensive. I remember that back in high school, you used to like dim sum, so I bought you some when I was out getting lunch for dad.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\" Huo Mian smiled and took the bento box.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I'm truly sorry about what happened before.\"</p><p>\"Before… oh, it's fine, it's all in the past. You don't need to apologize, it's nothing.\"</p><p>The truth was, Huo Mian never hated Wei Dong. She even felt thankful and lucky that Wei Dong didn't lend her the money.</p><p>If it weren't for him, she would never have ended up with Qin Chu… In the end, Wei Dong helped her reunite with Qin Chu.</p><p>\"But my feelings for you are real, and all I can say is that… I'm not lucky enough to marry my goddess.\" Wei Dong felt slightly regretful.</p><p>If his opponent wasn't Qin Chu, or if Qin Chu wasn't so powerful, he wouldn't have let her go without a fight.</p><p>\"Goddess? Don't put me on a pedestal, I'm just a little nurse.\"</p><p>Just then, Wei Dong's phone rang; after saying goodbye to Huo Mian, he walked out while on the phone.</p><p>Huo Mian opened the bento box and ate the dim sum with great appetite…</p><p>\"You're not that pretty, but you sure have a way with men.\" Coincidentally, Su Yu saw what just happened.</p><p>Even though he couldn't hear what they said, he saw that man give food to Huo Mian and Huo Mian smiling back at him.</p><p>The truth was, he felt slight hints of jealousy...</p><p>Huo Mian raised her head and looked at Su Yu; she spoke impolitely, \"You're from the stud farm yourself, so do you really have the right to judge others without any shame?\"</p><p>\"You little brat, what did you just call me?\" Su Yu was pissed.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":242,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:47.4","Link":"Chapter-242","NameDisplay":"Chapter 242"},{"ID":181120949479186399,"Name":"Chapter 243: Constraint","NameUnsign":"Chapter 243: Constraint","Description":"<p>Chapter 243: Constraint</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You know who I am talking about.\"</p><p>\"Don't be silly, I haven't slept with a lot of those women,\" Su Yu knew that Huo Mian saw plenty of different women enter and exit his room, so it was natural for her to assume.</p><p>\"How many is 'a lot'?\" Huo Mian looked at Su Yu as she thought it was funny.</p><p>\"Why should I tell you?

I'd rather kill myself than be your woman.\"</p><p>\"You…\" Su Yu rarely won whenever he fought with Huo Mian, but even when he lost, he would never get mad.</p><p>\"Who was that man? Your boyfriend? He's not that good looking, he must be one of those vulgar nouveau riches,\" Su Yu mockingly laughed.</p><p>\"If having money makes someone a vulgar nouveau riche, then you're a super vulgar nouveau riche.\"</p><p>\"What? You don't like it when I talk about your boyfriend like that?\"</p><p>\"He's not my boyfriend,\" Huo Mian replied as she lowered her head to look at the charts.</p><p>Su Yu seemed to be happier when she said that person wasn't her boyfriend. He put his hands on the on-call booth and looked at Huo Mian, \"So, do you have a boyfriend?\"</p><p>\"Why does it matter to you?\"</p><p>\"If you don't have a boyfriend, I could introduce someone to you. Look at those bodyguards of mine, they're all handsome and tall, and all better than that kid who was just there.\"</p><p>\"Your bodyguards sure are better than you.\" Huo Mian said as she raised her head to look at Su Yu.</p><p>\"So? Do you want me to introduce one of them to you?\" Su Yu smiled mysteriously.</p><p>\"Doesn't the Su family work in the banking sector? When did you guys switch to matchmaking? Is your business transforming?\"</p><p>Su Yu's face immediately turned grim…</p><p>\"Hey, you despicable girl, I meant well…\"</p><p>\"I don't need your good intentions, you might as well tightly shut the doors to your room, and don't let your rumors fill every corner of the hospital. Ever since you've arrived, the hospital's reputation has gone down. Those who are familiar with us will think that we're a recovery center, while those who aren't might suspect that we're a brothel.\"</p><p>After Huo Mian spoke, she rolled her eyes at Su Yu and returned to the on-call office with her dim sum.</p><p>She left a disgruntled Su Yu alone at the on-call booth...</p><p>After she finished a delicious lunch, she looked at the time; she had twenty more minutes before her lunch break was over.</p><p>Huo Mian logged onto WeChat and chitchatted with Zhu Lingling. She eventually mentioned to her about seeing Wei Dong.</p><p>Zhu Lingling was biased towards Wei Dong, so she immediately warned, \"Ignore Wei Dong, he's a despicable opportunist. Thankfully he knew to back down in the face of adversity, or else Qin Chu would have definitely punished him for it.\"</p><p>Huo Mian laughed...</p><p>\"Right, so have you two… done the Bow-chick-a-wow-wow yet?\" Zhu Lingling gossiped.</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Whoa, are you asexual? You guys have been sleeping together in the same bed for so long and still nothing? I don't believe it.\" Even Zhu Lingling seemed to be on Qin Chu's side.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Huo Mian replied, \"Liking someone means having your way with him; loving someone is learning to control yourself for him. Lingling, the deeper I feel for Qin Chu, the more hesitant I become. If it really happened between the two of us one day, I would definitely feel much more different than I do now.\"</p><p>\"I'm not trying to nag you, but it's not your first time anymore.

Have you gotten over your breakup?\" </p><p>\"I've already entered into another relationship, yay!\" Zhu Lingling proudly announced. </p><p>\"Okay, you win.\" </p><p>\"Have you not heard of that saying? 'The best way to get over a relationship is to get into a new one'.\" </p><p>\"So who is this new man of yours?\" Huo Mian thought that because of Lingling's job as a flight attendant, many people would immediately think of uniform seduction or something, so they would be biased about her work. </p><p>Plus, Zhu Lingling had attractive features, so a lot of the passengers tended to ask her for her contact information. </p><p>\"He's an heir of a rich family and not just any heir. I hear that he hangs around Su Yu and his friends a lot, and he even promised me that he'll take me to see the infamous Su Yu. I'm quite excited…\" </p><p>\"Uhm… it'll be better for you if you don't see the infamous Su Yu, you'll be disappointed.\" </p><p>\"Huh? You've met him?\" </p><p>\"He's here at the recovery center and bosses everyone around as if the whole hospital needs to worship him just to get by.\" </p><p>\"Really? Haha, tell me more, what's this Su Yu person like? Is he as good looking as he is in the photos? Is his voice sexy? Is he generous when it comes to money? Does he have tons of girlfriends? That popular star, Zhao Qingya, did she sleep with him?\" Zhu Lingling asked a ton of questions from the other end of the line. </p><p>Finally, Huo Mian only replied, \"Su Yu is super annoying and arrogant, with a terrible temper. He's not one of the so-called Four Princes, he's a T-rex that spits out fire.\"</p><p>\"Hahaha, this is the first time I've heard of someone judge Su Yu like that! You're so weird.\" </p><p>\"I'm telling the truth, believe it or not.\"</p><p>\"I know, I know, you only got eyes for your McDreamy Qin Chu right now. Other men don't satisfy you anymore.\" </p><p>After a few more back and forths with Zhu Lingling, it was time to get back to work. She signed off of WeChat and began to work. </p><p>After she got off her shift, she casually flipped through the calendar and noticed that Ning Zhiyuan's wedding was in a few days. </p><p>At dinner that night, Huo Mian asked indecisively, \"Honey, should we still go to Ning Zhiyuan and Wu Xiaoxue's wedding?\" </p><p>\"Of course, and remember to give them a hundred thousand yuan or something as a wedding gift,\" Qin Chu said casually.</p><p>\"What? That much? Are you crazy? I'm not even that close with him, why would I give him so much?\" </p><p>\"It's to tell him that your husband is rich.\" </p><p>\"So, are you showing off?\" </p><p>\"I'm trying to make him forget about you.\" </p><p>\"No, a hundred thousand is too much, why would you give him all that money?\" Huo Mian felt upset. </p><p>\"A hundred thousand is too much? Clearly, our standards and values are different. Don't fuzz over it anymore, just listen to me. I'll get the accountant to transfer you the money tomorrow, and you'll just head in, give the gift, and leave before they serve the food. Just give them the money and come back.\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded, \"I know, but there's no need for you to transfer the money to me, I've still got plenty on my card.\" </p><p>Qin Chu raised his hand and spoilingly touched Huo Mian's head. He just left a few words, \"Listen to me, good girl.\" </p><p>The next morning, not long after Qin Chu went to work, Huo Mian received a two hundred thousand yuan transfer. </p><p>How generous are you, Mr. Qin, to spend two hundred thousand so carelessly on Huo Mian's ex-boyfriend? Was he one of those people with a lot of money and a small brain? </p><p>Three days passed by quickly, and Huo Mian hesitated for quite a while before she finally decided to wear a black Chanel dress, graceful and elegant. </p><p>She arrived on the third floor of Shengjing Hotel alone… </p><p>She saw Ning Zhiyuan in a groomsman suit from far away, greeting the guests with a fake smile on his face. </p><p>Hints of pleasant surprise flashed through his eyes when he saw Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Mian…\" He called out her name the same way he used to.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":244,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:48.42","Link":"Chapter-244","NameDisplay":"Chapter 244"},{"ID":181120949488685112,"Name":"Chapter 245: Wedding Gift","NameUnsign":"Chapter 245: Wedding Gift","Description":"<p>Chapter 245: Wedding Gift</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan mostly saw Huo Mian wearing a baggy loose white coat so he was truly amazed by Huo Mian's beauty when he saw her in a black, elegant, ladylike dress.</p><p>Huo Mian's hair was not too long and only fell down to her shoulders. To match the dress, she had intentionally put up her hair with a crystal hairpin.</p><p>Even though she did not come to the wedding to take the attention away from the bride, she was not about to lose in beauty. </p><p>\"Congratulations on your wedding,\" Huo Mian said as she passed over a red envelope.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan took over the red envelope and placed it into his pocket. Then, he smiled and said, \"Thank you.\" </p><p>Huo Mian nodded and didn't say much else... </p><p>\"You are… very beautiful today.\" In his mind, Ning Zhiyuan thought that she looked even more gorgeous today than at her university convocation.</p><p>But he was too embarrassed to talk about his university days with Huo Mian because back then, their relationship was still pure and untainted. </p><p>Huo Mian was just about to speak when Wu Xiaoxue walked out with the help of her two bridesmaids.</p><p>She shouted from afar, \"Zhiyuan.\" </p><p>\"I'm sorry, excuse me for a moment. Please go in and have a seat.\" Ning Zhiyuan quickly scurried towards Wu Xiaoxue's direction.</p><p>Huo Mian turned around to walk towards the door. She did not feel like sitting down to eat and watch the ceremony. It was not that she was jealous, nor that she was unwilling to put the past down… </p><p>She only felt that she was not close friends with them to begin with, so why would she waste her time here? </p><p>Just as she walked out, she bumped into Director Wu, who was accompanied by his male assistant. </p><p>\"Huo Mian,\" Director Wu greeted. </p><p>\"Director Wu,\" Huo Mian said with a nod. </p><p>\"Have you gotten accustomed to working at South Side Recuperation Center? I heard that you are doing quite well.\" </p><p>\"Yes, I've gotten used to working there, and everyone has taken great care of me.\" </p><p>\"That's good. When I have time to go there on an inspection tour, I'll make sure to speak to you alone.\" </p><p>\"Sounds good.\" </p><p>After saying goodbye to Director Wu, Huo Mian walked out of the hotel and took a deep breath before calling Qin Chu. </p><p>\"I just came out of Ning Zhiyuan's wedding.\" </p><p>\"Okay.\" </p><p>\"He looks like a bumpkin, there's no way he can be compared to our Mr. Qin.\" </p><p>Out of the blue moon, Huo Mian started to flatter Qin Chu… and as the saying goes, 'flattery will get you anywhere'. </p><p>Her words sat well with Qin Chu… </p><p>His lips curled in satisfaction. \"It's true that not many can be compared to me.\"</p><p>\"Yes, yes,\" Huo Mian agreed with a smile. </p><p>\"Did you give them the gift money?\" Qin Chu asked again. </p><p>\"Ahem… I did, but I didn't give him the amount you told me to.\" Huo Mian decided to be forthcoming. </p><p>\"How much did you give them? 300,000 yuan?\" Qin Chu thought that she must've felt bad, so she gave them more gift money. But even if she gave them 500,000 yuan, it still wouldn't affect their family's financial situation.</p><p>\"No.\" </p><p>\"How much then? 500,000 yuan? 1 million yuan?\" Qin Chu was quite curious of how much she gave her ex.</p><p>\"200 yuan.\" </p><p>\"T- tw- two… two… two hundred yuan?\" Qin Chu repeated, not sure if he heard right. </p><p>\"Yes, two zero zero. After thinking about it, I can't bear to give them so much money. Even though you are well-off, that money belongs to us. Why should we give it to Ning Zhiyuan and Wu Xiaoxue? Ning Zhiyuan is just a friend from the university while Wu Xiaoxue is just a colleague I didn't get along with. My relationship with each of them is worth 100 yuan, so 200 yuan is good enough.\"</p><p>After hearing her words, Qin Chu chuckled... </p><p>\"What are you laughing at?\" Huo Mian was slightly resigned. </p><p>\"Good job, honey.\" The surprising amount of gift money that Huo Mian gave was quite funny to Qin Chu; it also seemed like Huo Mian truly hated the newlyweds. </p><p>After hanging up, the smile on Qin Chu's lips still remained… </p><p>Assistant Yang walked into the office with some documents. When he saw his boss's bright smile, he immediately asked, \"Boss, did something good happen today?\" </p><p>\"Yes.\" </p><p>\"Can you share it with me?\" Assistant Yang asked as he ran forward, ready to kiss some as*. </p><p>\"No.\" </p><p>\"…\" </p><p>Alright, his boss was always so willful, and today was not the first day he acted like this. Good thing that Assistant Yang was used to it already. </p><p>When Ning Zhiyuan and Wu Xiaoxue returned to the hotel to count their gift money, Wu Xiaoxue immediately took the red pocket from Ning Zhiyuan's hands when she saw Huo Mian's name on it. </p><p>\"Xiaoxue, what are you doing?\"</p><p>\"I want to see how much money your old lover gave us,\" Wu Xiaoxue said mockingly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":245,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:48.87","Link":"Chapter-245","NameDisplay":"Chapter 245"},{"ID":181120949494064415,"Name":"Chapter 246: Argument","NameUnsign":"Chapter 246: Argument","Description":"<p>Chapter 246: Argument</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue's expression darkened when she opened the red pocket and saw the two pitiful 100 yuan bills inside it. She pointed at Ning Zhiyuan and exclaimed, \"See? What did I say? You shouldn't have told her about our wedding, she only gave us 200 yuan, which is not even enough for me to eat breakfast. How can she do this? Each table at the wedding cost us 15,800 yuan, she came to eat and only gave us 200 yuan. Is she not embarrassed?\"</p><p>\"She did not stay to eat. She just left after giving me the money,\" Ning Zhiyuan refuted.</p><p>\"You're very observant, there are so many people there today but you still remember if she ate. Ning Zhiyuan, what's up with you? Do you still have feelings for her?\"</p><p>\"Xiaoxue, you're thinking too much again. If I haven't forgotten her, would I still have married you?\"</p><p>\"That's hard to say, maybe you have other motives. After all, my family bought our house and car, and your future career also depends on my Uncle. How else could a third-rate university graduate like you become a full-time employee so soon?\"</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue's words were filled with disdain towards Ning Zhiyuan. All men are prideful, so Ning Zhiyuan was quite angry to be spoken to like this by Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>\"If that was my intention, I would have gone back to Huo Mian. She is the illegitimate daughter of the Huo Family, and isn't her family better than yours?\"</p><p>\"Ha, Ning Zhiyuan, you are finally speaking the truth. Are you regretting our marriage? Then let's get a divorce, I don't want to marry you either. I'll get an abortion. I don't want to live my life with someone like you, and I know that you can only think about Huo Mian. I hate that woman, and I don't want to ever hear her name again.\"</p><p>After speaking, Wu Xiaoxue threw the 200 yuan at Ning Zhiyuan's face before leaving the room.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan sat dispiritedly on the bed, and he was not in the mood to chase after her. </p><p>Wu Xiaoxue was a classic example of a girl with 'Princess Syndrome'. Whenever she was upset, she would complain nonstop.</p><p>She did not treat Ning Zhiyuan's parents well either. Wu Xiaoxue's parents and uncle went up to the wedding stage today, but Ning Zhiyuan's parents were not invited up. Clearly, they all looked down upon his family. </p><p>His colleagues were envious of him on the surface and said that he found a good wife.</p><p>But they called him a live-in son-in-law behind his back.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was so sick of the Wu Family's wealth and influence, and Wu Xiaoxue's 'Princess Syndrome',</p><p>Thinking back, other than being less caring towards him, Huo Mian was a thousand times better than Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>After Wu Xiaoxue slammed the door and left, she sped to the nearest nightclub.</p><p>Then, she called a few of her best friends over and started drinking, despite the fact that she was pregnant.</p><p>In a corner, a woman in a sexy short skirt looked at Wu Xiaoxue meaningfully.</p><p>\"Isn't that the bride?

If we induce labor, it will be really harmful to the patient as well, and she may never be able to get pregnant again.\"</p><p>\"Yes, we know that, but the key problem is that it is difficult to save either of them right now. Dr. Wu's head is severely injured and she broke three of her left ribs. It is a very difficult operation.\"</p><p>Time was very tight, and after looking over her stats, Huo Mian said, \"Chief Wang, please fix her ribs first, and I will try to stabilize her head injuries for now. We need to keep her vitals steady to see if we can save her baby. After her condition stabilizes, we can then decide if she needs brain surgery. It seems like it's just a concussion, and it shouldn't be a big problem unless there's an intracranial hemorrhage.\"</p><p>\"Is that… okay?\" This kind of arrangement was unprecedented so the doctors did not know what to do either.</p><p>\"I'm just giving my suggestions. You are the attending physicians, you should make the final call,\" Huo Mian said.</p><p>In the end, the doctors nodded and decided to give Huo Mian's suggestion a try…</p><p>Huo Mian wanted to try her best to save Wu Xiaoxue and her baby at the same time.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that the woman who Wu Xiaoxue tried to cause trouble for at every opportunity would try so hard to save her at a crucial moment like this. </p><p>The surgery lasted 4 and a half hours, and during this entire time, Qin Chu waited in his car outside the hospital.</p><p>When Huo Mian walked out of the operating room completely exhausted, the entire corridor was filled with people. Director Wu and Wu Xiaoxue's parents were at the very front.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, how was the surgery?\"</p><p>\"They should be fine now, but we still need to follow-up and monitor her situation. The head injuries shouldn't be a big problem, and other than the three broken ribs, everything else is fine. Most importantly, the baby is safe. Over the next three months, she should stay in bed to protect the baby because we used a lot of medication today.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Huo Mian,\" Director Wu said gratefully.</p><p>\"No, I did what I'm supposed to do.\"</p><p>\"No, you definitely didn't need to.

Super-Doctor Huo's husband was the hard worker. Let's go home, I'm exhausted.\" After speaking, Huo Mian fell into a deep sleep on the passenger seat.</p><p>Everyone knew that one had to be highly focused during a surgery. The four-hour surgery was more exhausting than playing badminton for an entire day.</p><p>Qin Chu slowly drove out of the hospital; he turned down the music inside the car, fearing that it would wake up Huo Mian.</p><p>Many people once questioned why an outstanding man like Qin Chu would fall in love with an ordinary woman like Huo Mian.</p><p>…</p><p>Truth be told, he wanted to say that Huo Mian was not ordinary at all…</p><p>The dazzling light that she could instantly exude was incomparable.

You are recovering very well, and it looks like you can be discharged in about one week.\" </p><p>\"That fast?\" Su Yu was a little surprised.</p><p>\"Why? You don't want to leave?\" </p><p>\"Of course I want to leave. This place is simply suffocating, I can't drink or pick up any girls here. I'm so tired of this place.\" </p><p>\"That's great, please leave as soon as possible. I don't want to see you again, I'm so tired of taking care of you.\" </p><p>After speaking, Huo Mian immediately turned around and left.</p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment. There was only one more week until his discharge, how fast time flew. </p><p>But why was he feeling slightly sad? </p><p>When she heard that her son was going to be discharged soon, Mrs. Su brought over a few maids to prepare a sumptuous seafood meal for her son. </p><p>Even the bodyguards and nurses were able to get a little taste of a truly luxurious seafood feast. </p><p>\"Huo Mian, why didn't you go? Everyone was invited. Mrs. Su is so nice; she is beautiful and caring. She brought a bunch of 2 kg Australian lobsters braised, cooked in soups, and even seasoned with garlic; it was so luxurious. The seafood porridge was delicious too,\" one of the nurses, Tingting, said excitedly.</p><p>\"I didn't have an appetite.\" Huo Mian did not rest well last night so she was still very tired.</p><p>In the room, Su Yu looked around and pretended to not care. \"Where is Huo Mian?\" </p><p>\"Oh, she's tired so she is resting at the on-call booth. Should I call her over, Mr. Su?\" </p><p>\"No, it's okay, she's saving me money if she doesn't eat,\" Su Yu said, but his words did not match his thoughts. </p><p>- Midnight -</p><p>Perhaps it was because he ate too much seafood, but Su Yu felt a little drowsy. </p><p>His entire body felt a bit chilly... </p><p>\"Turn on the heater,\" he ordered. </p><p>One of the bodyguards immediately came in to turn on the heater. However, ten minutes later, Su Yu felt even colder. </p><p>\"Turn it up to high,\" Su Yu said impatiently. </p><p>\"Sir, I've turned it to 30 degrees Celsius, its already at its highest,\" the bodyguard replied carefully. </p><p>\"Then why is it still so cold?\" Su Yu pulled his blankets and tightly wrapped himself up in them. </p><p>The bodyguard saw that something wasn't right, so he quickly ran towards the on-call station. </p><p>Huo Mian was on duty today. She was bored so she was watching the popular Korean drama, Descendants of the Sun.</p><p>Like all the other woman, she was in love with the drama's male lead, Song Joong-ki…</p><p>Just as she was immersed in the show, she suddenly saw the bodyguard running over, \"Please take a look at Mr. Su, he doesn't look well.\" </p><p>Huo Mian stood up and followed the bodyguard to room one. </p><p>Even though it was early autumn and the nights were a bit colder, it was still too much for Su Yu to turn the heater up to 30 degrees and wrap himself up in blankets.</p><p>It was rare for him to not be in the mood to quarrel with Huo Mian. Huo Mian walked over and placed her hand on his forehead. </p><p>His temperature was shockingly hot… </p><p>\"He has a fever.\" </p><p>\"What? What should we do then?\" </p><p>\"It's okay, leave it to me.\" After speaking, Huo Mian took out a thermometer from her white coat. </p><p>\"Open your mouth.\" </p><p>\"Why?\" Su Yu dazedly opened his eyes and saw Huo Mian's pretty face. </p><p>\"So I can see what your body temperature is at.\" </p><p>\"No,\" Su Yu refused immediately. It would be embarrassing for a person his age to have his temperature measured by someone else. </p><p>Huo Mian did not wait for him to speak. She grabbed his chin and pushed the thermometer into his mouth. </p><p>Just as Su Yu was about to spit it out… Huo Mian, with her hands crossed in front of her chest, threatened fiercely, \"Don't spit it out!

He sometimes wondered if Huo Mian came to this earth to reign hell over him.</p><p>Why was he capable of flicking and dismissing other women, yet all his temper would disappear in front of her?</p><p>Did she drug him? Or maybe this woman performed some kind of black magic on him?</p><p>Huo Mian pulled up a chair and sat down by his bed, waiting to take his thermometer out.</p><p>Every once in a while, Su Yu would sneak a glance at her…</p><p>Huo Mian's head was down, as she was diligently filling out the report.</p><p>Su Yu picked up his phone, quietly turned on his camera, and turned off the sound of the shutter.</p><p>\"Huo Mian.\"</p><p>\"Mhm?\" Huo Mian looked up without thinking.</p><p>He snatched a photo of her; it was dark outside, so the lighting wasn't good and the photo was a little blurry.</p><p>However, he could still clearly see her delicate features.</p><p>Her eyesight wasn't as good at night, so she always wore black-rimmed glasses during night shifts.</p><p>The photo of that nurse in white was forever stored in Su Yu's cell phone.</p><p>He had never saved a photo of any woman before, let alone taking a photo of one himself…</p><p>\"What do you want?\" Not knowing what happened, Huo Mian asked.</p><p>\"Nothing, I just wanted to ask you what time it is.\"</p><p>\"Don't you have your phone?\" Huo Mian answered with a question of her own.</p><p>Then, she looked at the time and realized that it had been five minutes already.</p><p>She reached out to take the thermometer out from Su Yu's mouth. After taking a look she said, \"You're running a pretty high fever.\"</p><p>\"How high?\" He was curious.</p><p>\"39.8 degrees.\"</p><p>\"Almost 40 degrees? Will I become stupid from the fever?\"</p><p>\"From the way you're talking to me right now, I think we're way past stupidity.\"</p><p>Su Yu immediately rolled his eyes at Huo Mian. Are they not capable of having a nice conversation?</p><p>\"What now?\"</p><p>\"It's time to tell me if you have any last wishes...\"</p><p>Su Yu was speechless.</p><p>\"Come here, I promise I won't strangle you,\" Su Yu said, his eyes filled with fury.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled, \"You still have high spirits, you'll be fine. I'll administer physical cooling for you.\"</p><p>Then, Huo Mian turned around to leave the room. She returned five minutes later, with a bunch of random stuff on her tray.</p><p>\"Do I need to take Tylenol?\"</p><p>\"No, Tylenol has side effects, you don't want to take it unless it's absolutely necessary. It's not good for your kidney.\"</p><p>Su Yu nodded, as if he was deep in thought, \"You're right, I do need to take care of my kidney.\" (TL: kidney is related to s*x drive and power in bed in Chinese culture)</p><p>Huo Mian rolled her eyes, \"Take care of yourself and don't think about random stuff. It's no good for you.\"</p><p>\"It's the most basic human urge, you won't understand.\"</p><p>\"Fine, Mr. Stud, now I need you to shut up and lie down.\" Huo Mian pushed Su Yu's head down unreservedly.</p><p>Then, she took out a fever cooling patch and placed it on his head. He immediately felt a cold sensation; it was a nice feeling.</p><p>Then, Huo Mian handed him a popsicle, \"Eat this.\"</p><p>\"What is this.\"</p><p>\"A popsicle.\"</p><p>\"This is for women, I won't eat it. I don't like sweet stuff.\"</p><p>\"This is to help lower your temperature, treat it as medicine.\" Huo Mian threw it into Su Yu's lap.</p><p>He jumped at its temperature. \"Women, seriously…\"</p><p>\"Shh, shut it. I'm trying to watch my show.\" Huo Mian took out her headphones and turned her attention back to Descendants of the Sun.</p><p>Su Yu lied in bed with a cooling patch on his forehead. He sucked on his popsicle and continued to sneak glances at Huo Mian.</p><p>It was rare for her to sit so quietly by his side, and Su Yu suddenly wished that time would pass by a bit slower.</p><p>After another hour or so, Huo Mian finished an episode.

Then, she walked over to the ensuite kitchen and saw that all that was left was seafood.</p><p>\"Fever is a result of a chill in the body. No more seafood for the next few days, not even seafood congee. You need to eat non-oily and non-salty food.\"</p><p>\"So, after all that talk, are you going to make me something to eat?\" Su Yu looked at Huo Mian with puppy-eyes.</p><p>Huo Mian sighed, I guess I'll be a good person until the very end…</p><p>It was late at night, and she would have to wake up the chefs. Plus, the food the chefs made might be oily.</p><p>Huo Mian opened the fridge and took out some ingredients. Then, she cut up some scallions and ginger and began making Su Yu congee.</p><p>Forty minutes later, a hot bowl of fever-fighting congee was ready…</p><p>\"Here, drink this, it's good for you.\"</p><p>\"Does this enhance performance?\"</p><p>\"No, it will make you impotent,\" Huo Mian answered with a straight face.</p><p>Su Yu couldn't help but laugh; joking around with Huo Mian at this hour was one of life's pleasures.</p><p>\"You're rude, not gentle, and ugly. Guys won't fall for you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, but you don't have to worry about me. You, on the other hand, should keep it easy. If you have too much s*x, you'll soon lose your drive.\"</p><p>\"Tsk tsk, stop cursing me.\"</p><p>\"Shut up and drink your congee.\" Huo Mian was fresh out of patience.</p><p>Prince prissy-pants spiked a fever during her shift; if she failed to make him feel better, the hospital would probably be in chaos by morning.</p><p>Mrs. Su will probably yell at the head nurse until she cries.</p><p>Truth be told, the congee didn't taste good, because it reeked of ginger. Still, Su Yu, who was starving, drank the entire bowl.</p><p>It was already 2 in the morning by the time she finished dealing with him…</p><p>Exhausted, Huo Mian took off her glasses and put them in the pocket of her uniform.</p><p>\"I'll be at the on-call desk, press the button if you need me.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian.\" Su Yu stopped her as she was about to head out the door.</p><p>She turned around…</p><p>\"Nothing.\" He wanted to say 'thank you', but for some reason, the words were stuck in his throat.</p><p>Huo Mian was already used to him doing stuff like that, so she turned on her heel and left.</p><p>After Huo Mian left, Su Yu felt wide awake, so he called his four bodyguards in for an emergency meeting.</p><p>\"Tell me… what's a good present to give a woman?\"</p><p>\"Jewelry.\"</p><p>\"An expensive watch.\"</p><p>\"An LV bag.\"</p><p>\"Just give her money.\"</p><p>His four bodyguards gave him four answers…</p><p>Su Yu looked at them unhappily. \"If it were that simple, why would I be asking the four of you?

It'll be good for you.\" Su Yu looked at the tallest guy, thinking that he was a prime example of 'long limbs, small brain'.</p><p>\"Young Master, what about 999 red roses?\" another bodyguard suggested.</p><p>\"Am I a florist?\" Su Yu asked, unsatisfied with that suggestion as well.</p><p>Their ideas failed to satisfy him, so, in the end, Su Yu kicked them all out.</p><p>He laid on his bed and thought, Huo Mian isn't interested in money. I have to give her something special.</p><p>She put a lot of effort into taking care of me tonight, so I should buy her a present as a thank you.</p><p>Su Yu convinced himself….</p><p>The next morning, Huo Mian came to check up on him before her shift ended.

Before you toot your own horn, make sure you see what you're worth first.\" Huo Mian patted Su Yu on the shoulder and walked out of the room.</p><p>Su Yu seriously thought that Huo Mian was abnormal. Seriously abnormal.</p><p>He wanted to express his gratitude by buying her a present, but he couldn't even have a decent conversation with her.</p><p>When Huo Mian got off work, she changed into her own clothes. Getting into her Volkswagen CC, she backed out of her parking space and drove off.</p><p>Her driving skills were pretty good. Upstairs, Su Yu sucked on a cigarette as he watched her white car speed away. He suddenly had an idea…</p><p>Her car seemed to have inspired him… because of how sh*t it was.</p><p>Once Huo Mian got home, she was too lazy to move, so she crashed onto the couch.</p><p>Just then, Huang Yue called to tell her that Wu Xiaoxue had woken up, and her brain was functioning properly. Last night's surgery was a success, and the ultrasound today showed that her baby was okay as well.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled when she heard the news. At least their hard work had paid off.</p><p>When Qin Chu came in, he saw Huo Mian curled up in a ball on the couch.</p><p>He directly walked up to her, picked up a blanket, and covered her up.</p><p>Then, he sat down beside her, browsing the stock market… (TL: Stock market doesn't close for rich people, they after-hours and pre-market trading)</p><p>It was already 8:30 PM when she woke up…</p><p>\"Um… it's late, have you eaten?\"</p><p>\"Are you talking about midnight snack or breakfast?\"</p><p>Huo Mian scratched her head as she got up to head to the kitchen…</p><p>However, Qin Chu grabbed her arm and pulled her into his embrace…</p><p>\"You seem to be tired recently.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, night shifts are tiring.\"</p><p>\"That's why you should quit and do what you want to do. Being a nurse is too much work.\"</p><p>\"But I don't want to start my own business. I'll worry too much. This place is fine, and, plus, the hospital pays for my health insurance and retirement. I'll work there until I turn 55, then I'll be able to retire and live on the retirement money. It's a good plan.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't take much to satisfy you, does it?\" Qin Chu laughed as he pinched Huo Mian's small nose.</p><p>\"You must be hungry, I'll cook.\"</p><p>\"No, it's fine. It's late, so I already ordered delivery, and it'll be here soon.\"</p><p>As he finished his sentence, the doorbell rang. Huo Mian ran over to the door…</p><p>She took the delivery Qin Chu ordered and immediately placed it on the dining table.</p><p>\"Are we celebrating something? You ordered so much food.\" Huo Mian stared at the 8 dishes on the table, and then back at Qin Chu.</p><p>\"It's for you and all the hard work you've been doing.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Mr. Qin.\" Touched, Huo Mian wrapped her arms around Qin Chu's neck and pecked him on the cheek.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't care at all that her kiss got saliva onto his handsome face…</p><p>\"This okra dish is delicious, have some more. Medically speaking, this vegetable is high in nutrients, protects your liver, and lowers your cholesterol.\" Huo Mian kept putting food in Qin Chu's plate. She seemed to really enjoy the dishes.</p><p>Qin Chu held a bowl of food in his hands and suddenly asked, \"Mian, how much longer do I have to wait?\"</p><p>Huo Mian's hand quivered; she knew what Qin Chu was asking about.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":252,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:54.237","Link":"Chapter-252","NameDisplay":"Chapter 252"},{"ID":181120949547397599,"Name":"Chapter 253: Lambo","NameUnsign":"Chapter 253: Lambo","Description":"<p>Chapter 253: Lambo</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Right at that moment, her phone suddenly began to ring…</p><p>Huo Mian picked it up at once when she saw who was calling.

Already? Did you get a raise?\"</p><p>\"Yeah right, just that salary of mine, even if I got a raise it's not going to make a difference. That second-generation heir bought me a car, it's a black Mercedes-Benz GLK. Cool, right?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, what about your Mazda?\"</p><p>\"I gave it to my dad. He had been driving that Hyundai for years, it's time for a change.\"</p><p>\"That's good.\"</p><p>They then proceeded with some more small-talk. After Huo Mian hung up, she asked, \"What were we just talking about?\"</p><p>\"Nothing.\" Qin Chu quietly cleaned up the plates and cutlery and headed back to his study.</p><p>Huo Mian felt incredibly guilty since she was always purposely avoiding that topic.</p><p>She didn't know how to answer and was afraid that her answer would upset Qin Chu. Therefore, she decided to play dumb.</p><p>But, how much longer could she pretend? Will Qin Chu lose patience in her one day?</p><p>When Huo Mian arrived at work the next day, she saw a group of people gathered around the entrance.</p><p>Curious, she walked over to find out what was going on…</p><p>People dispersed automatically at the sight of Huo Mian; then, she saw a bright pink Lamborghini parked in front of her.</p><p>It was brand new; she could tell that it was straight out of the factory…</p><p>\"Woah, whose high-profile car is it?\"</p><p>Huo Mian knew that this pink Lamborghini was a limited world edition and not mass-manufactured.</p><p>She also knew that Hilton Hotel's heiress, Paris Hilton, owned one. At the time, the U.S media reported it non-stop, and all the girls in the world were crazy jealous.</p><p>However, this was not just any other pink Lamborghini – the car was covered in crystals.</p><p>The car itself shone and twinkled, hurting everyone's eyes…</p><p>\"Is it pretty?\"</p><p>\"It is.\" Huo Mian nodded. Then, she realized that it was Su Yu talking to her.</p><p>No wonder he wasn't sleeping in; did he wake up this early just to show off his wealth?</p><p>Just as she was wondering, Su Yu said, \"It's for you.\"</p><p>Then, he took out the key to the car and shoved it into Huo Mian's hand…</p><p>\"Um… what's going on?\" Huo Mian was a little dumbfounded.</p><p>\"You should throw away that Volkswagen. Look at the other cars parked here, yours is the cheapest. So, this is my present to you. Do you like it?\"</p><p>\"Why are you giving this to me?\" Huo Mian stared at Su Yu.</p><p>Su Yu was a little shy that everyone was watching them. \"Because throughout my time here, your injection technique is the best. Of course, I wasn't going to let you do all that work for nothing in return.\"</p><p>\"I don't want it,\" Huo Mian said as she shoved the car keys back into Su Yu's hand.</p><p>\"Why not?\"</p><p>\"I can't take what I didn't earn. Taking care of you is within the scope of my responsibilities. You can't give me something this expensive, it's not like it's just a box of cookies or a pound of meat.\" Then, Huo Mian turned around to go into the hospital.</p><p>The nurses around them began hating her guts…</p><p>They all thought that Huo Mian was an idiot.</p><p>Su Yu, rejected in public, was embarrassed. \"What are you all looking at? Go on with your lives.\"</p><p>Then, he kicked the Lamborghini as hard as he could, causing everyone to look at the car with pain in their eyes…</p><p>It seemed like one could literally do anything when they were crazy rich.</p><p>He had to buy this car from his friend. Not only did he pay 15 million yuan for it, but he also had to give up the two bottles of Laffite that he had stored for years…</p><p>But that woman rejected him… Seriously?!</p><p>After Huo Mian arrived at the on-call station and changed into her uniform, she saw one of the nurses, Nannan, run over. Nannan said mysteriously, \"Huo Mian, why didn't you accept it? Do you know how much that car costs? It's not just any other Lamborghini, it's an LP670—4 SV, limited world edition. It was designed by a Japanese prodigy designer and paved with Swarovski diamonds.

If the director finds out, he might be suspicious of my work ethics and fire me.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, don't be such a fool. If I were you, I would definitely seize this opportunity.\"</p><p>\"That's why Su Yu's not into you.\" Huo Mian felt bad for nurses like Nannan.</p><p>Many women worshipped money and dreamt of marrying rich. However, the more you wanted something, the harder it was to get.</p><p>The more desperate a person was, the fewer opportunities he or she would have…</p><p>Plus, she knew that there wasn't a man in the world who would fall in love with someone who only loved money and had an ulterior motive.</p><p>Even if he were the ugliest man in the world, he would rather believe that his girlfriend loved him for who he was, and not for the money in his bank.</p><p>Nannan was rendered speechless by what Huo Mian said…</p><p>During the lunch break, after she had lunch, Huo Mian sat in the garden and played with her phone.</p><p>It was Chinese Valentine's Day, so a lot of her friends were showing off the red pocket money their boyfriends gave them on their WeChat friend circles. Some were 1314 yuan, which meant 'together forever', others were 520 yuan, which meant 'I love you'.</p><p>Anyways, people were all bragging about their relationships…</p><p>Even Zhu Lingling posted a photo her and her boyfriend on WeChat, along with a transfer of 5210 yuan.</p><p>Brutal…</p><p>After she exclaimed at what she saw, she posted on her WeChat friend circle.</p><p>She wrote, \"Girls who received red pocket money from their boyfriends and husbands today, do you know where the money came from? How dare they secretly stash away so much money?!\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling immediately replied, \"You're just jealous! Didn't your lover, McDreamy Qin, send you one?\"</p><p>Just as Huo Mian was about to reply, she heard a 'ding' on her phone; she had received a WeChat money transfer.</p><p>It was from Qin Chu. Huo Mian began counting the digits – one, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand…</p><p>\"Um… 131,400 yuan.\"</p><p>Wasn't this 'together forever' a little too luxurious?</p><p>Huo Mian took a screenshot of the transfer and sent it to Zhu Lingling.</p><p>On the other end, Zhu Lingling immediately replied, \"Friendship over. Don't reply.\"</p><p>\"Hahaha, now it's your turn to be jealous, ayy~ (Insert Lenny Face Here)\"</p><p>Huo Mian just felt a sense of achievement…</p><p>Then, she replied to Qin Chu, \"Good husbands never hide money behind his wife's back.\"</p><p>\"I'll ask my lawyer to transfer assets and GK to your name.\"</p><p>\"Um… your dad will probably cut you up.\"</p><p>\"No, but he'll probably cut you up,\" Qin Chu replied.</p><p>Huo Mian, \"…\"</p><p>\"Stop pulling my leg, Master Qin.\"</p><p>\"I'm serious! You don't believe that I'll give you GK?\"</p><p>\"I do, I just don't believe that your dad will cut me up,\" Huo Mian replied matter-of-factly.</p><p>Qin Chu fell silent…</p><p>After a while, Huo Mian sent him another message, \"Mr. Husband.\"</p><p>\"Yeah?\"</p><p>\"What kind of bank account are you using? You can transfer so much at once, I can only transfer 10,000 yuan each time. What's your bank? I want to apply for the same one.\"</p><p>\"Dubai First Royal Bank, black MasterCard.\"</p><p>\"The name sounds fancy.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, this card is coated in gold and decorated with diamonds. There's no limit, so the card owner can spend as much as they want to.\"</p><p>\"Okay, you win.\"</p><p>\"I'll apply for a secondary card for you.\"</p><p>\"No, no, I have enough money. I'm scared that I'll trick you out of all your money…\"</p><p>\"Go ahead, it's yours anyway. I don't care.\"</p><p>\"Mr. Moneybags, let's be friends,\" Huo Mian joked.</p><p>\"Sure, but as a show of good faith, you'll need to have a baby with me first.\"</p><p>\"Get out of here.\"</p><p>The couple joked around with each other, enjoying each other's presence and perhaps taking things a little too far…</p><p>Huo Mian's mood got a lot better after her WeChat conversation with Qin Chu. She stood up, put her phone back into her pocket, and headed back in while humming a song.</p><p>Upstairs, Su Yu saw Huo Mian's happy expression and was almost positive that she had a boyfriend.</p><p>However, why is it that after so much time and effort tracking that person down, he still found nothing? Was it… intentionally hidden?</p><p>This man was powerful enough to stop Su Yu's men from finding him?</p><p>\"Young Master, Miss Zhao Qingya is here.\"</p><p>\"Tell her to come in.\" Su Yu turned around, his expression as cold as it always was.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":254,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:55.55","Link":"Chapter-254","NameDisplay":"Chapter 254"},{"ID":18112094956818995,"Name":"Chapter 255: Regifting","NameUnsign":"Chapter 255: Regifting","Description":"<p>Chapter 255: Regifting</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"President Su…\" Zhao Qingya was one of the hottest female celebrities in the industry. After taking part in three harem-fighting TV shows, she quickly became one of the four most bankable young actresses in Mainland China. She had a pure, sweet look, and was apparently only 24 years old, the same age as Huo Mian.</p><p>It only took her three years to go from newbie to stardom; her fame had everything to do with Imperial Star Entertainment.</p><p>Rumor had it that she disregarded her own life to stop Su Yu's car, which gave her a chance towards fame.</p><p>If it weren't for Su Yu's stellar driving skills, and if he didn't step on his brakes fast enough, Zhao Qingya would have died at the scene.</p><p>Not a lot of people were capable of doing what she did. It was her courage that sparked Su Yu's interest.</p><p>As one of Su Yu's many girlfriends, Zhao Qingya was one of the more favored ones. She was obedient and knew her place, so Su Yu kept her by his side for the past three years. She became immensely successful in the entertainment world, and no one else had the guts to do anything to her.</p><p>Those who didn't know all thought that this girl had a hefty background; perhaps she was a second-generation heiress.</p><p>Those who did know were all aware that she was no more than Su Yu's play toy, one that could be abandoned at any time.</p><p>Su Yu turned around but didn't say anything…</p><p>She immediately put down her Chanel bag and strutted over to him. Then, she held his arm and helped him onto the bed.</p><p>\"I just came back from filming out of town. I heard that you'll be discharged soon, that's good news.\" Zhao Qingya's voice was sweet and childlike.</p><p>\"Yeah.\" Seemingly disinterested, Su Yu only responded with one word.</p><p>\"When I was filming in Nanling, I saw this really cool lighter, so I bought you one. It's really unique and is modeled after an antique.\"</p><p>Zhao Qingya reached into her bag and took out the lighter, which she presented to Su Yu like it was a rare treasure.</p><p>Su Yu took it in his hand and lit it up twice. His face showed no emotions at all.</p><p>\"The premiere of my new movie is next month, can you come?\" Zhao Qingya looked at Su Yu coquettishly.</p><p>\"We'll see.\"</p><p>Zhao Qingya nodded… Su Yu looked like he was in a bad mood, so she didn't dare say anything else.</p><p>\"Didn't you say that you liked that pink Lamborghini? The one outside is yours to take.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" Zhao Qingya didn't think that Su Yu would say something like this, so she was dumbfounded.</p><p>When she was walking in, she did see a diamond-plated pink Lamborghini by the entrance. At the time she wondered who the lucky woman was.</p><p>So it was Su Yu's car…</p><p>\"It's for me?\" Zhao Qingya asked in disbelief.</p><p>\"Yeah, you can have it.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, President Su.\" Zhao Qingya quickly pecked Su Yu on the cheek.</p><p>Su Yu immediately wiped her scented lip gloss off his face with a tissue.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Mr. Su, I'm just too happy… thank you for the generous present.\"</p><p>\"You can drive it away later.\" Su Yu's tone was grim, he didn't seem to be in much of a mood.</p><p>\"Thank you, President Su.\" Zhao Qingya thanked him again, obviously getting emotional.</p><p>She could almost see the media taking photos of her in that car. She was bound to make headlines.</p><p>By then, all of the women in the entertainment circle would all be crazy jealous of her, all because she was fortunate enough to work under Su Yu.</p><p>It was true that Su Yu had a bad temper. Most of the time, she felt like she was tending to the emperor; she had to be extremely careful not to make a mistake.</p><p>However, compared to what she got in return, it all seemed worth it…</p><p>The wealth and fame that Su Yu gave her was something that most women could never even dream of in their lifetime.</p><p>Seeing the unconcealable happiness on Zhao Qingya's face, Su Yu was surer than ever – women all loved luxurious things.</p><p>But why was Huo Mian an exception?</p><p>Why couldn't she be obedient like Zhao Qingya?</p><p>Zhao Qingya spent three hours in Su Yu's room. When she left, she purposely touched up her makeup.</p><p>When she passed by the on-call station, she glanced at Huo Mian and asked, \"Are you Huo Mian?\"</p><p>\"I am.\"</p><p>\"I heard that you were the nurse who has been taking care of Young Master Su during his time at the hospital.\" Zhao Qingya heard from others that during Su Yu's hospital stay, he treated a nurse called 'Huo Mian' differently from the rest. She could understand – a person like Su Yu would only fool around with a nurse for fun. He wasn't going to get serious about her.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>\"As his girlfriend, I would like to thank you for taking care of my boyfriend. I bought this wallet a few days ago and barely used it. Consider it as my gift to you.\" Before Huo Mian could respond, Zhao Qingya threw a Prada wallet in front of her, as if she was being nice to a beggar.</p><p>\"One second, Miss Zhao,\" Huo Mian called her from behind.</p><p>\"Do you want an autograph or a photo together?\" Zhao Qingya turned around, asking arrogantly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":255,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:56.083","Link":"Chapter-255","NameDisplay":"Chapter 255"},{"ID":181120949566822202,"Name":"Chapter 256: Something Good","NameUnsign":"Chapter 256: Something Good","Description":"<p>Chapter 256: Something Good</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Um… neither. You can have the wallet back, I can't accept this.\" Huo Mian picked up the wallet and shoved it back into Zhao Qingya's hands.</p><p>\"Does hospital policy forbid you from accepting presents? It's okay, this isn't a bribe. It's just my present to you.\"</p><p>\"No, it's me. But thank you, Miss Zhao, for the kind thought.\"</p><p>Zhao Qingya grasped the wallet in her hand with mixed emotions. She thought that if she showed off her relationship with Su Yu in front of the nurse, the little nurse would be scared by the competition and back down. After all, Zhao Qingya was the only one who Su Yu dated for all these years.</p><p>However, did the nurse's unwillingness to accept her present mean that she wasn't planning on letting go of Su Yu? Did she want even more from him?</p><p>At that thought, Zhao Qingya's face went grim as she looked Huo Mian up and down. \"I thought you were a smart girl that knows her place, but it turns out that you're just an idiot who was dreaming of climbing up the ladder. You're not the most beautiful girl in the world nor are you from a wealthy family, so I'm not sure where you got the confidence to keep chasing after Su Yu. Smart women should know when to retreat in the face of a rapid torrent. I suggest that you move aside before he gets sick of you, or else your life will become worse when he dumps you. If you accidentally piss him off, you might not even be able to keep living in C City. Therefore, you should back down, or do you really want to compete against me? Unless… you think you're prettier than me and can become more popular?\"</p><p>Huo Mian sighed slightly at Zhao Qingya's hostile remarks…</p><p>She wondered why women always viewed men as the most important things in their lives.</p><p>Did they have no sense of 'self'?</p><p>\"Ms. Zhao, I think you misunderstood. Su Yu and I…\"</p><p>\"I don't care what's going on between you and Su Yu. He has so many women that I'm used to it. It's just… I want to remind you not to have your hopes up. An ordinary woman is incapable of tying him down. You should tread carefully…\" Then, Zhao Qingya put on her sunglasses, turned on her heels, and left.</p><p>Huo Mian looked at her speechlessly…</p><p>That's what Huo Siqian told her, and now Zhao Qingya was telling her the exact same thing.</p><p>The problem was, why did they think that something's going on between Su Yu and her? She thought that her attitude towards Su Yu was much worse than her attitude towards the old man in room 2. At least she always smiled at Mr. Liu, treated him politely, and played Chinese chess with him.</p><p>Zhao Qingya left with the pink Lamborghini… and she made it onto the entertainment headlines that very evening.</p><p>\"Imperial Star's Big Boss Spent More than Ten Million on a Limited-Edition Lamborghini for Zhao Qingya; Their Relationship is Stable, and Wedding Date is Near.\"</p><p>The media had been reporting on Zhao Qingya and Su Yu's possible wedding for a long time now; ever since Zhao Qingya's debut, the public relations team had been playing on this rumor, and Zhao Qingya never provided any formal explanations. However, every time news like this broke out, it added to Zhao Qingya's value as well as Imperial Star's stock prices. Therefore, Su Yu silently allowed for these rumors.</p><p>After all, Zhao Qingya was pushed to stardom by Imperial Star alone…</p><p>But those in the industry knew that it was just fake news. With Zhao Qingya's family background, there was no way she was going to become Mrs. Su.</p><p>Su Yu's grandfather used to be the chief of a military district and was extremely strict. He once announced that his granddaughter-in-law could work in any profession, so long as she didn't work in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Apparently, Su Yu was incredibly obedient to his grandfather. Therefore, news like that was purely for entertainment and not to be taken too seriously.</p><p>During Huo Mian's night shift that evening, Nannan protested as she read the newspaper, \"See, Mr. Su regifted what you didn't want. Ten million, it's worth ten million yuan… It's such a shame, even I feel bad for you.\"</p><p>\"It wasn't mine to begin with, you don't have to feel bad.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"You are one weird person. I can't believe you can stay unmoved in the face of money and power. You must really love your boyfriend.\" Nannan looked at Huo Mian as if she failed to convince Huo Mian to do what she thought was the right thing to do.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled again but didn't directly answer.</p><p>Even if she hadn't married Qin Chu, she still wouldn't date Su Yu…</p><p>She hated the power struggle within rich families and refused to even return to the Huo family. Of course, she wasn't about to marry into the Su family, another enterprise mogul.</p><p>During her shift, the patient in room 2 suddenly pressed the emergency alarm.</p><p>Huo Mian ran over in fear that something bad happened to Mr. Liu.</p><p>However, when she went in she realized that not only was Grandpa Liu fine and chewing on an apple, there was an elder woman, around the same age as Mr. Liu, standing beside him. She was wearing a traditional dress and had gentle features. Huo Mian knew that she was Mr. Liu's wife; apparently, she just returned from her daughter's home in Hawaii. Huo Mian had previously seen her in Mr. Liu's photos, so she looked familiar.</p><p>\"Grandpa Liu, what's wrong?\" Huo Mian looked at them, flabbergasted.</p><p>\"Come here, Huo, come and sit down. We have something good to announce,\" Mr. Liu said mysteriously.</p><p>\"Um…something good?\" Suspicious, Huo Mian looked at the old couple.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":256,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:56.683","Link":"Chapter-256","NameDisplay":"Chapter 256"},{"ID":181120949572755408,"Name":"Chapter 257: Reliable","NameUnsign":"Chapter 257: Reliable","Description":"<p>Chapter 257: Reliable</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Grandpa Liu put down the unfinished apple, smiled, and looked at Huo Mian, \"Seeing that you took great care of me over the past few days, played Chinese chess with me, and administered my medications, my wife and I talked about it, and decided to introduce you to someone. I've been watching you, Huo Mian. You're a good girl and the most reliable nurse at this hospital. You're down to earth and not pompous, unlike most of the young people out there today.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, my husband kept telling me how good a girl you are, and I believe in his opinion.\"</p><p>\"Um, wait, Grandpa Liu, I actually…\"</p><p>\"Don't say anything yet, listen to me. My own grandson is already married, so that's too bad, but my fourth brother has a grandson who is around your age, and he is a really reliable man. He is a company commander in the air force. He is young and accomplished, and, most importantly, he'll be promoted in the foreseeable future. He lives in S City. Once you guys get married, it's fine if you don't want to live there. You can continue living here; the distance between the two cities is short, so it won't matter.\"</p><p>The more Huo Mian listened, the more bewildered she felt. What was this? She hadn't even met him, and they were already talking about marriage?</p><p>Moreover, she was already married! Wasn't Grandpa Liu shooting cupid arrows at the wrong people?</p><p>Huo Mian shot up, \"Grandpa Liu, I'm sorry, but I'm…\"</p><p>\"I know that you're shy, so I asked that young man to come tomorrow. When he comes, you can get to know each other. You're both young and will have a lot to talk about. If things work out? Great. If not, then you guys can be friends.\"</p><p>Grandpa Liu sure had an open mind. His wife agreed, \"That's right, that kid is definitely reliable, just a little old fashioned is all. Don't worry, we won't trick you.\"</p><p>\"I know you are doing this out of kindness, but the thing is I'm already…\"</p><p>\"Hey, turn on the TV, we can't miss the news broadcast.\" Mr. Liu slapped his forehead and then began looking for the remote.</p><p>His wife also began busying about, and just like that, the couple ignored Huo Mian's protest…</p><p>Huo Mian quietly left his room; it seemed that she had to take part in another blind date…</p><p>If Mr. Qin found out, he would probably kill her… she shuddered at that thought.</p><p>- The next morning -</p><p>The guy Mr. Liu wanted to introduce to Huo Mian arrived at the hospital before she even finished up her night shift.</p><p>To make the atmosphere more like that of a date, Mr. Liu made them go take a walk in the park so they could get to know each other.</p><p>\"Hi, my name is Liu Ji.\" The 180 cm tall man with dark skin and a square face introduced himself.</p><p>\"Hi, I'm…\"</p><p>\"You're Huo Mian, right? My grandpa told me about you, he said that you're a really special girl.\"</p><p>\"Um… I'm really not, my temper isn't as good as the other nurses. I'm impatient.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"That's a good thing, people who are impatient are usually punctual. I hate people who are late. In the army, no one can be late, not even for a second.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I heard Mr. Liu mention that you're a company commander. It's impressive.\"</p><p>\"It's not, my military title is the lowest in my family. My goal is to become a regimental commander.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded… She didn't know what else to say; it was awkward.</p><p>\"What do you think about me? To tell you the truth, I don't have time for relationships in the army, so once I see someone I like, I immediately ask them what they think.

His sentences were all capable of rendering people speechless, and Huo Mian almost laughed out loud at them.</p><p>After she explained the situation to him, they headed back and on their way, bumped into Su Yu by the entrance.</p><p>\"Is this… a blind date?\"</p><p>Su Yu was taking a stroll when he heard a few gossipy nurses laugh at the fact that Huo Mian was on a blind date.</p><p>He was so furious that he lost the will to walk around and headed straight to the garden…</p><p>Before Huo Mian could answer, Su Yu glanced at the military strap on square-faced army dude's shoulder and broke into laughter, \"You're just a company commander?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I'm a company commander.\" The square-faced army dude nodded.</p><p>\"Um, I…\" Huo Mian, unwilling to stay longer, tried to say something.</p><p>However, Su Yu immediately commented impolitely, \"I can't believe a lowly captain is looking to get some at South Side. Who gave you the audacity to do so? Do you know how much the patients here earn every month? More than you will earn in a lifetime!\"</p><p>\"Su Yu… you're taking it too far.\" Huo Mian warned him with a long face. This square-faced army guy was Mr. Liu's brother's son, mocking him wasn't necessary.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, this must be your boyfriend. But… I really think you should reconsider dating him. Petty men usually don't have bright futures.\" With that, the square-face army dude nodded at Huo Mian and left…</p><p>Usually, if someone said something like that, Su Yu would have burst into flames from fury. Yet today, he was abnormally calm.</p><p>That was because that army dude thought he was Huo Mian's boyfriend, which made him happy.</p><p>Furious, Huo Mian turned around to leave, but Su Yu, thick-skinned, blocked her exit…</p><p>\"Don't stand in my way like a pig, go away,\" Huo Mian said angrily.</p><p>Su Yu raised an eyebrow, \"Pig? I'm more like a dog, don't you think?\"</p><p>\"I think dogs are better than you. Dogs are man's best friend. However, you're obviously not.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I'm in a good mood today, so I won't take what you said into account. You're forgiven.\"</p><p>\"But I'm not in a good mood today. Move! My shift is over, I'm heading home.\"</p><p>\"Hey, seriously... Wait, I have something to say.\"</p><p>\"Hurry up, I don't have much time.\" Huo Mian looked down at her watch. She wanted to go home early. If she left right away, she would still have time to make Qin Chu a delicious breakfast.</p><p>\"I'll be discharged in a few days,\" Su Yu said as his face suddenly became all serious.</p><p>He was a special patient who never wore the patient clothing because he thought that it was too degrading.</p><p>He wore different luxury brands every day. Paired with his gorgeous face, the female nurses at South Side were usually mesmerized his handsomeness.</p><p>If he accidentally looked one of them in the eye, that nurse would be fawning over that look all day.</p><p>Huo Mian never really looked at what Su Yu wore, because her attention was never on him.</p><p>However, today she stood in front of him and the sun shined right at his position, making it hard for her to ignore him.</p><p>Unlike Qin Chu, Su Yu enjoyed wearing white, light coffee, beige, white beige… anything that was bright. These colors looked exceptionally handsome on him.</p><p>He was wearing a custom-made Salvatore Ferragamo shirt; it was simple yet elegant.</p><p>Men like Su Yu were born with a natural aura. Even if he wore a 20-dollar shirt bought at a vendor by the street, people would still mistake it for being worth hundreds of thousands.</p><p>\"Congrats, it's about time,\" Huo Mian immediately responded.</p><p>\"Before I leave, I wanted to tell you something.\"</p><p>\"Hurry.\" Puzzled, Huo Mian stared at Su Yu; he was a little weird today.</p><p>Su Yu cleared his throat, obviously a little nervous. He had gotten used to women throwing themselves at him and had never expressed his feelings toward a girl before, so he wasn't sure what to do.</p><p>\"Seriously dude, if you're not going to say anything, then I'm going to leave.\" Huo Mian lost her patience when she saw Su Yu's hesitation.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, do you want to date me? I'll be good to you.\"</p><p>Su Yu immediately looked the other way after saying this; he was scared to look into Huo Mian's eyes.</p><p>Huo Mian, who was just about to leave, suddenly stopped in her tracks…</p><p>Was Su Yu… confessing to her?</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":258,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:57.867","Link":"Chapter-258","NameDisplay":"Chapter 258"},{"ID":181120949584344645,"Name":"Chapter 259: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (1)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 259: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (1)","Description":"<p>Chapter 259: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (1)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>This was Su Yu's first time asking someone out, so he said it with reserve.

If you cheat, you'll be called a cheating asshole, so, for your own image, you really shouldn't.\"</p><p>\"Those aren't actual girlfriends; at most, they're women.\" Su Yu was clear to draw the line.</p><p>All these years, including Zhao Qingya, his relationship with those women was just a combination of money and s*x.</p><p>He was just looking for a way out of boredom and loneliness and didn't really fall in love with anyone, so he was just playing games.</p><p>Therefore, he didn't think that he was cheating; on the other hand, he thought Huo Mian was making too big of a deal out of it.</p><p>\"Oh, maybe I'm not up to date with stuff like this, but I have a boyfriend, and I don't want to be called a cheating b*tch. Most importantly, I won't leave him. We are in love and have a stable relationship. Thank you for your kindness, I hope that you can live a healthy life and be happy in your work.\"</p><p>Then, Huo Mian turned on her heels and left…</p><p>Live a healthy life? Be happy in your work? She was weird, does she have to be so unique, even in her rejection? Su Yu's entire face fell. The first time he expressed his feelings towards a girl, he felt as if someone poured a bucket of ice water down his back…</p><p>After he returned to his room, Su Yu, unhappy, took out his phone and typed in a WeChat group filled with close friends, \"What should I do if a girl I like has a boyfriend?\"</p><p>\"Make her sleep with you. That's how people fall in love,\" one of his buddies replied.</p><p>\"Steal her, no one in C City is your match. You have more money and better looks.\"</p><p>\"Offer her boyfriend money and make him back off. That'll give you a chance.\"</p><p>\"Just ask her what she wants and fulfill all her wishes. By then, she'll want to sleep with you.\"</p><p>Although all his buddies had a point, Su Yu didn't think that any of those methods would work on Huo Mian.</p><p>Make her sleep with him? That was degrading to him – he was good looking and had a hefty background. Did he really need to force somebody to sleep with him?</p><p>It would be such an embarrassment if other people found out.</p><p>Steal her? That was too over-the-top; plus, with Huo Mian's personality, she would probably end up hating him. What kind of future would they have then?</p><p>Give her boyfriend money? Su Yu immediately eliminated that option. He didn't know what Huo Mian's boyfriend did for a living, as he had yet to find out anything about him. That alone means that he was definitely someone with a hefty background; would he really accept Su Yu's money?</p><p>As for fulfilling all her wishes… he had tried that already; Huo Mian laughed at him and called him a genie…</p><p>Therefore, nothing would work, and all the above suggestions were moot…</p><p>\"What's going on? Did the prettiest girl on this earth appear in C City? Did she break Big Boy Su's heart?\" one of his buddies gossiped.</p><p>As one of the four princes, Wei Liao was close to Su Yu. He sent a smirking emoji to the group when he saw Su Yu's question.</p><p>Then, he wrote, \"Men aren't loyal. If they are, it's because the temptation isn't enough. Women aren't loyal either. If they are, it's because you haven't offered her enough to betray her boyfriend. If you offer her enough, you'll succeed.\"</p><p>After Su Yu saw this, he thought about it and became even more depressed…</p><p>After his discharge, it would be much harder for him to see Huo Mian…</p><p>After Huo Mian got off work, she was going to head back to Imperial Park when Zhixin called her. She immediately went to his school.</p><p>Zhixin stood before a yellow sports car; he looked distracted.</p><p>\"Sis, is my car pretty?\"</p><p>\"Where did you get it?\" Huo Mian frowned, a little unhappy.</p><p>\"A few days ago, a company sponsored an electric car designing competition, and my design won first place. This is the prize the company gave me.\"</p><p>\"Isn't that a good thing? Why is your expression weird?\" Huo Mian saw right through her brother.</p><p>Zhixin looked down. After a moment's thought, he said, \"Sis, I don't want to lie to you. The sponsor… is GK.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's expression changed when she heard what he said…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":259,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:58.433","Link":"Chapter-259","NameDisplay":"Chapter 259"},{"ID":181120949589024820,"Name":"Chapter 260: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (2)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 260: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (2)","Description":"<p>Chapter 260: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (2)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Don't be mad, sis.

Big Brother Qin Chu?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"No, Qin Chu's assistant helped me with the registration materials when I went today. Honestly, Sis, my design wasn't so great, but it still managed to win. Everyone said that I lucked out big time. I'm not a natural-born genius like you are, and no matter how hard I try, my grades are only average, so I thought that me winning this award had something to do with you. I thought that… Big Brother Qin Chu still likes you, and he wanted to use this opportunity to get closer to you.\"</p><p>Huo Mian sighed after she heard what he said. She really wanted to tell Zhixin that she was already with Qin Chu.</p><p>However, she was scared that it would stress Zhixin out if he knew. So after some thought, she chose not to talk about it.</p><p>\"This car is the model from the Transformers movie, right?\" Huo Mian asked as she looked at the sports car.</p><p>Jing Zhixin nodded aggressively, \"Yes, it's Bumblebee, my favorite. It's the Chevrolet Camaro from the Transformers series. It's my favorite car, and I didn't know that Qin Chu would know my taste so well, it's amazing.\"</p><p>\"How much does this cost?\"</p><p>\"I think it's about four hundred thousand or so on the market, so I didn't have the guts to keep it. Why don't you give it back to Qin Chu for me?\" Jing Zhixin might love cars, but he knew what he should and shouldn't take, especially because of the special relationship between his sister and Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Leave the car here, for now, don't drive it away just yet. I'll figure out what to do with it later.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\"</p><p>\"Sis, you've lost weight! Are you exhausted from work lately?\" Jing Zhixin looked at Huo Mian, who had just got off her night shift, with hints of sympathy.</p><p>She had dark circles around her eyes and looked quite broken down from all the late nights, but she didn't even notice it herself.</p><p>\"I'm fine, just take care of yourself. Have you been having headaches lately?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"What about the medicine, are you still taking it?\"</p><p>\"I am, there are only two kinds left.\"</p><p>\"Okay, keep taking it, it's good for your recovery.\"</p><p>\"Sis, why don't you move back? Mom has nagged me about it several times; she says that renting outside costs a lot for you, and it would be better if you just come back and live at home. I know that she wants you back, not because it saves money, but because it would be great if all three of us lived together.\"</p><p>\"Let's talk about this later, I'm heading back now, call me if you need anything.\" She didn't stay long and drove home soon after.</p><p>After she cleaned up, she took a nap until evening, when she was awakened by the sound of the door opening.</p><p>\"Did you arrange for Zhixin's car to be delivered?\" she asked impatiently as he entered.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Why didn't you run it by me?\"</p><p>\"I told you already,\" Qin Chu said nonchalantly...</p><p>The fact was, he really did mention it once before, but Huo Mian never agreed to it.</p><p>\"But I never agreed.\"</p><p>\"It's not for you, so does your agreement matter so much?\"</p><p>Huo Mian, \"….\"</p><p>Huo Mian sighed slightly and sat down beside Qin Chu, \"You can't do this. He's only a student, you can't spoil him.\"</p><p>\"I wasn't spoiling him, that's why I picked such an inexpensive car. If I was really spoiling him, I would've bought him a Porsche.\"</p><p>\"Qin…\" Just as Huo Mian said one word, Qin Chu raised his head to stare at her with an upset look.</p><p>She immediately changed her tone, \"Honey, you're really going to spoil him rotten.\"</p><p>\"He's your brother, which means he's also my brother. What's wrong with spoiling him?\"</p><p>Clearly, if one man got his way, he would do anything he liked, but Huo Mian understood Qin Chu's way of \"love her, love her dog\" mentality thoroughly.</p><p>\"But your methods will make him think that he'll just get things without working for them.\"</p><p>\"Then he won't have to work for them. Plus, we don't need him to work after he graduates, he can do whatever he wants. Just let him.\"</p><p>\"You can't do that, he's a man, and he has to have a sense of responsibility.\"</p><p>\"You know your brother's personality better than I do. That child is innocent and kind, nothing will happen to him just because of a car. Don't get crazy ideas.\"</p><p>\"But…\" Huo Mian wanted to say something else, but she was cut off by Qin Chu.</p><p>\"I'm hungry. Honey, can you make me some dinner?\"</p><p>Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian, and she finally admitted defeat...</p><p>She ran to the kitchen, and Qin Chu smiled in victory. He was very good at changing the subject.</p><p>During dinner, Huo Mian said casually, \"Zhixin mentioned that he wants me to move back with them today.\"</p><p>\"So that little kid is paying back my kindness with vengeance?\" Qin Chu's face turned grim. His brother-in-law just took his car, and now he wants to steal his wife back?

If you think that it's too luxurious, you're welcome to switch cars with him.\"</p><p>Huo Mian immediately stopped talking. She already thought that a Volkswagen was luxurious enough for her, so how could she switch to a yellow sports car?</p><p>The nurses at South Side would talk about her until their spit drowned her. By then, they would definitely think that she found herself a sugar daddy if she were to switch to a new car.</p><p>So she might as well not discuss Zhixin's new car with Qin Chu anymore.</p><p>However, if Qin Chu wasn't worried that Huo Mian would be unhappy, he would have happily given Jing Zhixin a Porsche.</p><p>Otherwise, if someone were to find out that his brother-in-law drove a car that was only a few hundred thousand yuan, wouldn't he feel embarrassed?</p><p>Yes, he would have to slowly convince Huo Mian into getting him another car.</p><p>Next time, he would do more research. First, he needed to find his wife another car, or else he would feel very uncomfortable every time he saw Huo Mian's Volkswagen.</p><p>After dinner, Huo Mian took a shower and got into bed…</p><p>She had been staying up too late recently and never slept well. As a result, the dark circles around her eyes were becoming increasingly obvious.</p><p>She walked over to the washroom cabinet and put on the eye cream Qin Chu previously prepared for her.</p><p>Finally, she lied down in bed…</p><p>Qin Chu worked quite late in his study, and, after he arrived at Huo Mian's bedroom, he was surprised to see Huo Mian was still awake.</p><p>She was watching a variety show on her phone.</p><p>\"You didn't sleep yet?\"</p><p>\"No, I slept too much during the day.\"</p><p>\"Your circadian rhythm is completely messed up.\" Qin Chu felt sympathetic, and then he got onto the bed and naturally placed his arm around Huo Mian's shoulders.</p><p>\"You finished working? You must be exhausted.\"</p><p>\"I've gotten used to it, it's just work.\"</p><p>\"You haven't been back recently, so won't your parents be upset?\" Huo Mian asked carefully.</p><p>\"If I go, then you'll be home alone, and I'll be worried. It's fine if I just visit for dinner occasionally,\" Qin Chu said as he gently brushed Huo Mian's hair.</p><p>\"If time turned back to seven years ago, would you still choose to meet me?\" Huo Mian suddenly asked in sorrow.</p><p>Qin Chu thought for a moment, and replied with conviction, \"If time turns back to seven years ago, then I would apply for a visa a week earlier than I did, and the two of us would go to the States together. That way, we wouldn't miss out on seven years.\"</p><p>For Qin Chu, being away from Huo Mian for those seven years was the biggest regret in his life.</p><p>Huo Mian dug her head into Qin Chu's chest, not knowing what to say…</p><p>She felt sad but also moved…</p><p>\"What about you? If time turned back, would you still want to date me?\" Qin Chu suddenly asked without much confidence.</p><p>He was somewhat worried about Huo Mian's reply…</p><p>If they were to go back, and if she hadn't dated him, then Huo Mian's stepfather wouldn't have died.</p><p>Maybe Huo Mian would still be living in a happy family of four.</p><p>Huo Mian tightened her grip around Qin Chu's waist, and after a moment, she said, \"I've never regretted anything I've done in the past, even if I knew it was doomed to begin with. If time turned back, I would still go along with what I believed in back then. I believe that it's not a coincidence that you showed up in front of me amongst the sea of people. It was fate, our fate.\"</p><p>Qin Chu didn't say anything after he heard what she said; instead, he embraced Huo Mian tightly…</p><p>It was an early fall night, and they held each other ever so tightly as if they were afraid of losing each other.</p><p>Some things might be fine if you never had it, but what is terrifying is losing what you once had.</p><p>Huo Mian suddenly realized that if she was forced to leave Qin Chu one day, she might die of heartbreak…</p><p>She wanted a man like him so badly, and to be able to be by his side her entire life….</p><p>Huo Mian went to work the next day, and several nurses surrounded her with odd smiles.</p><p>\"What's with you guys?

We heard about it already, looks like your news really isn't up to date.\"</p><p>\"Uhm… I really didn't know.\"</p><p>Huo Mian rarely paid attention to the gossip around the hospital. She only focuses on the patients in her area, so it was understandable that her news wasn't up to date.</p><p>\"Be careful though, Tingting - the nurse on the other shift, might be really pissed off. She applied for the promotion several times and never got it. Now that you've been promoted all of a sudden, she will definitely be pissed off at you.\"</p><p>\"Yea, Tingting is different from Nannan. Nannan only wants money and a rich husband, so she never planned to stay around at the hospital. Tingting values power and status, and she had always wanted to seize opportunities to rise up among the ranks, so you should be careful.\"</p><p>Afterward, the few nurses giggled and left…</p><p>The truth was, Huo Mian didn't know them too well; however, their departments were close by, so she would occasionally go over to help.</p><p>Only Tingting, Nannan, and Xiaomei worked at the Orthopaedics Department.</p><p>After Xiaomei was wounded, a nurse from another department was transferred over to take her place. That nurse was called Wang Xiaoyan; she didn't talk a lot and hadn't really interacted with Huo Mian.</p><p>As she was immersed in her thoughts, the head nurse, Song Ling suddenly walked over, \"Huo Mian, come with me.\"</p><p>- Inside the department office -</p><p>\"Huo Mian, you must have heard about your promotion already, the hospital will release an official announcement at noon.\"</p><p>\"Promotion?\" Huo Mian was still somewhat confused.</p><p>\"Yes, you're now the head nurse of the Orthopaedic Department.\"</p><p>\"What about you?\" Huo Mian was surprised.</p><p>Song Ling laughed. \"I've been transferred to the Finance Department to act as their new director.\"</p><p>\"That's great, congratulations!\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Song Ling seemed to be happy as well.</p><p>\"There are two reasons for your promotion. First, the patients you took care of all made the recommendation, which meant that Mr. Liu in room #2 said plenty of good things about you, and even though Mr. Su didn't say much, he did give you an 'A' on your performance report. It seems that he's quite satisfied with you. Your performance has been exceptional over the days you've been here, and I also gave you an 'A'. But most importantly, it was because of Director Wu's recommendation that you were promoted so soon.\"</p><p>\"Director Wu?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Director Wu seems to value you quite highly. After your promotion, you'll be the head nurse of our department, and I trust you to do a good job. Your paycheck will be twelve thousand yuan per month from now on, with lots of other benefits, so… do a good job, okay?\"</p><p>\"Thanks, Head Nurse. Oops, I meant thank you, Director Song,\" Huo Mian smiled as she scratched her head.</p><p>Song Ling should have been transferred away a long time ago, but no one was able to take over her position yet.</p><p>Now that Huo Mian was here, she felt reassured, or else she really wouldn't trust leaving her work to those unreliable girls.</p><p>\"Tingting might be angry, so please be considerate of her feelings,\" reminded Song Ling.</p><p>\"I understand.\"</p><p>\"Very good then, off to work you go. I'm rooting for you.\"</p><p>Huo Mian felt a bit perplexed as she walked out of the office. She hadn't had the chance to see Director Wu after she saved Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>She was surprised about her sudden promotion, but even though it wasn't a great position, it was still rare for a 24-year-old young woman like Huo Mian to become the head nurse at a top-notch hospital.</p><p>At the on-call station, Tingting was speaking with the other nurses. When she saw Huo Mian come her way, she sneered, \"Congratulations on your promotion.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"Things sure are different after taking care of Young Master Su, it must be nice when there's someone looking out for you.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that, Tingting?\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"You don't know what I mean? Why are you still pretending? The entire hospital knows about you and Young Master Su. Huo Mian. You're good, there are so many pretty girls at our hospital, but you're the lucky one that Mr. Su laid his eyes on.\"</p><p>\"So you're now jealous of me?\" Huo Mian asked Wang Tingting as she looked at her.</p><p>\"I'm just confused. since you are already with Young Master Su, why are you still here at South Side? Shouldn't you be living your luxurious life? The head nurse position is such a pity for you, shouldn't you be the young Mrs. Su by now?\"</p><p>The other few nurses giggled after hearing what Wang Tingting said.</p><p>\"But I just like being a head nurse at South Side, I think this position… suits me well,\" Huo Mian stared into Wang Tingting's eyes as she spoke, enunciating every word.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":262,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:49:59.977","Link":"Chapter-262","NameDisplay":"Chapter 262"},{"ID":18112095004109563,"Name":"Chapter 263: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 263: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (5)","Description":"<p>Chapter 263: The So-Called “Love me, Love my Dog” (5)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"You…\" Wang Tingting was obviously furious.</p><p>\"Tingting, humans are all like this.

No strenuous exercises for now.\"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu lifted his head and looked at Huo Mian, \"What do you mean by 'strenuous exercises'? I don't know what that is, can you explain it to me?\"</p><p>Huo Mian read between the lines and felt her face heat up a bit…</p><p>\"What I mean is that you should not run, jump, or drive a racecar. It's dangerous, and if you get hurt again, it'll become more serious.\"</p><p>\"Yeah? What about… physical needs? I'll be fine as long as I don't take too much initiative?\"</p><p>Su Yu jokingly asked…</p><p>\"I'm sorry, this isn't within the scope of my responsibilities.

There were desserts, macarons, and milk tea.</p><p>Did Wu Xiaoxue get up from the wrong side of the bed this morning?</p><p>\"Why are you doing this?\" Distracted, Huo Mian put down the pen in her hand.</p><p>\"I know when to be grateful,\" Wu Xiaoxue answered simply.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately understood what she was talking about. Truth be told, she never thought that Wu Xiaoxue was one that knew how to be grateful.</p><p>Huo Mian thought that Wu Xiaoxue would tell her to mind her own business.</p><p>\"You don't have to, I would've saved anyone,\" Huo Mian said nonchalantly.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, I envy you. If I were you, I definitely wouldn't have helped my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend. Plus, I picked on you so much back then.\"</p><p>\"That's why you're not me.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"My uncle is right, you're an extraordinary woman. I've never admired anyone in my life, but you've truly surprised me. If it weren't for you, my baby wouldn't still be safely in here,\" Wu Xiaoxue said as she stroked her belly.</p><p>\"That's why you need to be careful when driving. You need to remember that you're pregnant.\"</p><p>\"I will. Anyways… thank you. You're Ning Zhiyuan's ex, and I will continue to hate you. But, that's a different matter. You saved me, and I'm not an ungrateful bitch. I owe you one. If you need a favor in the future, I promise I will pay it up.\"</p><p>\"That's not necessary, I wasn't thinking about getting you to pay me back when I was saving you.\"</p><p>\"I hate that you act so high and mighty all the time like you're a savior or something. You have this 'I can save the world, but the world does not have to thank me for it' complex. But still, I finally understand why you're so successful as a human being.\"</p><p>Huo Mian didn't respond, because she was suddenly at a loss for words…</p><p>\"I heard you were promoted.\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"Do a good job. I hope that we can have a surgical competition in the OR one day. Everyone's been saying that your skills are advanced, but I'm not convinced. I'll wait until you become a doctor; meanwhile, I'll be working on my own craft.\"</p><p>Then, before Huo Mian could say anything else, Wu Xiaoxue turned around and left…</p><p>Huo Mian stared at the afternoon tea she brought her with mixed emotions…</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue was indeed a conflicted person; she wouldn't become gentle and grateful all of a sudden.</p><p>However, she could tell right from wrong, and she knew that it was Huo Mian who saved her. That was probably enough.</p><p>She wasn't expecting Wu Xiaoxue to pay retributions to her. After all, she did save Wu Xiaoxue mostly because of Director Wu.</p><p>Plus, she was Ning Zhiyuan's wife. No matter what happened in the past, she couldn't ignore two lives like they were strangers.</p><p>After another night shift, ten luxury cars appeared outside South Side.</p><p>They were all Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porches, and other \"can't afford\" cars.</p><p>There was also a limited-edition Rolls-Royce; apparently, that was Mrs. Su's car.</p><p>Everyone knew that Su Yu was being discharged today.</p><p>The welcoming ceremony was extremely over-the-top. Su Yu was feeling much better; he no longer needed help walking and left his room on his own.</p><p>He walked slowly, hoping that he would be able to see Huo Mian send him off. Maybe she would say something to him.</p><p>However, after looking around, he failed to see Huo Mian anywhere.</p><p>\"Young Master, Miss Huo is at the morning meeting,\" one of his bodyguards reminded him.</p><p>\"You talk too much; do you still want your job?\" Su Yu cursed at him angrily.</p><p>\"Yes.\" The bodyguard immediately shut up.</p><p>\"It's time, everyone's waiting for you at the hotel. Let's go, Yu.\" Mrs. Su smiled gently.</p><p>Reluctant to leave, Su Yu looked back one last time, but Huo Mian wasn't there.</p><p>It wasn't until all the cars left that Huo Mian came downstairs.</p><p>\"Head Nurse, Young Master Su was discharged,\" Nannan said thoughtlessly.</p><p>\"That's a good thing, that bastard's finally gone.\"</p><p>\"Hm… aren't you going to miss him… even a little bit?\" Nannan looked at Huo Mian in disbelief.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":264,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:00.917","Link":"Chapter-264","NameDisplay":"Chapter 264"},{"ID":18112095014347404,"Name":"Chapter 265: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (2)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 265: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (2)","Description":"<p>Chapter 265: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (2)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Why should I be?\" bewildered, Huo Mian asked Nannan.</p><p>\"But everyone's saying that Young Master Su has a thing for you.\"</p><p>\"Those are just words, don't take them seriously. Su Yu has a bucket of girlfriends, and most of them are celebrities. He's just looking for a way out of boredom at our hospital. Don't make a fuss over it.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, you're right. Mr. Su has so many women around him anyways. I don't think we'll have another chance to see him now that he's discharged,\" Nannan said, her expression grim.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled without saying anything else…</p><p>The best move for her was to avoid seeing Su Yu. Although Huo Siqian was not a good person, his warning made sense; she didn't want to be involved with a man like Su Yu.</p><p>Entertainment headlines for that day read: 'Su Yu, the president of Imperial Star, was discharged. Luxury cars welcomed him, and popular celebrities were all there celebrating the great occasion. It was like a movie festival.'</p><p>Apparently, A-tier celebrities including Zhao Qingya, Annie Liang, Li Sisi, Jian Tong, and Wen Yonghui were all there.</p><p>It was like a harem rivalry TV show…</p><p>In the end, Zhao Qingya was the one who sat with Su Yu in his car. Obviously, her status was slightly higher than the rest.</p><p>- Late Night -</p><p>The lights inside Su Yu's private mansion were all on, and the music was blasting on high. Dozens of pretty girls in bikinis danced around the pool.</p><p>A couple of men sat together in armchairs, one next to the other, enjoying the night as well as the beautiful women. The atmosphere was exhilarating.</p><p>However, Su Yu didn't seem to be in the mood to party. He held a glass of red wine in his hand, occasionally taking a sip.</p><p>His other hand scrolled through his phone, while his mind seemed to be elsewhere.</p><p>\"What's wrong? You seem out of it tonight.\" Huo Siqian came up to him with a wine glass. He pulled up a chair and sat down across from Su Yu.</p><p>Su Yu immediately clicked on the home button and then locked his phone.</p><p>\"It's boring, living the same life, day after day,\" Su Yu said casually.</p><p>\"You were at the recuperation center for a while, you must have been bored to death.\"</p><p>\"It was fine,\" Su Yu answered vaguely.</p><p>\"How's my sister? Have you succeeded yet?\" Huo Siqian asked.</p><p>Obviously depressed, Su Yu licked his lips and said, \"I think your sister is a lesbian.\"</p><p>\"Haha, why would you say that?\" Huo Siqian burst into laughter.</p><p>\"I don't think she likes men, and I'm too lazy to bother with her.\"</p><p>\"So what you mean to say is, Mian rejected you?\" Huo Siqian deduced.</p><p>\"I think she rejected me to spark my interest. Aren't all women like that? Playing games of this sort.\"</p><p>\"This just means that you don't know her well enough,\" Huo Siqian laughed again.</p><p>Su Yu immediately rolled his eyes at him. \"You don't know her either. Don't forget, she hasn't been back to your family for years; she even made a public announcement about it.\"</p><p>Huo Siqian's expression changed, and he smiled bitterly. \"Yeah, she's stubborn like that, and no one can do anything about it.\"</p><p>\"But don't worry, any obstacles are only temporary. No woman that I like can escape from me, it's just a matter of time.\"</p><p>Su Yu seemed confident; he was rich, good-looking, and powerful, and he basically had everything any woman would want in the world.</p><p>He was sure that Huo Mian would one day fall for him…</p><p>After hearing what Su Yu said, Huo Siqian immediately stopped laughing and said, \"I suggest that you give up on her.\"</p><p>\"Why? You don't think I can take care of it?\"</p><p>Huo Siqian shook his head, \"That's not it. Mian… isn't a woman you can touch.\"</p><p>\"F*ck, what the hell do you mean by that? What do you mean I can't touch her? There isn't a woman in C City I can't touch.\"</p><p>Su Yu became immediately angered by what he said…</p><p>\"I'm not looking down on you. There's someone Mian likes, and she'll never accept you.\"</p><p>\"I know, she told me that she has a boyfriend, but so what? People who get married can still divorce. Even if she has a daughter, I can still do it. I'm not willing to give up.\"</p><p>Then, Su Yu picked up his glass and drank every sip of his wine…</p><p>Huo Siqian looked at him meaningfully, \"You don't know who she likes, do you?\"</p><p>\"Is that important?\" Su Yu broke into laughter.</p><p>\"Of course it is. Once you find out, you'll understand what I was talking about today.\"</p><p>\"Why are you being so cryptic? Don't tell me that it's you.\" Su Yu looked at Huo Siqian profoundly.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":265,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:01.437","Link":"Chapter-265","NameDisplay":"Chapter 265"},{"ID":181120950219611,"Name":"Chapter 266: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 266: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (3)","Description":"<p>Chapter 266: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (3)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Of course not, Mian is my little sister.\"</p><p>\"It's not like she's related to you by blood.\" Su Yu went straight to the point. Huo Siqian's expression changed, but just for a second.</p><p>\"You're thinking too much, Young Master Su. Mian isn't my type.\"</p><p>\"Right, you have always liked 36D or bigger.\"</p><p>\"Haha, you know me well.\"</p><p>Then, Huo Siqian and Su Yu proceeded with small talk; neither of them brought up Huo Mian's name again.</p><p>However, they also discovered something about each other.</p><p>Huo Siqian realized that Su Yu was genuinely interested in Huo Mian.</p><p>When he was walking up to him, he peaked at Su Yu's phone and noticed that he was looking at a photo of Huo Mian.</p><p>Although Su Yu quickly pressed the home button, Huo Siqian still saw it.</p><p>Su Yu, on the other hand, discovered that Huo Siqian's expression became weird whenever Huo Mian's name was mentioned.</p><p>Although he had been trying extremely hard to cover up his feelings.</p><p>Su Yu wasn't just another stupid man with a lot of money, he was part of the military for several years.</p><p>As an elite in the special forces, his brain and physique were all top notch.</p><p>His sharp instincts told him that Huo Siqian didn't just treat Huo Mian like a sister.</p><p>He felt something towards her that was inappropriate to feel towards a sister…</p><p>Huo Mian kept her promotion on the down-low; aside from the people that already knew from the hospital, she only mentioned it to Qin Chu.</p><p>However, although she wanted to keep it low-key, Qin Chu immediately reserved a table at Seven Aromas Hot Pot.</p><p>Seven Aromas was known for its spicy-broth hot pots. The broth was delicious, so they were very popular.</p><p>Plus, this was a high-end, expensive restaurant, where even the beef was supplied by free-range cattle ranches.</p><p>Over there, hot pot cost more than ten thousand yuan a meal…</p><p>Not only did Qin Chu reserve a table at the hot pot restaurant, he also decided to invite Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling on behalf of Huo Mian.</p><p>Therefore, when the four of them met up for dinner, the atmosphere changed again.</p><p>\"Oh wow, new car? Seems like you're dating someone new.\"</p><p>\"What does that have to do with you?\" Zhu Lingling glared at Gao Ran.</p><p>\"I was just wondering how blind the guy must have been to agree to date someone like you.\"</p><p>\"There are lots of blind guys in this world. Either way, at least I'm better than you, Mr. Forever-Alone. You're gonna be alone for the rest of your life, that's too bad.\"</p><p>\"Who says I'm single? Let me tell you, I have quite a few admirers. There are buckets after buckets of policewomen at our bureau who are all into me. It's not like you'd understand.\"</p><p>\"Buckets after buckets? Are you sure you're talking about women and not potatoes?\" Zhu Lingling snapped back.</p><p>Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling were like mortal enemies from birth; they wreaked havoc onto each other every time they met.</p><p>Huo Mian watched and laughed as they fought…</p><p>Qin Chu, on the other hand, quietly put beef onto Huo Mian's plate…</p><p>\"Come on, can you guys not be so cheesy? Are you trying to kill us single people out here?\" Gao Ran wailed unhappily.</p><p>\"Hey, not us, just you. I'm not single,\" Zhu Lingling emphasized.</p><p>\"Soon you will be.\"</p><p>\"Phft, I can't believe you cursed me. If we really break up, I swear I'm going to…\"</p><p>\"If you break up, you should date Gao Ran. You guys will be great together,\" Huo Mian suggested while eating hot pot.</p><p>\"Don't, ma'am, don't do that to me. My eyesight is fine, I'm not blind yet.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry, it's just a matter of time,\" Huo Mian laughed.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, get your wife in order, she's openly cursing the people's police.\"</p><p>Gao Ran sent help signals at Qin Chu…</p><p>\"My wife has a point.\"</p><p>\"Seriously… you're basically controlled by your wife. It's too late to save you.\"</p><p>\"That's why a single person like you would never understand what it feels like to be in love.\" Zhu Lingling laughed.</p><p>\"You guys eat, bye.\" Then, Gao Ran got up and pretended to leave.</p><p>\"Remember to pick up the bill on your way out,\" Qin Chu said slowly.</p><p>\"Sh*t, where's your humanity, President of GK? I can't believe that you would make a little cop like me pay for the bill. Where did you get the audacity?\"</p><p>\"Not all cops have the ability to drive Jaguars. Therefore… you're a capable cop.\" Huo Mian burst into laughter.</p><p>\"Hey, you ungrateful woman, I even asked for time off to come to celebrate your promotion. This is how the two of you treat me? The friendship boat sure sinks fast.\"</p><p>Gao Ran's remarks sent Zhu Lingling and Huo Mian into a hysterical laughter.</p><p>\"Don't sink the boat, it's my treat today.\" Huo Mian immediately raised her hand, signaling that she would be the one paying.</p><p>\"Hey, Mian, I saw on the news that Su Yu was discharged today?\" Zhu Lingling suddenly asked, hoping for some gossip.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":266,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:02.02","Link":"Chapter-266","NameDisplay":"Chapter 266"},{"ID":18112095025723053,"Name":"Chapter 267: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 267: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (4)","Description":"<p>Chapter 267: She's Not Some Woman You Can Touch (4)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian nodded, \"Yeah, he was discharged.\"</p><p>\"I saw the formation outside the hospital, so many female celebrities went.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, there were a few that I didn't even recognize. A lot of people were watching, and a lot of the media attended.\"</p><p>\"I saw from one of the smaller news outlets that while Su Yu was staying at South Side, he was really flirty with one of the nurses there. Do you know who she is? Come on, tell us what happened?\"</p><p>\"What's so fun about entertainment news? At most, it's a rich boy trying to get in bed with someone. It's boring,\" Gao Ran took a big bite of beef and interjected.</p><p>\"Guys won't understand topics like this.\" Zhu Lingling immediately grabbed Huo Mian's hand and asked, \"Come on, tell me about it.\"</p><p>A little guilty, Huo Mian glanced at Qin Chu, and then she answered, \"Actually…I'm not sure either. Su Yu always has bodyguards around and is hard to get close to, so his private life is kept pretty discreet.\"</p><p>\"Oh, you have a point. Even if someone like Su Yu screws himself into a scandal, the media won't be able to report about it.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling mumbled to herself, finally putting an end to this topic…</p><p>While they were eating, Zhu Lingling took a photo of them on her phone; Huo Mian, Qin Chu, and Gao Ran were all in it.</p><p>Then, she uploaded the photo to their class group…</p><p>The group immediately exploded…</p><p>\"Zhu Lingling, did you take that photo? Is it real?\"</p><p>\"Is that Huo Mian beside Qin Chu?\"</p><p>\"Where are you guys eating? The hot pot looks good.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling rolled her eyes and cursed, \"Idiots, that's not the point.\"</p><p>Soon after, Liu Siying signed on as well. She asked, \"Is this Seven Aromas?\"</p><p>She definitely knew her stuff – she could tell it was Seven Aromas just by looking at the pot in the middle of the table. Liu Siying was indeed impressive.</p><p>\"Yeah, why? Do you want to come?\" Zhu Lingling provoked.</p><p>\"You think I don't have the guts to?\" Liu Siying replied.</p><p>\"I'll be here waiting, if you don't come in 15 minutes, I'll assume that you've chickened out.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling always wanted to throw a wet blanket over Liu Siying's arrogance…</p><p>She never had the chance to do it in the past. Now that this opportunity appeared before her, how was she going to pass that up?</p><p>Huo Mian and Qin Chu had already exited the group chat, so they didn't know what was going on.</p><p>After ten or so minutes, Liu Siying barged through the door, leaving Huo Mian dumbfounded.</p><p>\"Not bad, you're punctual,\" Zhu Lingling said as she looked at Liu Siying.</p><p>Liu Siying didn't say anything. She glanced at Qin Chu, then walked up to the table and sat down on an empty seat.</p><p>\"Um… who is this…?\" Bewildered, Gao Ran looked at the woman who suddenly entered the scene.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't say anything either; she was a bit dumbfounded as well.</p><p>Qin Chu's face, on the other hand, was expressionless…</p><p>\"She's a high school classmate, I invited her to come, but I didn't think she actually would,\" Zhu Lingling explained.</p><p>\"Qin Chu, have you been busy?\" Liu Siying looked around before her gaze finally stopped on Qin Chu's handsome face.</p><p>Qin Chu, who did not plan to reply, carefully put a shrimp ball in Huo Mian's bowl.</p><p>Proud of herself, Zhu Lingling laughed, \"We're here to celebrate Huo Mian's promotion.\"</p><p>\"Oh really? Congratulations on the promotion,\" Liu Siying looked at Huo Mian and said unwillingly.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"Qin Chu, my dad said that our companies are partnering up, and that Uncle Qin was the one who personally proposed the partnership. It's a good project. My dad said that you're really good at your job, and GK's doing even better than it used to.\"</p><p>Qin Chu gracefully wiped the corner of his mouth with a napkin. Then, he said, \"I didn't hear about a partnership with your dad's company. If my dad was the one who made the decision, that is just his decision. There's no guarantee that the board will approve it.\"</p><p>Liu Siying's expression darkened upon hearing what he said…</p><p>Qin Chu was still unwilling to help her save some face…</p><p>\"Chu, what's going on?

Goodnight.\"</p><p>After her WeChat conversation with Lingling, Huo Mian saw that Qin Chu was watching TV on the couch.</p><p>His face was so emotionless that she wasn't sure if he was angry or not.</p><p>Lingling really took it too far tonight…</p><p>Therefore, she shuffled over and sat down beside Qin Chu.</p><p>\"Do you want some fruit?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Are you thirsty?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"Do you want some midnight snacks?\"</p><p>\"Mian, we just had dinner…\" Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian hopelessly.</p><p>\"Are you mad?\"</p><p>\"Why would I be mad?\"</p><p>\"Because Lingling invited Liu…\"</p><p>\"What does that have to do with me?\" Qin Chu asked nonchalantly.</p><p>\"Um… what about Liu Siying's confession? Got any thoughts on that?\" Huo Mian probed.</p><p>That was what she really wanted to know…</p><p>Another woman confessing her love to her husband right in front of her made Huo Mian a little uncomfortable.</p><p>\"What thoughts do you want me to have?\" Qin Chu smiled as he looked at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"How would I know what you think?\"</p><p>\"Oh, Liu Siying is nice, she's pretty.\"</p><p>\"Really? I don't think she's that good looking.\" Huo Mian was unwilling to back down.</p><p>\"I think she is.\"</p><p>\"Really?

If so, you should marry her instead, it's a shame that you're stuck with me.\"</p><p>Then, Huo Mian angrily turned around to leave…</p><p>Qin Chu immediately grabbed her and hugged her tightly from the back…</p><p>\"Let go of me.\"</p><p>\"You're angry?\" Qin Chu laughed when he saw Huo Mian's face red with fury.</p><p>\"Of course not.

Aside from that one drunken incident seven years ago, she never even had any hands-on experience. Therefore, when Qin Chu provocatively teased her, her entire body tensed up out of nervousness.</p><p>Qin Chu hugged Huo Mian from behind, and his hands moved up and down her body. He first breathed at her neck and then kissed her with his cold lips. He was incredibly patient…</p><p>Yet, Huo Mian felt like she was in danger…</p><p>Finally, Huo Mian couldn't take it anymore. She turned around. \"Honey…\"</p><p>However, Qin Chu immediately covered her mouth with his own and French-kissed kissed her deeply but tenderly…</p><p>Huo Mian's entire world began to spin around, and her brain was about to shut down…</p><p>Although she kept telling herself to stay rational and not give in like this… her body instinctively told her that she couldn't take it any longer and was about to burst…</p><p>Under the bright lights, Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian's face, which was red from shyness, her eyes closed because she was nervous, and her slightly curly eyelashes… All that was left on his face was endless tenderness…</p><p>He was a person that always appeared ice cold, yet he could be so gentle to Huo Mian.</p><p>He was arrogant but sweet to Huo Mian.</p><p>He was heartless but lovesick for Huo Mian.</p><p>He was quiet but always had so much to talk about with Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, kept her eyes tightly shut…</p><p>Then, she felt the warmth of a big palm caressing her collarbone, slowly moving southwards…</p><p>She was so nervous that her face turned crimson…</p><p>Yet, she did not have the courage to push Qin Chu away…</p><p>Only because this man was the only man that she had ever loved so deeply.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Chu's movements stopped, and everything went quiet…</p><p>The air calmed down, and curious, Huo Mian opened her eyes.</p><p>She saw Qin Chu looking at her, unmoving, like a rock…</p><p>\"You…\" She opened her mouth, not sure what to say.</p><p>\"You had your eyes closed. Were you waiting for me to do something?\" The corners of Qin Chu's mouth raised into a smile.</p><p>Almost immediately, Huo Mian came back to her senses. She tightened her grasp around her shirt collar and, with a long face, she said, \"Of course not, are you kidding me?\"</p><p>\"Your face is really red, what were you thinking about just now?\" Qin Chu purposely asked her.</p><p>\"I was thinking of how spicy that hot pot we just had was.\"</p><p>\"Why is your face red?\" Qin Chu was unwilling to let go.</p><p>\"Because it was too spicy, okay?\" Huo Mian was looking for any excuse.</p><p>Qin Chu wanted to laugh…</p><p>This was his first time teasing this girl like that.

It was his revenge for her continued rejection.</p><p>Upon seeing Huo Mian's shy expression and awkward response, he felt exhilarated.</p><p>After Huo Mian readjusted her clothes, she sat back onto the couch and turned on the TV to watch Bonnie Bears.</p><p>She was pretending as nothing happened…</p><p>\"Were you… expecting something just now?\"</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>\"But you look disappointed, were your urges not satisfied?\"</p><p>\"Qin Chu, you as* face, do you not want to sleep on my bed tonight?\"</p><p>\"Honey, I apologize… should we continue with what we were doing just now…\" Qin Chu held out his hand to hug Huo Mian's shoulders.</p><p>But she immediately avoided him…</p><p>\"Hey, Honey, don't be angry.

I heard that even Zhao Qingya stopped looking for him.\"</p><p>\"Oh really? I see.\" Naturally, Huo Yanyan knew about Su Yu's relationship with Zhao Qingya, but she didn't care.</p><p>\"Why? Don't tell me that you're trying to get into Su Yu's bed. I'd advise against it.\"</p><p>\"Why? He's so successful and good-looking, so isn't it normal for me to like him?\" Huo Yanyan smiled.</p><p>Xiaoyou shook her head, \"Young Master Su has a bad temper, women like us can't handle men like him. I suggest you find another target, Young Master Tang isn't too bad; he's rich and is a really nice guy. You can give him a shot.\"</p><p>\"Are you talking about Tang Chuan? He's not my type, I can't stand guys who wear eyeliner and pretend to be a K-pop star.\" Huo Yanyan looked at a young man not far from them in disdain.</p><p>\"Don't say that I didn't warn you, good luck.\" Xiaoyou wasn't actually close with Huo Yanyan, as they met each other through another friend. Huo Yanyan bought her a bag, so she decided to introduce her into Su Yu's circle.</p><p>The truth was, Huo Siqian and Su Yu were buddies, but there was no way Huo Yanyan was going to ask Huo Siqian for help.</p><p>The whole world knew about the Huo family's civil war…</p><p>As for Xiaoyou, she was a woman in this circle and knew too well how things went around here. It was just a circle based on exchanges.</p><p>She already warned her. As for the rest, well, that was up to Huo Yanyan herself.</p><p>Then, Xiaoyou picked up her wine glass and went up to a rich heir to play dice with him.</p><p>Huo Yanyan gritted her teeth and headed towards Su Yu with a wine glass in her hand…</p><p>She especially wore a new-arrival Gucci dress. It was navy blue with blue princess hems, with a blue and red silk ribbon at the collar. It was an elegant and beautiful dress, but definitely not Huo Yanyan's usual style.</p><p>However, she heard from others that Su Yu was into fresh-looking girls recently, so she pretended that was her style.</p><p>Who knows? Maybe he would fall for her.</p><p>\"Young Master Su, hi, my name is Huo Yanyan. Nice to meet you.\"</p><p>Huo Yanyan had a sweet smile, her hair fell to her waist, and her body had great proportions.</p><p>She thought that even if Su Yu didn't fall in love with her instantly, she would at least leave a good impression on him.</p><p>After Su Yu heard what she said, he slowly opened his eyes and lazily glanced at the woman in front of him.</p><p>\"Huo… what?\" In his daze, he only heard her say 'Huo'. He didn't actually care what her name was, the only thing that interested him was her last name.

However, she still chose to drink from his glass because she was hoping if she did the exact opposite of what everyone does, it might spark Su Yu's interest in her.</p><p>Just like how Zhao Qingya stopped Su Yu's car in the middle of the night and almost died.</p><p>After seeing that Huo Yanyan drank all his wine, Su Yu picked up the empty glass.</p><p>He slowly stood up…</p><p>Everyone watched as they held their breath…</p><p>Huo Yanyan thought that Su Yu was finally going to say something to her.</p><p>However, with a crash, the glass shattered on the ground, frightening everyone around them.</p><p>\"Young Master Su…\" Everyone stood up.</p><p>\"Seriously… so dirty.\" Su Yu looked at the wineglass; was he talking about the wineglass or Huo Yanyan?</p><p>\"Young Master Su, I'm sorry, I didn't know…\" Huo Yanyan pretended to be innocent.</p><p>Before she could finish, Su Yu looked at her and said, \"Out of everyone in the Huo family, you managed to get the worst genes.\"</p><p>Then, Su Yu turned on his heels and left. The rich heirs also stood up to leave…</p><p>They left Huo Yanyan standing where she was, dumbfounded…</p><p>After Su Yu left the nightclub, he immediately got into his black Sesto Elemento Lamborghini.</p><p>Then, he drove away without looking back…</p><p>As he travelled in the night, his mood became worse.</p><p>Huo Yanyan was an idiot, but she could righteously live in the Huo family. Huo Mian, on the other hand, was an outstanding woman, but she was not allowed to go back.</p><p>Was that old man Huo blind?</p><p>At this thought, he became even more agitated, and the car came to a sudden stop under a tree by the side of the road.</p><p>He whipped out his phone and made a phone call, \"Starting tomorrow, we will no longer engage in any business partnerships with the Huo Corporation.\"</p><p>The next morning, Huo Siqian received news that the Su Family was going to withdraw their funds and never cooperate with them again.</p><p>He immediately called Su Yu…</p><p>\"Young Master Su, did I do something wrong?

The first one's name is Cheng Xiaomei, but it sounds way too old fashioned, so I've already changed her stage name to Cheng Xiruo. The second is Wang Shuang. She has an innocent look and would be better suited to act in high school dramas, with the potential to become the new idol for younger male audiences. The third is very pretty and well behaved, but she doesn't have many distinguishing features and looks like all the beautiful girls that are internet-famous. I think that she might have gotten work done on her face.

Her smile was a little stiff, and it affected how she looked up close.</p><p>\"President Su, I would like to toast this glass of wine to you. Thanks for giving me this opportunity.\"</p><p>However, Su Yu replied coldly, \"That's not necessary.\"</p><p>Then, he turned around and no longer spoke with that girl named Mian Mian.</p><p>For the whole night, he never said another word to her.</p><p>Mian Mian was sad, so when she went to the bathroom, she secretly asked Lisa.</p><p>\"Sister Lisa, didn't President Su specifically name me to be the supporting actress? Why doesn't he seem to like me?\" Mian Mian thought that Su Yu picked her for her looks and wanted to take her back home tonight. She wouldn't mind if he wanted her to sleep with him.</p><p>She knew that if she slept with Su Yu, then her whole life would be set.</p><p>Each and every woman Su Yu slept with in the past had all ended up with bright futures…</p><p>\"I don't know either,\" Lisa also didn't know why Su Yu picked Mian Mian.</p><p>She thought that President Su would pick the young and cheerful Wang Shuang because at least that girl had a completely natural look.</p><p>However, who knew that President Su's taste would be so vulgar? She would've never imagined that this girl would luck out, only because she had a 'Mian' word in her name.</p><p>As people began to leave that night, Mian Mian refused to give up, so she came up to Su Yu.</p><p>\"President Su, let me help you up.\" Her voice sounded all soft and fluffy.</p><p>\"Go away, don't touch me,\" He forcefully waved his arm, nearly causing Mian Mian to fall onto the ground.</p><p>Su Yu's bad temper was well known amongst the others; he had never treated women nicely and were often harsh with them.</p><p>Of course, he never brutally beat any of them, but he did treat women with a rough attitude.</p><p>However, there was only one exception…</p><p>\"Seems like President Su doesn't plan on sleeping with you. You are overthinking, go home, and work hard to do well on the show,\" Lisa reminded Mian Mian after she realized what was going on.</p><p>\"Yes, Sister Lisa.\" Mian Mian walked away in her off-shoulder cocktail dress, with tears in her eyes.</p><p>Su Yu got into his black Lamborghini with a cold expression on his face…</p><p>\"President Su, should I get a driver to take you home?\" Lisa asked with concern.</p><p>\"No.\" After he spoke, he stepped on the gas pedal and sped off.</p><p>- Inside his private mansion -</p><p>He still didn't feel like sleeping yet, so he took a Lafite from the shelves and drank it alone.</p><p>His phone was placed on the coffee table, and, with just one look at the screen, one could see a beautiful girl in a white nurse uniform and black-rimmed glasses, with an adorable and innocent look on her face.</p><p>After a glass of wine, Su Yu grew even more depressed…</p><p>He reached out his finger to gently touch the photo on his phone, and mockingly said to himself, \"What's with me? Why do I want to see you so bad?\"</p><p>He didn't have Huo Mian's WeChat, but he did have her phone number. However, he didn't want to call her, because he knew that Huo Mian had a boyfriend.</p><p>If he called this late, then it might start a fight between the couple.</p><p>Even though Su Yu wanted to compete with her boyfriend, he also wanted to win her fair and square, so he didn't want to use such a despicable method to ruin things with her.</p><p>He grew more and more perplexed, so he called his good friend, Wei Liao.</p><p>Wei Liao was already half asleep, so when he received the call, he looked at the time and cursed, \"Piece of sh*t Su, do you know what time it is? Why the f*ck aren't you sleeping?\"</p><p>\"I can't sleep.\"</p><p>\"Then find a girl to sleep with,\" Wei Liao said nonchalantly.</p><p>\"Sleep your a*s, I'll give you ten minutes to get to my place.\"</p><p>\"I'm not interested in men.\" Wei Liao laughed.</p><p>\"Don't worry, I don't like pansy little boys like you.\"</p><p>Wei Liao hung up and immediately drove to Su Yu's mansion, arriving in no later than eight minutes.</p><p>Of course, all Su Yu wanted was to drink with him.</p><p>\"You don't seem to be in a good mood,\" Wei Liao laughed teasingly with one hand in his pocket.</p><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"You've been like this recently, who is this girl that managed to get you to fall for her? I really want to meet her now,\" Wei Liao predicted Su Yu's current situation. Su Yu had never been short with money, and Wei Liao hadn't heard of anything bad that happened to his family recently. The only reason he might be troubled would be that he met a girl that he couldn't get. Su Yu had mentioned this in their Wechat group once.</p><p>At this, Su Yu sighed and became more depressed, and he chugged another glass of wine.</p><p>Wei Liao laughed and walked over. He held up Su Yu's empty glass and looked at it, \"Su, this isn't your style.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":274,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:06.23","Link":"Chapter-274","NameDisplay":"Chapter 274"},{"ID":18112095067755813,"Name":"Chapter 275: Young Master Su Is Not In the Mood (2)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 275: Young Master Su Is Not In the Mood (2)","Description":"<p>Chapter 275: Young Master Su Is Not In the Mood (2)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"What's my style?\" Su Yu raised his head.</p><p>\"You're determined and always get what you want. I've known you for more than twenty years, and you've never chased after a girl for any more than an hour because none of them can contain themselves in front of you.\"</p><p>Wei Liao was right. Once, one of the female celebrities wanted to play hard to get, so when Su Yu laid his eyes on her, she kindly rejected him.</p><p>As a result, Su Yu slept with a younger trainee in that celebrity's company that night. On the second day, that girl became the lead actress on a major film, subsequently becoming a big star.</p><p>Once the little celebrity began to regret things, she came looking for Su Yu, but Su Yu had already forgotten who she was.</p><p>Later, everyone in the circle found out that Su Yu didn't like to be rejected. If he took an interest in you, then you'd better hurry over to him and start taking off your clothes.</p><p>The truth was, if you played hard to get, then you'll lose that opportunity, and perhaps never get to see Su Yu ever again.</p><p>\"She's different from the others,\" Su Yu said in all seriousness.</p><p>\"Different how? Women are the same, just throw money at them.\"</p><p>\"If it were really that easy, then what do I need you for?\" Su Yu was pissed.</p><p>\"Right, with your intelligence, you could get a girl in a matter of seconds, but if someone like you failed, it could only mean three things,\" Wei Liao analyzed.</p><p>Su Yu froze, \"What three things?\"</p><p>Wei Liao raised his index finger, \"First, she doesn't love you. She's probably into someone else, so she doesn't care about you.\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Su Yu nodded and admitted that.</p><p>Wei Liao continued and raises his middle finger, \"Second, it proves that she's not into the money, because if she dated you she would have all the money in the world, but she didn't, which proves that she's not interested in your status and power.\"</p><p>\"That's absolutely right,\" Su Yu gave Wei Liao a thumbs up; his analysis was absolutely correct.</p><p>\"Third, it proves that she's got quite an attitude, or we could say that she's pretty bold. There's that saying on the Internet: 'You might think you're a big shot, but I don't.' I think the girl you like is probably one of those rare badasses.\"</p><p>Su Yu got up in a 'swoosh' and patted Wei Liao's shoulder, \"I think you're pretty badass too, holy crap you are smarter than before.\"</p><p>\"So it seems like I'm right.\" Wei Liao smiled confidently.</p><p>\"You are exactly right, that's what it is. So, what do you think I should do to get her?\"</p><p>\"R*pe her.\"</p><p>\"Get lost.\" Su Yu lost his patience when he saw how off the grid Wei Liao was.</p><p>\"Really, I'm not joking. I think that if you like her, just sleep with her, even if it's r*pe. You'll end up in jail at most, but if you're scared of ending up in jail for her, then you're not qualified to say that you love her. If you end up in jail, then wait until you get out, and keep r*ping her after you get out, then go back to jail, and r*pe when you get out. You'll just have to r*pe her until she questions her life.\" (TL: Noodletown does not condone this type of behavior, so don't listen to this as*face's advice. He might be smart, but he's retarded)</p><p>\"What are you? Some crazy lunatic with all your bullshit?\" Su Yu's face completely darkened...</p><p>Originally, he called him over to help him come up with ideas, but what sort of idea is that? It was absolutely insane.</p><p>On the other side, after the press release ended, Qin Chu immediately rushed home. After dinner, both he and Huo Mian were bored.</p><p>Huo Mian suggested that they see a movie; she said that there was a new Hollywood movie called \"Fantastical Forest\", which claimed to have great 3D scenes.</p><p>Qin Chu was a wife-spoiler, so he naturally went along with whatever she said.</p><p>Finally, the two drove to the nearby Wanda Square. It was the weekend, so there were a lot of people.</p><p>Qin Chu went to get the tickets, along with popcorn and cola, which made Huo Mian very happy.</p><p>She never thought that Qin Chu would be this considerate. Little did she know that Qin Chu knew how to get the tickets because he went with Assistant Yang and his wife last time.</p><p>However, Huo Mian was shocked when he handed her the bucket of tickets…</p><p>\"Uhm… you bought all the seats in the auditorium?\"</p><p>\"Yes, it'll be like a VIP room, with just the two of us,\" Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>\"Wouldn't that be scary?\" Huo Mian was scared of watching movies with hardly anyone around, as she would feel a bit insecure.</p><p>\"It'll be fine, I'll be there.\"</p><p>\"But that's exactly why I'm scared. What if you use the opportunity to do things to me?\" Huo Mian spoke in all seriousness.</p><p>Qin Chu, \"…\"</p><p>\"Hahaha, just kidding, did you really believe what I said?\" Huo Mian laughed very hard when she saw how confused Qin Chu was.</p><p>Just as the two laughed and chatted with each other, a familiar voice suddenly shouted, \"Sis…?\"</p><p>Huo Mian turned around, and her expression changed dramatically…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":275,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:06.777","Link":"Chapter-275","NameDisplay":"Chapter 275"},{"ID":18112095073248255,"Name":"Chapter 276: Young Master Su Is Not In the Mood (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 276: Young Master Su Is Not In the Mood (3)","Description":"<p>Chapter 276: Young Master Su Is Not In the Mood (3)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian and Qin Chu never imagined that they would see Jing Zhixin here…</p><p>Jing Zhixin came with a female classmate who seemed a bit shy. She was wearing glasses and wasn't very pretty.</p><p>\"Uhm… Zhixin, why are you here?\" asked Huo Mian.</p><p>\"I came to watch a movie with my classmate, we got it through Groupon.\"</p><p>\"Oh…\" Huo Mian felt a bit awkward.</p><p>\"Sis, this is my classmate, Zheng Yanru,\" Jing Zhixin introduced.</p><p>Then he said, \"This is my older sister, Huo Mian.\"</p><p>Then, Jing Zhixin looked at Qin Chu and said, \"This is my sister's boyfriend.\"</p><p>\"Hello, sister, and brother-in-law,\" Zheng Yanru greeted them shyly.</p><p>Qin Chu nodded slightly in response...</p><p>Huo Mian felt very uncomfortable… If she knew that they would be found out, and then she would've confessed to Zhixin earlier.</p><p>\"Oh, hi.\"</p><p>\"Sis, what are you guys watching?\" Zhixin didn't seem to mind seeing his sister and Qin Chu together.</p><p>\"Fantastical Forest.\"</p><p>\"We're watching that too, why don't we go together?\" Jing Zhixin was excited.</p><p>\"Let's not, you guys can go first.\" Huo Mian refused politely.</p><p>To her surprise, Qin Chu said, \"Then let's go together? There're lots of empty seats in the VIP room anyways.\"</p><p>\"Really? That's great, we really hit the jackpot with you guys on the VIP,\" smiled Jing Zhixin.</p><p>In the end, the four of them walked into the movie theatre together...</p><p>They each sat on the plush sofas. The girl was very conservative; she would occasionally pull on Jing Zhixin's sleeve and whisper into his ear.</p><p>Qin Chu, on the other hand, reached to wrap his hand around Huo Mian's waist. Even though he wanted to be more intimate with her, it was inconvenient for him to do so with this little brother-in-law around.</p><p>The four watched the movie awkwardly and then finally walked out together.</p><p>\"Sis, are you hungry? Why don't we get something to eat?\"</p><p>\"No, it's fine\" Huo Mian immediately refused. Legit, this could not get more awkward.</p><p>She didn't tell Zhixin that she was with Qin Chu, and Zhixin didn't tell her that he was dating. What a scene...</p><p>\"It's late, we should go now, maybe some other time.\" Qin Chu was quite polite.</p><p>\"Okay, Big Brother Qin Chu, then we'll head back now, you guys should drive safely.\"</p><p>Jing Zhixin happily said goodbye to Qin Chu and Huo Mian, but before he left, he didn't forget to tell his sister, \"Be good to Big Brother Qin Chu, don't be too mean!\"</p><p>\"Mind your own business, you little brat.\" Huo Mian knocked on Zhixin's head.</p><p>The truth was, Zhixin didn't say this for no reason. When Huo Mian was dating Qin Chu, she was only seventeen, and Jing Zhixin was only twelve. But, that didn't stop him from witnessing how his sister brutally treated this future brother-in-law of his.</p><p>On the way back, Huo Mian seemed somewhat distracted.</p><p>\"What's up? Are you scared that Zhixin will tell your mom?\" Qin Chu drove with one hand, while his other hand tightly held onto Huo Mian's hand.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"No, I'm worried about Zhixin.\"</p><p>\"You're worried that the girl only approached him because I gave him that sports car?\" Qin Chu's words clearly spoke of Huo Mian's mind.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately nodded…</p><p>\"Don't worry, he's old enough to deal with things his own way.\"</p><p>\"Zhixin is too innocent, I'm only worried that he'll get hurt.\"</p><p>\"You can't take care of him forever, he'll have to grow up himself eventually.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded, and then she laid her tired head on Qin Chu's leg…</p><p>\"I… won't be able to control myself if you do that.\"</p><p>\"What are you thinking? Drive your car.\" Huo Mian sneakily pinched Qin Chu's leg in fury.</p><p>\"Didn't Zhixin just tell you to be nicer to me?\"</p><p>\"Then, do you want to marry Zhixin instead?\" Huo Mian rolled her eyes.</p><p>Qin Chu twisted his mouth into a smile and couldn't help but laugh. He no longer dared to piss off his lady…</p><p>She felt so relaxed on Qin Chu's leg that she fell asleep…</p><p>When Huo Mian woke up, she noticed that they were still inside the car, and an hour had already passed.</p><p>\"Are you crazy?

I want time to move slower so we could enjoy this moment. One day, when I'm old, I won't be able to give you a piggyback anymore. So, let me do so a few more times while I'm still young, and we'll have some beautiful memories to think back on in the future.\"</p><p>After he spoke, before Huo Mian could respond, Qin Chu arrived at the first set of stairs.</p><p>Huo Mian's eyes felt a bit warm…</p><p>She thought that Qin Chu was stupid for going up the stairs with elevators around.</p><p>Plus, it was the sixteenth floor, wouldn't he be exhausted?</p><p>On the eighth floor, Qin Chu's steps slowed down…</p><p>\"Honey, I can walk now.\" </p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>Just like that, Qin Chu was covered in sweat when he and Huo Mian arrived at the door to their home...</p><p>His black shirt was drenched in sweat…</p><p>Along this way, Huo Mian felt his adoration, something that only belonged to her, as she leaned on Qin Chu's back.</p><p>She believed that no one else in this world would treat her as well as Qin Chu did.</p><p>No one would love and adore her like Qin Chu does.</p><p>Plus, she would never willingly let another man give her a piggyback.</p><p>They were a unique presence in each other's lives, and no one could replace one or the other.</p><p>When she dated Ning Zhiyuan, she always felt like things have passed, and her heart was as calm as a dead sea.</p><p>She thought her life would be filled with mundane things. However, to her surprise, Qin Chu came back.</p><p>Her heart was again filled with adolescent love…</p><p>They spent each passing day together, and no matter how irrational she was, and what she did wrong, Qin Chu never raised his voice in front of her.</p><p>To have a husband like this was everything she could ever ask for…</p><p>Huo Mian thought that she was lucky to have met Qin Chu, and she regretted nothing in this life.</p><p>The moment she got off from Qin Chu's back, Huo Mian held his face in her hands, and lightly kissed the tip of his nose.</p><p>She said, \"Honey, right now, you're the most handsome man in the whole world.\"</p><p>Qin Chu's eyes suddenly filled with endless gentleness…</p><p>Huo Mian's words filled him with happiness the entire night… That was the magic of love.</p><p>Qin Chu hadn't even taken the time to shower as he pressed Huo Mian onto the soft rug, and pressed his lips against hers.</p><p>His right hand swam up and down her body in impatient movements…</p><p>Huo Mian closed both her eyes and her heart filled with nervousness and happiness…</p><p>She wanted to give herself to Qin Chu at an appropriate moment.

What's up?\"</p><p>\"Nothing, I just wanted to tell you to not worry. I won't tell mom. Even if you didn't tell me, I would've guessed. After you broke up with Ning Zhiyuan, he called me twice.

I didn't mean to hide it from you.\"</p><p>\"I know, Sis. It's okay. I'm not blaming you, I just don't want you to be emotionally burdened.

Haha, this style of work clothing is almost outdated, so becoming tired of the aesthetics is inevitable. That's a good idea,\" on the side, a department chief flattered and fawned.</p><p>The truth was, most people at South Side were well informed, and there was no such thing as secrets. Everyone knew how much Director Wu valued Huo Mian, and the fact that Huo Mian operated all night and saved the life of Director Wu's niece.</p><p>So, Huo Mian's first suggestion was immediately backed up by one of the chiefs...</p><p>Song Lin also nodded her head, \"Director Wu, Huo Mian is right. We're a hospital after all, and our work outfits are better off being more formal.\"</p><p>\"Record this, we'll rectify it immediately after this,\" Director Wu told his assistant.</p><p>The male assistant immediately wrote it down on his notebook...</p><p>\"Anyone else?\" Director Wu looked around.</p><p>In fact, meetings on this topic were conducted every season, so people were all used to it, and nobody wanted to voice their opinions.</p><p>If their suggestions were good, they would get the titles like as*kisser or try-hard; and if they were bad, the director would say that their ideas were unrealistic.</p><p>There was a minute of silence...</p><p>Huo Mian looked left and right; she felt like nobody wanted to talk so she raised her hand again.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, go on,\" Director Wu called her name.</p><p>\"Director Wu, I believe that we need to correct the environment of South Side. The atmosphere here is near toxic. I don't know if you've heard rumors about South Side, but most of them are hard to bear. To be frank, South Side should aim to become the best rehabilitation center and put the recovery of patients first, instead of other irrelevant matters. The skills of our medical staff also need improvement. We can't live with ourselves if our patients suddenly fall into unstable conditions and we miss the best window of opportunity to save them. So, Director, I hope you can increase the number of skilled medical professionals situated at our hospital. Furthermore, the nurses need to improve upon their professional standards. I suggest implementing regular training, assessments, and a reward and punishment system to muster up everyone's enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. Finally, Director, I hope that you can wipe out the toxic environment at South Side once and for all, and return a healthy medical facility to the citizens. That's all, thank you for listening.\"</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded after Huo Mian's speech...</p><p>At last, it was Director Wu who led a thunderous round of applause. He shot her a look of approval.</p><p>Huo Mian was a good seed, he wasn't wrong about her...</p><p>\"What Huo Mian said was very good. Everybody, don't be afraid to speak your mind.\"</p><p>\"Director, I heard that Head Nurse Huo graduated from a local third-rate university, and she didn't even major in health science. She's still young, and some of her ideas may only work on paper. Reorganization doesn't happen overnight, please reconsider this before you put her plans into action.\"</p><p>Of course, there would be a voice of disapproval...</p><p>The man who spoke was one of the deputy directors of South Side, Guo Yumin. He practiced medicine for twenty years before being promoted to deputy.</p><p>It was a known fact that he had a horrible reputation and often enforced unspoken rules on pretty nurses in the hospital. However, nobody dared to cross him.</p><p>He had never crossed paths with Huo Mian, since she wasn't a beauty who enticed him.</p><p>However, Huo Mian's coworker Tingting was one of his bedmates. So, he remembered who Huo Mian was after Tingting complained about her several times.</p><p>Seeing Huo Mian shine today made him feel like she was stealing his spotlight, and this greatly displeased him.</p><p>After hearing what he said, Huo Mian smiled, \"Deputy director, your words err. One's education does not determine one's capability. You can't refute my suggestion due to my education, that is unfair.\"</p><p>\"Fairness? Is listening to a nurse with zero experience blabber nonsense fair? How dare you talk about reorganization?\"</p><p>\"But aren't we here today to freely suggest opinions of our own?\" Huo Mian argued back.</p><p>\"Making a suggestion means to logically treat a problem, not delusionally break traditions.\" It was clear that the deputy director did not want to reorganize South Side.</p><p>\"Deputy Director, I've always been logical, and my analysis is unbiased. South Side really does need to raise its professional, civility, and medical standards. This way, we'll be better set for the long run,\" Huo Mian calmly replied.</p><p>\"So… what qualifications do you have to lecture experienced doctors like us who have been practicing medicine for years?\" The deputy director's face became cloudy.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":279,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:08.84","Link":"Chapter-279","NameDisplay":"Chapter 279"},{"ID":18112095093276762,"Name":"Chapter 280: Correcting the Toxic Environment (2)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 280: Correcting the Toxic Environment (2)","Description":"<p>Chapter 280: Correcting the Toxic Environment (2)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Song Lin couldn't watch it anymore, so she rose up and said, \"Deputy Director, I am the one who recommended Huo Mian's promotion, and I favor and understand her. She saved a pregnant woman's life at the First Hospital and performed an emergency C-section. A few days ago, she also saved Director Wu's niece, Doctor Wu Xiaoxue. Isn't she qualified enough?\"</p><p>\"It's an idiotic display of individualism. While she attempted at showing off, she almost dragged our hospital's century-old reputation down with her.\"</p><p>Huo Mian elegantly smiled, rose up and politely nodded to the doctors and executives seated around her before asking, \"Deputy Director, I've heard that you used to specialize in neurology, is that correct?\"</p><p>\"Yes, what about it?\" the deputy director replied to Huo Mian with an arrogant attitude.</p><p>\"Good, then Deputy Director, as an expert in neurology, you obviously know the rules surrounding the aftercare of neurologically ill patients?\"</p><p>\"Do you have to ask such a simple question?\"</p><p>\"South Side's database shows that although we receive huge amounts of patients with neurological illnesses every year, there are very few who actually recovered. Why is that?\"</p><p>\"Ha, it's widely known that it is difficult to cure patients suffering from neurological disorders. Even hospitals cannot cure them, how could we, as a recuperation center? Are you kidding me?\"</p><p>\"I'm not kidding, I am being very serious. It's true that it is difficult to cure neurologically-ill patients, but clinical experiments conducted in the United States showed that if their aftercare was proper, the burden on them would be mitigated. It could be said that the aftercare is even more important than the pre-surgical treatment. However, as a medical expert, you do not value this fact. This leads to the outflow of many neurological patients each and every year. I'm no expert in this field, and I have no professional qualifications, but I've read books and observed the conditions of the patients at medical school and the First Hospital, so I have done quite a bit of research. Deputy Director, would you like to hear me out?\"</p><p>\"Sure, I'd like to see how you, an ignorant nurse, analyze the Neurology Division.\" In the deputy director's viewpoint, Huo Mian's behavior was laughable and self-incriminating, since doctors without specialization would for sure have a hard time answering knowledge-based questions in this field.</p><p>Huo Mian held up her cup and drank some water before glancing at those around her. \"What I am about to say only represents what I think. If I make a mistake, please excuse me.\"</p><p>Director Wu shot her an encouraging look and nodded to give her permission...</p><p>She nodded back and began speaking, \"The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord, and there is also the peripheral nervous system that includes our motor and sensory neurons throughout our entire body. Some symptoms surrounding neurological disorders are speech, movement, and cognitive impairments, sensory and consciousness disturbances, fits of syncope, seizure, amnesia, and cerebral palsy.\"</p><p>\"Regarding the aftercare of such patients, their care must reach the following standards: one, maintain the cleanliness, tidiness, and airflow of the room. More severe patients must have the number of times they can be visited limited.\"</p><p>\"Second is their rest and sleeping position. For chronic patients, they must be encouraged to exercise, but we must not tire them out. Patients with cognitive impairment and respiratory secretion must rest in a semi-supine or lateral position.\"</p><p>\"Third, regarding nutrition and diet, patients must consume more fresh fruits and vegetables to prevent constipation. Patients with complicated dysphagia should carefully follow a semi-fluid diet, administered at a slow pace to prevent choking and suffocation. As for patients with severe dysphagia, they should be fed through a nasal tube and kept at a semi-upright position for up to an hour after feeding.\"</p><p>\"In addition to the above, the recuperation process also involves the care of skin, airways, lifestyle, excrement, medication as well as observation of the illness. Particular patients may also need post-cerebrovascular surgery aftercare. Outpatients must be instructed, booked for regular appointments, and be given precautions. Patients with increasing intracranial blood pressure must be forbidden from having s*x and receive lumbar punctures periodically to prevent cerebral palsy.\"</p><p>\"In consideration of time, I won't go through the above one by one, because I believe you all understand what I mean. Overall, I believe that as a recuperation center, we have a great deal of responsibility and obligation towards the late-stage recovery of patients, and I hope that you all take this into serious consideration. Thank you.\"</p><p>Huo Mian did not stumble or repeat a single word. Her speed wasn't fast and her voice was clear.</p><p>After speaking those words, the older specialized doctors were all dumbfounded...</p><p>Deputy Director Guo's facial expression changed again and again...</p><p>Huo Mian's speech seemed to have come from somebody with a Ph.D. in neurology, not just a regular head nurse.</p><p>\"Deputy Director Guo, what do you think about what Huo Mian said?\" Director Wu asked Guo Yumin in a meaningful tone.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":280,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:09.327","Link":"Chapter-280","NameDisplay":"Chapter 280"},{"ID":18112095098714428,"Name":"Chapter 281: Correcting the Toxic Environment (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 281: Correcting the Toxic Environment (3)","Description":"<p>Chapter 281: Correcting the Toxic Environment (3)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"It was… fine.\" Although Deputy Director Guo didn't want to admit the cruel truth, he couldn't lie in front of so many experts.</p><p>\"Thank you, Deputy Director.\" Huo Mian smiled at him.</p><p>Director Wu waved. \"Sit down, Huo Mian.\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded and sat down...</p><p>Director Wu added many things to the discussion before ending the meeting an hour later.</p><p>When Huo Mian was walking out, Director Wu's assistant stopped her, \"Wait, Huo Mian, the director wants to talk to you.\"</p><p>The people in the meeting room left slowly, and soon, only Huo Mian and Director Wu were left in the room.</p><p>\"Huo Mian, you did well today.\"</p><p>\"No, I'm just stating facts.\" Huo Mian was a little shy.</p><p>\"I'll make improvements based on your suggestions. Actually… South Side should've been fixed long ago, it was just that at every single meeting, people beat around the bushes and nobody wanted to take the lead. Sadly, I never had an excuse to implement any new policies. You speaking out today made me feel much better. You're right, doctors should act like doctors, and they can't work in a foul environment.\"</p><p>\"Eh, Director, don't listen to my blabber, I'm just stating my opinions, haha.\"</p><p>\"No, your opinions were very useful and I learned a lot from them. There's only one thing that I regret.\"</p><p>\"What is it?\" Huo Mian was a little confused.</p><p>\"You have such a great gift, why don't you try for a medical degree while you're still young? If you start now, you'll definitely find success in the medical field. Last week, the British Royal Hospital gave us an exchange opportunity. It's a 6-month ophthalmology discussion and exchange program. I really want you to go, what do you think?\"</p><p>\"Director Wu, I'm not familiar in the field of ophthalmology, haha.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to hide it from me, I know. Before Xiaoxue and Ning Zhiyuan got married, I got somebody to investigate into him. You wrote all of his ophthalmology papers for him, is that correct?\"</p><p>\"Uh…\" Being exposed made Huo Mian quite uncomfortable.</p><p>\"Sorry, Director Wu. I shouldn't have lied to you for him.\"</p><p>\"No, you didn't do anything wrong. I only feel that your talent is wasted by merely being a nurse here at South Side. Even if you succeed and choose to leave the hospital, that's still fine by me. I still want to hone and train you.\"</p><p>\"Director Wu, thank you for the opportunity, but… I don't want to go to England. I think that my current occupation is great. It's fulfilling, engaging, and meaningful. I believe that in life, one's fame or riches don't equate success. As long as I set goals and do my job, life is meaningful. For example, ordinary sanitation workers clean the streets day after day, but it's because of them that our city is clean. We can't say that they're wasted doing that, we can only say that people have their own goals in life. As for me, I want a quiet and peaceful life, one that I can spend with my family. I want to work at a job I enjoy and retire when the time comes. I don't have big dreams, and I can be happy living a plain life.\"</p><p>\"I finally see why Dr. Qin treats you so well… Anyways, you're an excellent girl, I believe that you'll always be happy like you are now.\"</p><p>Director Wu's words were not direct, but someone as smart as him had guessed Huo Mian and Qin Chu's relationship already.</p><p>\"Thank you for your blessing.\"</p><p>After saying farewell to Director Wu and leaving the conference room, Huo Mian's mood was quite joyous. She sincerely hoped that South Side could change for the better.</p><p>It could be a green recuperation center, not a yellow and tainted one...</p><p>If she remembered right, this was the third time Director Wu talked about sending her abroad to study.</p><p>To others, the opportunity may have been once in a lifetime, but she rejected it so nonchalantly.</p><p>In fact, to Huo Mian, the biggest happiness came from being alongside Qin Chu. She already had no other ambitions.</p><p>When she got home from work, Qin Chu had just gotten back as well and was making dinner.</p><p>Huo Mian walked in and embraced Qin Chu's waist from the back in a teasing manner.</p><p>\"Mr. Qin, thanks for your hard work.\"</p><p>\"Are you hungry?\" Qin Chu turned around. He tilted Huo Mian's face up gently and asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":281,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:09.873","Link":"Chapter-281","NameDisplay":"Chapter 281"},{"ID":181120950103933731,"Name":"Chapter 282: Correcting the Toxic Environment (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 282: Correcting the Toxic Environment (4)","Description":"<p>Chapter 282: Correcting the Toxic Environment (4)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Mhm, I'm hungry.

She changed into a light red tracksuit, washed her hands, and then went back downstairs.</p><p>Qin Chu had already placed the food on the dining table...</p><p>It was actually… a seafood feast...</p><p>Spicy stir-fried crabs, steamed crabs, boiled clams, garlic-steamed scallops, boiled conch, and her favorite - steamed mantis shrimp.</p><p>\"Did you go to the seafood market?\"</p><p>\"No, I got someone from GK to buy it from some fishermen off the boat. Seafood is fresher when you buy it like that.\"</p><p>\"Honey, you know me so well.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was drooling over the table full of seafood...</p><p>\"Eat as much as you want. But before that, drink some ginger tea to warm up your tummy.\" After speaking, Qin Chu handed her a bowl of ginger and brown sugar tea.</p><p>Huo Mian's heart felt warm from Qin Chu's detailed care.</p><p>\"But you'll get enteritis from eating seafood! What are you going to eat?\" Huo Mian was a little worried.</p><p>\"I made some pickled vegetables and pork noodles for myself.\"</p><p>\"Uh… But doesn't it seem like I'm bullying you by eating a seafood feast and making you eat noodles?\"</p><p>\"I don't think you've ever been on top of me (TL: in Chinese, the second half of the word bully also means being on top; so yeah, great play on words… Big Boy Qin) yet since we got married.\"</p><p>\"Pff… Mr. Qin, don't be so dirty, I'm being serious here.\"</p><p>\"I've always been serious.\" Qin Chu lowered his head and ate a mouthful of noodles.</p><p>\"Fine, fine. I knew you were just teasing me. Honey, Director Wu held a meeting today, and he said… he said he wanted to send me to the British Royal Hospital to be an exchange doctor. What do you think?\" Huo Mian purposefully asked.</p><p>After speaking, she secretly glanced to see Qin Chu's reaction...</p><p>As she had expected, Qin Chu's hand paused for a second before he raised his head and looked at Huo Mian, \"The Royal Hospital has a great global reputation, and it's great that you have an opportunity to go. \"</p><p>\"But I would be gone for 6 months. Won't you miss me?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Qin Chu's reply was crisp and clear.</p><p>Huo Mian was a little disappointed… She lowered her head and silently ate the mantis shrimp.</p><p>Just then, Qin Chu added, \"I'll go to England with you. I will still have to see you every day, what is there to miss?\"</p><p>\"You'll going to England too? What about GK?\" Huo Mian's eyes opened wide.</p><p>\"That's my father's business, not mine.\"</p><p>\"Honey... you're too great,\" Huo Mian said sweetly and then smiled, \"I'm actually just teasing you, I already rejected Director Wu's offer. I'm not going to England because my family is here and I don't want to leave. I'm already satisfied with my life as it is.\"</p><p>\"Mian, if you really want to go, I'll go with you.\" Qin Chu knew that learning medicine had always been Huo Mian's greatest pursuit.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, \"I don't want to go anymore. Everyone has different dreams at different stages of their lives. I may have wanted to be a doctor a long time ago, but now, I am perfectly satisfied. Why should I change my life now?\"</p><p>\"No matter what you decide, I'll support you.\"</p><p>\"If you're an emperor, you must be an incapable one, haha, focusing so much on your queen,\" Huo Mian gleefully laughed.</p><p>\"It won't matter as long as you're the reason for my incapacity, right?\" </p><p>The seafood feast rendered Huo Mian fully satisfied, and the two of them cuddled to sleep. The next morning, Huo Mian went to work early.</p><p>It was already 8:45 AM when Tingting strolled in late...</p><p>\"Traffic jam,\" Tingting simply said, as she did not realize the consequences of her tardiness.</p><p>\"Five minutes late is a fine of a hundred yuan, ten minutes is two hundred. You're fifteen minutes late. Before eleven o'clock, please pay your three-hundred-yuan fine at the Finance Department,\" Huo Mian spoke in a formal tone.</p><p>\"What gives you the right to do that?\" Tingting was immediately furious as she looked at Huo Mian angrily.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":282,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:10.397","Link":"Chapter-282","NameDisplay":"Chapter 282"},{"ID":181120950109015857,"Name":"Chapter 283: Correcting the Toxic Environment (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 283: Correcting the Toxic Environment (5)","Description":"<p>Chapter 283: Correcting the Toxic Environment (5)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Because I'm your supervisor.\"</p><p>\"Don't think you can do whatever you want just because you're the head nurse.

The changes at South Side were already approved; she and the other head nurses already had a meeting.</p><p>They decided to target the nurses with bad behavior, one by one. Anyone who arrived late or left work early would be fined, and any mistakes at work would also be recorded.</p><p>Director Wu quickly approved the changes and decided to completely rectify the behaviors at South Side.</p><p>As a leader of the changes in the hospital, even though Huo Mian's professional conduct was admirable, she was still criticized, hated, and isolated by a lot of people.</p><p>During lunch, no one wanted to sit with her. They all gossiped about her behind her back.</p><p>But Huo Mian was already used to this kind of treatment, and she never cared about what others said about her.</p><p>In the afternoon, Huo Mian went to check up on room 2 and discovered that Grandpa Liu had already packed his things.</p><p>\"Grandpa, you're being discharged this afternoon, right?\"</p><p>\"Yes, it's already been two months.

Who is the lucky guy? Anyways, during this time, you took great care of me. Let's keep in touch.

I'll ask the car to wait for me.\"</p><p>\"Ah, I don't think that's a good idea.\" Huo Mian seemed reluctant.</p><p>\"Please, just one match? Don't go easy on me this time, let's both use all we've got.\" After speaking, without giving Huo Mian a chance to finish her words, Grandpa Liu had already started setting up the chess pieces.</p><p>Huo Mian did not have the heart to reject his wishes, so she had no choice but to play with him.</p><p>In the end, Huo Mian won marginally.

I'll be back later tonight.\"</p><p>\"No drinking.\" Qin Chu only texted back two words.</p><p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p><p>Then, after work, Huo Mian and Song Lin drove to a Korean barbeque restaurant downtown.</p><p>The private room was not big but exquisitely decorated with a tatami design.</p><p>After taking off her uniform, Song Lin was quite sexy since her chest was large.</p><p>Compared to her, Huo Mian's chest seemed flat, and she looked like an innocent high school student.</p><p>\"Director Song, is there something on your mind?\"</p><p>\"No, I just simply admire you and wanted to have dinner with you,\" Song Lin said with a smile.</p><p>\"You admire me?\" Huo Mian was quite shocked.</p><p>\"I've heard quite a lot about you, but I didn't think you would reject the hospital director's offer to go abroad. Do you know how many people want to go to England?\"</p><p>\"Oh, that's not an opportunity for me.\"</p><p>\"Not many dared to speak up regarding implementing changes to South Side, but you did. You even publicly disagreed with the deputy director at the meeting. You're truly brave, here's a toast for you.\"</p><p>After speaking, without waiting for Huo Mian to respond, Song Lin chugged a glass of beer...</p><p>Huo Mian found it difficult to refuse, so she drank a glass too.</p><p>\"It's nothing really, I'm only speaking the truth. When I first came here, I knew that South Side had a bad reputation, but I was still willing to come. After I began working here, I discovered that the facility's equipment and environment were good, and it only had poor working conduct. It would be a shame to ruin a first-class rehabilitation center because of that. I only offered my suggestions, Director Wu was the one who accepted them.\"</p><p>\"Huo Mian, to be honest, a lot of people are saying that you are Director Wu's mistress…\" Song Lin said slowly as she stared into Huo Mian's eyes.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":284,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:11.593","Link":"Chapter-284","NameDisplay":"Chapter 284"},{"ID":18112095012907046,"Name":"Chapter 285: Does Your Mom Know That You Are This Fierce?

This is because… to get ahead, I tried to seduce him too when I first arrived at South Side. I was not only unsuccessful, I almost got fired.\"</p><p>\"Holy… you are very brave.\"</p><p>\"I couldn't help it. Back then, my child was sick and needed money so I was desperate. After Director Wu learned about my situation, he gave me a grant on behalf of the hospital. He even contacted specialists in the field. I am very grateful for all that he has done for me, that's why I've stayed at South Side this whole time.\" Song Lin began to be a bit choked on her words.</p><p>\"Yeah, Director Wu is very righteous. He is just too strict so a lot of people are afraid of him.\"</p><p>\"I know. That's why I am very grateful you spoke up and did so much for the hospital. It's good to be young and not to have to think about your future, family, or anything. You can do whatever you want to do. Huo Mian, can we be friends?

She's the CFO and she drank… If I anger her, I won't get my paycheck. In order to support our family, I needed to socialize with her.\"</p><p>\"Support our family? Yeah, Honey, you are so great.\"</p><p>\"Not too bad, not too bad, hehe,\" Huo Mian said guiltily.</p><p>\"So, if I resign my position as GK's President tomorrow, will you provide for me?\" </p><p>\"Umm…\"</p><p>\"My monthly expenses aren't that big, I only spend about seven to eight million yuan per month.

I honestly thought you left the dishes for me.\" </p><p>\"Are you sure you are smart? (TL: the author mentioned 130 again, don't worry, I took the bullet) Did you bribe the person who gave you the IQ test? Hmm?\" </p><p>Qin Chu felt like Huo Mian's reaction was like a silly girl, nothing like that of a genius. </p><p>\"I don't know why, but in front of you, my logical reasoning completely breaks down. Maybe you're the bug in my system,\" Huo Mian complained as she pouted her lips. </p><p>\"Haven't you heard of that saying?\" </p><p>\"What?\" Huo Mian was dazed. </p><p>\"There is always one thing in this world that conquers another.\"</p><p>\"So I'm conquered by you?\" Huo Mian asked.</p><p>\"No, I'm the one who was conquered by you.\" Qin Chu's answer was simple.</p><p>Huo Mian couldn't stop laughing, she hugged Qin Chu's neck and the two started to mess around again.</p><p>The truth was, even she herself did not realize that she had gradually become used to living with Qin Chu.</p><p>Everything was perfect, as long as they didn't bring up the unhappy matters of the past or their parents' attitudes towards them.</p><p>They lied in bed; Qin Chu hugged Huo Mian, his heart filled with happiness. </p><p>\"Mian.\" </p><p>\"Yeah?\" </p><p>\"When is your stupid hospital giving you a long vacation?\" </p><p>\"Uh… I haven't asked. I don't know when my vacation dates are.\" </p><p>\"I might go to Australia next month for business, and I want to bring you along with me. I feel bad that we've been married for so long yet I haven't taken you on a honeymoon yet.\" </p><p>\"Don't be. Like others said, if there is love, it's Valentine's Day every day.\" Huo Mian smiled and hugged Qin Chu tighter. </p><p>Qin Chu lowered his head and greedily took in her unique scent… </p><p>Then, he softly said, \"If we have kids in the future, I hope that their looks, intelligence, abilities, and characters take after me.\" </p><p>\"What about me?\" Huo Mian said as if she was wronged. </p><p>\"Their horoscope should take after you, a Virgo work maniac.\" </p><p>\"Qin Chu, you a*s!\" Huo Mian could not help herself from swearing because Qin Chu was too mean.</p><p>Why should their kid resemble him for everything and only have the same horoscope type as her? </p><p>What's the point of having the same horoscope? </p><p>\"They should take after my IQ okay?

Are you looking to die? It's fine if you want to die but I still want to live.\" Huo Mian was furious. </p><p>Weirdly, Su Yu was in a good mood when he saw how angry she was…</p><p>He finally had a reason to see her… </p><p>It took him an entire day to plan the collision. He had investigated Huo Mian's route to work, picked a spot for the collision, and collided into Huo Mian's car.</p><p>It was perfectly executed… </p><p>God knew how much he missed her.

If you don't want this car, I can buy you another one, you can choose whichever one you like. Or you can take this Ferrari, what do you think?\" Su Yu said with a smile as he pointed at the White Ferrari behind him. </p><p>\"It's okay. Like I said, I only want the repair fees, pay up!\" Huo Mian impatiently reached out her hand for the money. </p><p>\"I'll definitely give you the money but we need to follow protocol. The traffic police will come soon. They'll inspect the accident and call the insurance company. We'll go through due process.\" </p><p>\"That much trouble? It's okay then, I'm in a hurry to get to work. I'll leave my car here, call me after you fix it.

Su Yu, you're such a jinx!\" Huo Mian was about to faint. Nothing good had happened this morning! </p><p>\"A jinx is ugly, I'm more of a superstar.\" </p><p>\"Stop joking with me, get out of my way, I'm going to be late,\" Huo Mian said impatiently.</p><p>Just then, the traffic police arrived. They first greeted Su Yu respectfully, \"Young Master Su, good morning.\" </p><p>After looking at the scene, the traffic police said, \"As a beginner female driver, how could you take the viaduct during the morning rush hour? Your car also crossed the line while you were waiting for the red light. I'm going to confiscate your car, come with me and await further instructions.\" </p><p>Huo Mian almost vomited blood when she heard what the policeman said… </p><p>Just how much more crap could come out from this traffic police officer's mouth?! Even if he was trying to kiss Su Yu's a*s, he didn't have to do it to this extent, right?</p><p>He said that her car had crossed the line, was he blind? Her car was a huge distance away from the line! </p><p>Also, was there even a traffic law that stipulates that a new female driver couldn't take a viaduct during rush hour? It was not like she was driving on the highway! </p><p>Su Yu was clearly upset at the traffic policeman's decision as well, and he said coldly, \"I crashed into this girl's car because I was on my phone. I need to pay her back for the damages. She didn't cross the line, this accident is completely my fault.\" </p><p>\"Young Master Su…?\" The traffic police were completely stunned. </p><p>\"That's what happened, it's fully my responsibility. Write it down quickly,\" Su Yu said impatiently. </p><p>In the end, under Su Yu's instructions, the traffic police brought them back to the police station to record the accident. </p><p>Huo Mian could only delay a day of work and request a day off from her supervisor…</p><p>Finally, it was decided that Su Yu was fully responsible for the accident and for all of Huo Mian's car repair costs. </p><p>The truth was, the accident was only a small matter but the traffic police refused to let Huo Mian go. </p><p>All of Huo Mian's patience had worn off, and she felt like screaming at people. </p><p>She didn't want to trouble her husband, or she would've called Qin Chu and asked him to pick her up. </p><p>She believed that if Qin Chu was here, these traffic police would immediately turn into her lackeys… </p><p>What a bunch of snobs … </p><p>After walking out of the police station, Su Yu's was in a good mood, \"It's rare for us to meet again, let me treat you to a meal.\" </p><p>Huo Mian did not speak.

Why are you alone? Bored of girls?\" Huo Siqian chuckled.</p><p>\"Yeah, I had too much fun so I'm taking a break.\" Su Yu laughed.</p><p>\"You're in a good mood. How about you repair the business relationship between our families?

Congratulations in advance then.\" Huo Siqian held up his glass.</p><p>Su Yu didn't reply, but the corners of his lips lifted into a smile...</p><p>Thinking back to that morning when Huo Mian had kicked his car before leaving, holy f*ck was that face adorable.</p><p>How could a girl be so interesting? He had completely forgotten about the 150,000 yuan of repairs that her kick had costed him.</p><p>He still felt like he had won; a full morning with Huo Mian was totally worth it.</p><p>Suddenly, his phone rang; it was Zhao Qingya.</p><p>He declined the call and took a sip of his water.</p><p>\"Oh shoot! It seems like Miss Zhao's getting laid off. You're not even answering her calls?\" Tang Chuan asked, laughing.</p><p>Su Yu didn't reply...</p><p>\"I heard that there's a new girl in your company?

They're all important receipts.\"</p><p>\"Sorry, Director Jiang, the president is currently not seeing anyone.\"</p><p>\"Is there an important person inside?\" Jiang Linyue continued to ask.</p><p>Assistant Yang nodded and said, \"Yes, a person very important to the president is in there. It's best if you leave.\"</p><p>\"Is that person… the president's girlfriend?\"</p><p>\"That… I cannot tell you. It's the president's personal affairs, nothing we as employees should ask.\" Assistant Yang was never this cold.</p><p>- Inside the president's office -</p><p>Qin Chu was talking on his cell phone, discussing something about work...</p><p>Huo Mian opened up the box of desserts, spooned out a piece of tiramisu, and fed it to him.</p><p>To her surprise, Qin Chu actually opened his mouth and ate it...</p><p>He then took turns eating and giving out instructions for work.</p><p>The atmosphere was strange, but seeing this side of Qin Chu totally amused Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian opened her milk tea and took a sip.</p><p>Suddenly, she was pressed up against the window; her mouth was pried open, and the gulp of milk tea was all… stolen away.</p><p>Qin Chu had stolen her first sip of milk tea, even licking his lips afterward in satisfaction.</p><p>His expression was more than just a little seductive...</p><p>\"Eh… Young Master Qin, what are you doing?\" Huo Mian didn't know whether to cry or laugh.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":289,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:14.043","Link":"Chapter-289","NameDisplay":"Chapter 289"},{"ID":181120950145664091,"Name":"Chapter 290: Does Your Mom Know That You Are This Fierce?

Isn't this inappropriate?\"</p><p>\"This is my company and you are my wife. What's wrong with that?\" Qin Chu objected.</p><p>Huo Mian was speechless once again...</p><p>She had to admit, she could never keep her cool in front of Mr. Qin.</p><p>The afternoon tea took a long time to finish, thanks to their endless lovey-dovey sweetness.</p><p>It was only after Huo Mian's lips had become a bit swollen from the kissing did Qin Chu finally let her go.</p><p>As she left his office, Huo Mian lowered her head and walked quickly, afraid of being seen by anyone.</p><p>To her surprise, she bumped into someone at the elevators.</p><p>\"Sorry.\" Huo Mian immediately apologized.</p><p>\"No need to apologize.\" Jiang Linyue smiled elegantly.</p><p>She had waited for almost 40 minutes to catch a glimpse of the important guest inside the president's office.</p><p>As Huo Mian entered her sight, however, Jiang Linyue was disappointed...</p><p>The woman wasn't blessed with a face that could make a country fall for her, nor was her body anything to gawk at.</p><p>Even her clothes were normal as could be… other than a young and clean appearance, there was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>Huo Mian was headed for work in the morning and was therefore only dressed in a white blouse, a pair of casual black pants, and a pair of black flats, as old-fashioned as one could be. She was really nothing to look at, especially compared to a beautiful woman like Jiang Linyue.</p><p>\"Are you… a friend of the president?\" Jiang Linyue inquired.</p><p>\"Uh… yes.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>\"I've never seen you before. Is this your first time here?\"</p><p>\"Um… I think this is my second time.\" Huo Mian thought hard, trying to remember her last visit.</p><p>\"Are you the president's friend from the States?\" Jiang Linyue felt that ever since the president came back, he had been too busy to make any friends. It was more likely that the woman in front of her was someone he had met in America.</p><p>\"Not really, we've known each other for a long time...\" Huo Mian replied honestly.</p><p>\"Oh, that's great! President Qin is a very nice person. He's a dependable friend.\"</p><p>\"You seem to know a lot about your president?\" Huo Mian looked at Jiang Linyue.</p><p>Huo Mian was no fool, she could clearly sense the intentions behind the woman standing in front of her. Why else would a woman ask her so many random questions?</p><p>\"Let me introduce myself. My name is Jiang Linyue, the director of GK's Department of Luxury Good Designs and a valued assistant of the president. If you've ever followed our company's jewelry designs, I was the one one who created the currently popular ones on the market.\"</p><p>Jiang Linyue introduced herself proudly, wanting to intimidate Huo Mian and give her some pressure...</p><p>Unfortunately, Jiang Linyue didn't know about Huo Mian's input on the design. It was Huo Mian who had convinced Qin Chu to use her design in the first place.</p><p>Her arrogant speech was nothing more than embarrassing in front of Huo Mian.</p><p>Luckily for her, Huo Mian wasn't one to rudely expose her.</p><p>\"Oh yeah? That's really impressive.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"Thank you for the compliment.\"</p><p>Just then, the elevator arrived. Huo Mian walked in...</p><p>\"Are you coming?\" Huo Mian initiated an invite.</p><p>Just as Jiang Linyue decided to get in, she suddenly backed away as if she had suddenly thought of something.</p><p>\"No it's ok, I just thought of something I needed to do. See you next time,\" Jiang Linyue said smiling.</p><p>Because the elevator was dedicated to the president, it would've been difficult for her to explain herself if anyone saw her using it.</p><p>The woman in front of her, however, was allowed to use the elevator to her heart's content. Was she really that important to the president?</p><p>Was she the woman Mrs. Qin spoke of? The one that was sitting in the president's car?</p><p>As those thoughts raced through her mind, Jiang Linyue felt a gut-wrenching sense of impending loss.</p><p>At night, when Qin Chu arrived home, Huo Mian suddenly remembered the woman named Jiang Linyue. \"Honey, does Jiang Linyue from your company like you?\"</p><p>\"Why the sudden question?\" Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian, intrigued.</p><p>She wasn't the type to get jealous, so she wouldn't have asked without a reason.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":290,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:14.567","Link":"Chapter-290","NameDisplay":"Chapter 290"},{"ID":18112095015617853,"Name":"Chapter 291: Does Your Mom Know That You Are This Fierce?

He was going to chauffeur her around until she gets her car back. It's the only way he would stop worrying.</p><p>\"But there's no time for breakfast anymore.\"</p><p>\"I've already packed your breakfast. You can eat it on the way.\"</p><p>\"Honey, you… are amazing.\" Huo Mian was completely touched. She shot up from the bed and quickly got ready.</p><p>Grabbing breakfast, they got into Qin Chu's car...</p><p>Soy milk and Chinese Donut Sticks, a winning combination; it was the most authentic Chinese breakfast and Huo Mian's longtime favorite.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't take the first bite, instead, she took the Chinese Donut Stick and held it up to Qin Chu's mouth.</p><p>After Qin Chu took a bite, Huo Mian took a bite.</p><p>They took turns taking bites throughout the entire car ride, both content as could be...</p><p>Thanks to Qin Chu's escorting, Huo Mian arrived at South Side right on time.</p><p>\"I'm here. Be careful on the way.\"</p><p>\"I'll pick you up when you get off work.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" Huo Mian smiled and waved Qin Chu goodbye.</p><p>She was having a fantastic morning, but everything changed when she saw the person standing beside the doors.</p><p>\"Why are you here?\"</p><p>\"Little sister Mian, can you come up with another greeting the next time you see me? Am I that annoying?\" Huo Siqian was dressed in a coffee-colored casual wear sweater, his face holding a touch of laughter.</p><p>Huo Siqian was actually quite handsome, a debonair really, with eyes that could draw in anyone when he smiles...</p><p>Many women fancied him, all recognizing him as a suave gentleman who could talk his way to any woman's heart.</p><p>Huo Mian was an exception, however, as her expression fell every time she saw him...</p><p>It had always been that way, ever since their first meeting when Huo Mian was only 10 years old, during which he gave her a box of Dove chocolates and she threw directly to the ground.</p><p>She had never accepted anything from the Huo family, therefore, she always declined Huo Siqian's nice and caring gestures.</p><p>\"I don't like you, and the entire world knows that. Why should I hide it?\" Huo Mian said coldly.</p><p>\"I need a better news source. I can't believe I didn't know about your promotion. It's all my fault. Here, a gift for your promotion.\" Then, Huo Siqian handed over a delicate cotton box.</p><p>Opening the box, Huo Mian discovered a beautiful Cartier bracelet; it was the newest design and it was dazzling...</p><p>The English letters 'Mian' was carved on its outer rim; clearly, it was custom made.</p><p>The bracelet definitely didn't look cheap...</p><p>\"Thank you, but I don't need it.\"</p><p>\"Isn't it natural for an older brother to give a present to his younger sister? Why are you rejecting it?\"</p><p>\"I've never seen myself as your younger sister or you as my older brother.\"</p><p>\"Mian, I've never seen you as an enemy. I'm different from Huo Siyi and Huo Yanyan.\"</p><p>\"Huo Siqian, I can't help you. No matter how hard you try, I won't go back and help you fight against Shen Jiani.\"</p><p>Huo Mian had always thought that Huo Siqian was only nice to her because she was useful to him...</p><p>Huo Siqian gazed at Huo Mian meaningfully and asked, \"Do you really think that I'm only nice to you because you're useful to me?\"</p><p>\"Why else?\"</p><p>\"Haha… everyone says you're a genius but I really don't see it. You can be really silly sometimes.\"</p><p>\"You're dumb, your entire family's dumb.\"</p><p>\"Aren't you included in my family? Your IQ really needs some elevating.\" Huo Siqian chuckled, completely unbothered by Huo Mian's rejection.</p><p>\"I don't have time for this nonsense. I need to work. Please move.\"</p><p>\"Your job today is to keep me company.\"</p><p>Huo Mian froze for a second...</p><p>Huo Siqian continued, \"I donated 30,000,000 yuan to South Side's new sanatorium so your deputy director agreed to let you, the little head nurse show me around.\"</p><p>\"Huo Siqian, you really are crazy...\" Huo Mian was completely stunned by Huo Siqian's ridiculous action of donating 30,000,000 yuan just to walk around with her.</p><p>\"What's wrong with acting crazy once in a while?

She and Qin Chu had always been extremely discrete, even going as far as doing everything in their power to hide their tracks.

Huo Mian has always been the most excellent employee at South Side. Everyone takes good care of her.\" After Guo Yumin learned about the relationship between Huo Siqian and Huo Mian, he had nothing but compliments for her.</p><p>He had read about Huo Mian being the Huo Family's illegitimate daughter in the newspaper before. But at the time, Huo Mian had clearly stated her independence from the Huo family, even announcing that she would never be in contact with them.</p><p>He had always seen Huo Mian as someone unthreatening, but Huo Siqian's appearance changed his mind.</p><p>Not only did the man donate money, but he also made his intentions of having his little sister taken care of very clear.

Rather, he drove to South Side to pick Huo Mian up from work.</p><p>After he arrived, Qin Chu sent her a WeChat message. \"I'm here.\"</p><p>Three minutes later, Huo Mian ran out of the hospital and found Qin Chu's car parked 500 meters from the entrance.</p><p>Of course, this was her request; she didn't want her colleagues to see her being dropped off and picked up by such a luxurious car. People were going to talk about it.</p><p>\"You're off work early today.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>\"Yeah, what do you want to eat?\"</p><p>\"We can buy some food and cook at home, what do you feel like eating?\" Huo Mian was in a good mood.</p><p>\"I asked Gao Ran if he wants to have dinner together, and he asked us to pick the restaurant.\"</p><p>\"You asked Gao Ran again?

We should get them to date each other.\"</p><p>\"That's not it, Gao Ran's bringing a date.\"</p><p>\"Oh really? Gao Ran got himself a girlfriend?\" Huo Mian was surprised.</p><p>\"I'm not completely sure, we'll find out when we see them.\"</p><p>Qin Chu didn't say more and took Huo Mian downtown to walk around.</p><p>In the end, Huo Mian said that she wanted Sichuan food, so he parked outside a famous Sichuan restaurant.</p><p>Then, Qin Chu called Gao Ran, and gave him the location.</p><p>15 minutes later, Gao Ran arrived. A girl wearing a light beige dress got off his Jaguar with him.</p><p>She looked about 23 or 24 years old. She had big eyes, fair skin, and long black hair, the typical pretty girl looks.</p><p>Truth be told, her temperament was incomparable to Zhu Lingling; she looked soft and meek, like someone who was extremely coquettish.</p><p>Unlike Zhu Lingling and her, who were all-out iron ladies…</p><p>\"Have you guys been waiting long?\" Gao Ran walked in with his date and smiled.</p><p>\"Not too long, just 15 minutes.\" Qin Chu's sense of time was always strong.</p><p>Gao Ran broke into a smile, \"Hey, President Qin's time is valuable, thanks for waiting for us for an entire 15 minutes.

The room wasn't big, but more than enough for the four of them.</p><p>\"This is…\" Huo Mian glanced at Gao Ran's date and asked.</p><p>\"She's a friend, Lin Xuejiao.\"</p><p>\"Just a friend?

We usually just have dinner and hang out, and we don't really talk about that stuff,\" Huo Mian said as she realized that this girl was there to get information from her. How pragmatic was she to ask about Gao Ran's family background as soon as she opened her mouth? Did she mistake Huo Mian for someone who didn't know when to keep her mouth shut?</p><p>\"Oh, I see. I'm the only child and my parents spoiled me, so they don't want me to date someone poor because they don't want me to live a hard life. Truth be told, Captain Gao's really nice and good looking. But the nature of his profession is dangerous, so we didn't start dating yet. This is something that I'm taking into consideration.\"</p><p>Huo Mian looked at her, bewildered, \"You're young, but you seem to consider things thoroughly. However, shouldn't you find someone you like? Do other factors really matter? If you date him because of his other factors, does that count as liking someone?\"</p><p>\"I like him, but the other factors are just as important, and I have to keep my eyes open. After all, love can't replace bread, am I right?\" Lin Xuejiao batted her innocent eyes, but each word she spoke reeked of reality.</p><p>\"Not everyone is born rich. The rich to the poor proportion in China is 2 to 8, so not all of us can marry into a rich family. However, we can make sure that we find a man who has potential and takes responsibilities for his actions. Humans create their own futures. But if a man's moral standing is lacking, it doesn't matter how great his other factors are, he'll fail all the same.\"</p><p>\"You have a point, but even if those with billions go bankrupt, they will still have millions. However, do you know how long I would have to wait if I marry someone with nothing to begin with? Ten years, twenty years? Us girls aren't forever young; who has the time to wait for a poor man to become rich?\"</p><p>Huo Mian was shocked at what the girl said…</p><p>She was around her age, but her maturity was on par with a woman who was in her thirties or forties. It wasn't wrong for her parents to raise her up to be so realistic, but she was still young and was at an age when she was supposed to fall madly in love.

It's been fixed. I promise that when I crash into it next time, I will try to be gentler.\"</p><p>Next time? There was going to be a 'next time'? And next time he would be gentler? What was that supposed to mean? Is he going to control the crash's severity too now?</p><p>Furious, Huo Mian grabbed the lilies from the car and threw it onto the ground. Then, she smeared the bouquet with her foot.</p><p>\"Hey, Head Nurse, what's going on?\" Nannan had just arrived. When she was passing by, she saw Huo Mian smearing the flowers, so she went up to ask her.</p><p>\"Nothing, some pervert brought me flowers.

You don't need to work as a double agent anymore. Don't ever go see my mother again, and you don't have to keep secrets for me, I already told her everything last night.\"</p><p>\"President Qin…\" Jiang Linyue was shocked at how cold and unreasonable Qin Chu was.</p><p>\"You can get your reward from the Finance Department. Never step into my house again. That's all.\"</p><p>\"President Qin, I don't want a reward, I just want…\"</p><p>\"Leave.\" Qin Chu chased her out before she even had a chance to finish her sentence.</p><p>He didn't have time to listen to women cry about stuff. He didn't care about any woman, except for Huo Mian.</p><p>Jiang Linyue had tears in her eyes when she left the President's office. She was in a crappy mood.</p><p>\"Director Jiang are you okay?\" Even Assistant Yang noticed that something was wrong.</p><p>Jiang Linyue shook her head and ran downstairs…</p><p>She was down in the dumps that entire day…</p><p>She tried her best to perform well at the office and had always worked overtime, just so Qin Chu would notice her.</p><p>However, just when she thought that she was close to victory, everything went to crap.</p><p>She could tell that Mrs. Qin had given up on her; it was apparent from her attitude last night.</p><p>If she still wanted to fantasize about a future with him, she had to rely on herself.</p><p>Jiang Linyue cried at her desk for a long time before finally gracefully wiping off her swollen eyes with a tissue.</p><p>Did Qin Chu ignore her because of that woman?</p><p>If that woman disappeared from this world, then would she have a chance?</p><p>At this thought, Jiang Linyue pulled herself together; a vicious light flashed past her eyes.</p><p>- Lunchtime, employee cafeteria -</p><p>Jiang Lingyue walked up to Assistant Yang and put her plate down across from him.</p><p>\"May I sit here?' Jiang Linyue smiled.</p><p>\"Please, Director Jiang.\" Yang was very polite to Jiang Linyue. He thought that she was not only pretty but also capable. She was also very well liked within the company and had never been involved in an office scandal.</p><p>\"Assistant Yang, the president hasn't been going on business trips recently, right?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, the president doesn't seem to like going on business trips. Even if he went, he would come back on the same day, even if it is late at night.\" Yang was already aware of the president's love for his home.</p><p>\"Is the president… in love with someone?\" Jiang Linyue finally asked the question she was interested in.</p><p>\"I'm not sure, I don't have the courage to ask about his private life.\"</p><p>\"The woman that came to the president's office last time was probably his girlfriend, right?\"</p><p>\"I'm… not so sure.\" Yang was not calculating, but he wasn't stupid either. He only vaguely answered Jiang Linyue's question.</p><p>\"Director Jiang, you seem to be interested in the president,\" Yang asked her.</p><p>\"Oh, Mrs. Qin keeps asking me about him, but I don't get to hang out around the president very often, so I feel bad about not being able to answer Mrs. Qin's questions.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I see.\" Yang smiled and didn't say anything else.</p><p>As they were finishing up, Jiang Linyue suddenly asked, \"Assistant Yang, you must know the president's new address, right?\"</p><p>\"You want the president's new address?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, Mrs. Qin said that she was worried about the president living by himself and afraid that he wouldn't take care of himself properly. She asked me to buy some daily necessities for him, but I don't even know where he lives. Isn't that awkward?\" Jiang Linyue smiled.</p><p>Yang struggled; he wasn't sure if she was telling the truth.

The president had a weird temper that Yang couldn't understand, but truth to be told, he treated his employees well, and a lot of people were jealous of Yang's salary.</p><p>Therefore, even if it was the chairman or Mrs. Qin who came looking for information, he would still keep his mouth shut.</p><p>Being loyal to his boss was what he lived by; he didn't want to be a half-hearted person.</p><p>After Huo Mian got off work, she felt like shopping and wanted to buy a pair of shoes for the new season.</p><p>She went to Wanda Square downtown. Huo Mian was carrying a white backpack and wearing a grey sports outfit with a cute Totoro on it. She looked young, like a freshman from college.</p><p>After shopping around for a while, she didn't find anything, so she decided to stop by Starbucks for coffee.</p><p>She saw two familiar faces as soon as she went in…</p><p>If she wasn't mistaken, were those two… Ning Zhiyuan and He Man?</p><p>Why were they together?</p><p>Just then, Ning Zhiyuan looked up and was a little surprised to see Huo Mian.</p><p>He Man noticed Ning Zhiyuan's reaction and looked up as well. Then, she sneered at Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't plan on saying hi to them…</p><p>She found a seat and sat down. Then, she ordered an iced mocha.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan, on the other hand, lost his cool. He stood up and walked over to her, \"Mian, are you here alone?\"</p><p>Huo Mian nodded but didn't say anything…</p><p>\"I didn't get to thank you for last time, let me buy you dinner sometime.\"</p><p>\"No, thank you.\" Huo Mian's voice was faint and indifferent.</p><p>Just then, He Man got up as well. She walked up to them and casually placed her hand on Ning Zhiyuan's shoulder, and smiled at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"What a coincidence, I'm surprised to see you here. I heard that you were promoted to head nurse, not bad.\"</p><p>Huo Mian looked up and coldly glanced at He Man. \"News sure travels fast.\"</p><p>The truth was that she hated He Man, because she felt like He Man was overly dark and twisted.</p><p>She wasn't like Wu Xiaoxue, who openly hated Huo Mian. She would never do anything despicable behind people's backs.</p><p>He Man, on the other hand, enjoyed scheming whilst hiding in the dark. She was very petty.</p><p>Even calling her a manipulative b*tch would be complimenting her.</p><p>\"This is a big deal, of course, I know about it. You must have performed very well to be promoted so fast. I heard that Deputy Director Guo likes innocent-looking woman like you. You really do look innocent from the outside.\"</p><p>Obviously, He Man was insinuating that the only reason why she was promoted was that she was Deputy Director Guo's side piece.</p><p>However, to her surprise, Huo Mian smiled, \"You already resigned from the hospital, so you should probably stop gossiping about others. Sometimes less is more.\"</p><p>Then, Huo Mian glanced at Ning Zhiyuan and warned him, \"If I'm not mistaken, you're married to Wu Xiaoxue, who's pregnant right now. You shouldn't be doing things that you shouldn't be doing. After all… if Director Wu found out, it won't be good for your future prospects. Don't be greedy, and treasure what you have now.\"</p><p>\"Mian, you misunderstood, I only came to see her because…\" Ning Zhiyuan wanted to explain.</p><p>However, Huo Mian wasn't in the mood to listen. She stood up to leave, \"Sorry, I have to go.\"</p><p>\"She's still so despicable.\" He Man spat as she watched Huo Mian walk away.</p><p>\"He Man, why did you ask me to meet you? If you're not going to tell me, then I'm leaving.\" Having lost all his patience, Ning Zhiyuan turned around to look at He Man, his attitude a little harsh.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":301,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:20.52","Link":"Chapter-301","NameDisplay":"Chapter 301"},{"ID":18112095021241420,"Name":"Chapter 302: This Woman Is Too Capricious (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 302: This Woman Is Too Capricious (9)","Description":"<p>Chapter 302: This Woman Is Too Capricious (9)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Zhiyuan, I recently opened up a milk tea bar and it's under renovation.

I promise to pay you back. Ever since I left the hospital, I haven't been able to find a job. You know that Wu Xiaoxue basically blacklisted me from any of the hospitals, and I'm out of options…\" He Man said, tearing up as she looked at Ning Zhiyuan with puppy eyes.</p><p>Ning Zhiyuan felt nothing for He Man; when they dated, he just used her to fulfill his horny desires.</p><p>However, no man could be indifferent when a woman was crying in front of him.</p><p>Therefore, although Ning Zhiyuan was disgusted, he still asked, \"How much do you need?\"</p><p>\"Fifty thousand should be enough, I still have some savings left over.\" He Man's voice was soft as she looked at Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p>\"I don't have that much and all my money is in my wife's account. I have a little over twenty thousand left in my WeChat account, I'll transfer all that to you.\"</p><p>\"That's fine too.\"</p><p>Then, Ning Zhiyuan added He Man's WeChat and sent her 23,800 yuan.</p><p>After He Man confirmed the transaction, she smiled, \"Thank you, Zhiyuan, I promise I will pay you back.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to pay me back, take the money, but never come looking for me again.\" Then, Ning Zhiyuan turned on his heel and left.</p><p>He Man's expression slowly turned cold, \"Ning Zhiyuan, Wu Xiaoxue, and Huo Mian, trust me, I will make all of your lives hell. Just wait for it.\"</p><p>Huo Mian prepared dinner after she got home, but Qin Chu hadn't come back yet.</p><p>She took out her phone, sat down on the couch, and began messaging Zhu Lingling.</p><p>Zhu Lingling sent Huo Mian a photo of her rich boyfriend, and asked Huo Mian what she thought.</p><p>Huo Mian sent, \"You're too fierce, I don't have the courage to tell you what I think.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling replied, \"It's fine, tell me the truth, I won't get mad.\"</p><p>Huo Mian, \"Okay, remember it was you that insisted on hearing my opinion. Your boyfriend… is not that good looking. Gao Ran is much more handsome.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling, \"Why are you comparing him to that idiot Gao Ran? I don't find him handsome at all. Plus, I feel safe, dating someone ugly, at least he won't sleep around. Handsome men aren't reliable, there's no sense of security with I'm with them.\"</p><p>Then, Zhu Lingling immediately added, \"Of course, your husband, Mr. Qin, is an exception.\"</p><p>Huo Mian, \"I don't agree with your point of view. I don't think ugly people have a smaller chance of cheating. For example, a rich man would always have women swarming all over him, so if he does decide to date someone, it means that he's serious about her. On the other hand, no one likes ugly people, so he immediately sleeps with whoever that dates him. He would only marry someone because he has no other choice. You understand what I'm saying?\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling, \"What kind of weird logic is that?\"</p><p>Huo Mian, \"Girl, that's not weird logic. Here's another example: if a person has a hundred yuan, he'll be able to afford cola, sprite, or water. Therefore, if he buys water, it means that he actually likes to drink water. However, if a person only has two yuan, he'll only be able to afford water, so can you really believe him when he says that he likes to drink water? If you give him a bottle of cola, he'll still gladly drink it. An ugly man doesn't cheat because he doesn't have the chance to. If he comes across that opportunity, he will keep cheating, just to prove his manhood. People like that will never stop cheating either. Therefore, as women, we really need to keep our eyes open. We shouldn't date ugly people thinking that they won't cheat, because that's not the case.\" (Translator Note: just before people get offended, Huo Mian didn't mean ugly people will cheat for sure, she's just saying that the logic that people less good-looking won't cheat isn't necessarily true. Whether someone will cheat doesn't necessarily depend on their looks, so it's not a valid judgment on the person just because of their looks.)</p><p>Zhu Lingling, \"My gosh, Ms. Huo, I am greatly impressed by your weird logic. I think you've brainwashed me, I suddenly feel enlightened.\"</p><p>Huo Mian, \"Think about it, isn't that the case?\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling, \"It is, but not everyone is like you, lucky enough to meet the best man in the world to look after you when you were young. People like Qin Chu rarely exist in this world; you're lucky, but that doesn't mean that others are just as lucky.\"</p><p>Huo Mian, \"Gao Ran's not bad.

Humph.\" </p><p>Huo Mian smiled and didn't say anything else. Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling's history traced back seven years ago when she was still with Qin Chu. As Qin Chu's bro and Huo Mian's gal, Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling had a lot of opportunities to see each other. Therefore, for a while, their relationship started to see some subtle changes. But for some reason, it didn't turn into anything. Neither of them mentioned it, so Huo Mian didn't ask. It was a shame that Zhu Lingling and Gao Ran were both in relationships now.</p><p>Actually, she had always thought that they suited each other... </p><p>Bored, Huo Mian was browsing her friend circle on WeChat when she saw something funny that Zhixin posted. </p><p>So she re-posted right away. The post was, \"It is said that the feeling dads have when they first hear that their daughters found a boyfriend is like what farmers feel when they see the cabbages they put effort to plant for a season have been dug up by a pig.

I hardly ever see you post in your friend circle. We should grab something to eat someday.\" </p><p>Nannan, one of the nurses at South Side commented, \"Head Nurse, I didn't know you had a hilarious side like this.\" </p><p>Huo Mian took a look at everyone's comments and was intrigued. </p><p>Suddenly, another comment popped up… </p><p>She opened it, looked, and burst into laughter… </p><p>Qin Chu commented underneath, \"So are you the cabbage or the pig?\" </p><p>She immediately replied, \"Dude, of course you are the pig and I'm the cabbage.\" </p><p>\"But I'm the good-looking one between the two of us, aren't I?\" Qin Chu commented pridefully. </p><p>\"So do you want to kneel on the durian or the washboard when you get home, talking back to me like this?\" Huo Mian rolled her eyes. </p><p>Right after she replied, Huo Mian heard the sound of keys turning open the door.… </p><p>She stood up, put on slippers, and rushed to the door. She blocked Qin Chu at the door, \"I excavated this mountain, I planted this tree, if you want to get through, leave your money with me.\" </p><p>Qin Chu elegantly took off his jacket and looked at Huo Mian. \"I'm all yours. You can do what you want with me.\" </p><p>Huo Mian blushed immediately… </p><p>Qin Chu was taking advantage of her at every turn… </p><p>\"Dinner is ready.

Scary.\" Huo Mian felt reassured after hearing what Qin Chu said. </p><p>She tried it when she was cooking it and thought it was good. Although it was not as delicate as Lingling's dad's version, but the flavor was tasty enough… </p><p>Qin Chu had always been very picky about food, so she was actually worried that he would say it was bad or something. </p><p>But, her worrying was actually unnecessary to Qin Chu. </p><p>Even if Huo Mian made poison he would still say, \"Yes, it's good, really good.\" </p><p>As someone who was whipped, what negative words could you possibly get from him? </p><p>After a pleasant dinner, Qin Chu went to the kitchen to do dishes. </p><p>Huo Mian grabbed an apple to eat as she leisurely watched the shows on the music channel. </p><p>In the kitchen, Qin Chu's phone rang… </p><p>He rinsed off the bubbles on his hands and picked up his phone. </p><p>\"Hello?\" </p><p>\"Boss, lately someone has been looking for your current address and news about you and your wife. They even went to your high school to look for things from all those years ago. I don't know what they're after..\" </p><p>\"Stop them.\" </p><p>\"Yes, Boss.\" </p><p>After hanging up the phone, Qin Chu's eyes sunk into deep thought…</p><p>Huo Mian worked at South Side and he didn't get involved in her work too much, nor did he put someone on the inside.</p><p>He trusted his wife, 120%.</p><p>But lately, someone had been privately investigating Huo Mian's address and things that happened when they were at school. </p><p>This concerned him… </p><p>The good thing was that the Imperial Park had good privacy and he bought the apartment under Huo Mian's name. Moreover, the title had been tampered with at the Real Estate Bureau and was hidden. Normal people wouldn't be able to find it. </p><p>Besides, if someone was following Huo Mian, their trail would end there because Qin Chu had done some cleaning up inside the Imperial Park. </p><p>He did that to mislead his parents. He was afraid that they would come and give Huo Mian a hard time. </p><p>Now, it seemed like there were other people interested in Huo Mian's private life… </p><p>\"Mr. Qin, are you ready? Come and watch, Rene Liu is singing.\" </p><p>Huo Mian's voice sounded from the living room… </p><p>Qin Chu organized the dishes, came out of the kitchen and sat next to Huo Mian. </p><p>Rene Liu's beautiful voice came forth… </p><p>\"Isn't this song beautiful?\" Huo Mian asked intimately as she put her arms around Qin Chu's. </p><p>\"Yes it is.\" </p><p>\" It Happens That You Are Also Here , I have liked this song for many years, and every time I hear it, my heart throbs.\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't say anything else as he let Huo Mian's head lean on his shoulder and enjoyed the beautiful time that belonged to the two of them. </p><p>Actually, he didn't really like her songs nor did he know who Rene Liu was. </p><p>He only knew that if Huo Mian liked it, he must like it. </p><p>If Huo Mian was happy, he would be happy… </p><p>Love me, love my dog. It was as simple as that… </p><p>Although Huo Mian didn't need Qin Chu to give her a ride to work after she got her car back, he still insisted on dropping her off at the intersection. </p><p>Then, they would go different ways to work, living a busy but fulfilling day. </p><p>- At the headquarters of Imperial Star Entertainment - </p><p>Su Yu rarely came to the office headquarters.

Those who came were all upper-class heirs and socialites.</p><p>Here, it was completely normal to spend a few hundred thousand yuan in one night.</p><p>Ever since Zhu Lingling began dating that second-generation heir, Deng Kai, she often joined him on his adventures around town.</p><p>However, Zhu Lingling didn't like Deng Kai's social circle, as she thought it was too complicated. The lives of rich people were not as simple as that of ordinary people.</p><p>Their lives were often messy and unspeakable; truth to be told, Zhu Lingling didn't like Deng Kai that much. She thought that he was generous and treated her well, so she was fine with dating him for the moment. She was never going to marry him.</p><p>After Zhu Lingling got off work, she planned on crashing at home, but Deng Kai called her three times, asking her to meet him at Seductive Fox.</p><p>Zhu Lingling wore a simple black trench coat paired with jean shorts and black heels.</p><p>As a flight attendant, she was not only good looking but also had a stunning body. That's also why this heir of a rich family fell for her.</p><p>\"Lingling, come here.\" Deng Kai gestured at her.</p><p>Zhu Lingling walked over at sat down by Deng Kai…</p><p>\"Here, let me introduce Zhou Guangming, Young Master Zhou, to you. He's the heir of Tian Fu Mining.\" He pointed at the man beside him; he had a pointy mouth and monkey-like face.</p><p>Zhu Lingling nodded and greeted him, \"Young Master Zhou.\"</p><p>However, what she was actually thinking was, His dad owns no more than a mining company, why did Deng Kai have to especially introduce me to him?</p><p>\"Lingling, today's your lucky day, do you know who's coming?\" Deng Kai asked her mysteriously.</p><p>Zhu Lingling shook her head…</p><p>\"Young Master Su is coming in a bit.\"</p><p>\"Su Yu?\" Zhu Lingling was surprised.</p><p>\"Yeah, Young Master Zhou and Young Master Su know each other, and it's his birthday today so he invited Young Master Su. He will be coming with Young Master Wei in a bit. You can take a photo and upload it to your WeChat friend circle. Haha, your friends will be so jealous.\"</p><p>The truth was, although Deng Kai was a second-generation heir, he was nothing compared to Su Yu and the others.</p><p>This was his first time seeing Su Yu in person, so he was even more excited than Zhu Lingling…</p><p>\"I look forward to it.\" Zhu Lingling was quite curious, because she had heard a lot of rumors about Su Yu.</p><p>Zhou Guangming pervertedly looked at Zhu Lingling and smiled, \"You are indeed flight attendant material. You are pretty, have fair skin and long sexy legs.\"</p><p>The compliment was so explicit that it made Zhu Lingling uncomfortable. She smiled awkwardly without saying anything.</p><p>As they sat there, Zhou Guangming kept on asking her to drink. Zhu Lingling's tolerance wasn't bad, so, to be polite, she drank three glasses with him.</p><p>Deng Kai, on the other hand, was playing dice with a couple of friends and completely forgot that Zhu Lingling was there.</p><p>Bored, Zhu Lingling sat in a corner and took out her phone. She sent Huo Mian a WeChat message.</p><p>\"Girl, I'm at Seductive Fox, do you know who's coming later?\"</p><p>\"Who?\" Huo Mian asked.</p><p>\"Su Yu, I heard Su Yu's coming in a bit, haha. I'm nervous, but will remember to snatch a photo of him for you.\"</p><p>\"No thanks, I'm not interested in Su Yu.\" Huo Mian used to look at that dude's face every day at the hospital so naturally, she wasn't interested.</p><p>Just then, Zhou Guangming shuffled up to her with a wine glass in hand, \"Hey, sexy angel, do you want to play dice?\"</p><p>\"I don't really know how to.\"</p><p>\"I can teach you.\" Then, Zhou Guangming placed his hand on Zhu Lingling smooth thigh.</p><p>Zhu Lingling immediately got up and smiled, \"I'm sorry, but I need to go to the restroom.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling was just about to head to the restroom when the door to the private room opened…</p><p>Everyone in the room got up at once. \"Young Master Su.\"</p><p>It was an incredibly spectacular scene… Curious, Zhu Lingling's gaze stopped at the door.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":305,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:23.08","Link":"Chapter-305","NameDisplay":"Chapter 305"},{"ID":181120950237332577,"Name":"Chapter 306: This Woman Is Too Capricious (13)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 306: This Woman Is Too Capricious (13)","Description":"<p>Chapter 306: This Woman Is Too Capricious (13)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>The man by the door of the private room was dressed in beige sportswear with a low V-neck shirt. His pecs were partly hidden but still obvious under the cloth, making him look incredibly sexy.</p><p>Zhu Lingling, a fan of luxury goods, immediately noticed the brand of his outfit; it was the top-tier luxurious brand, Valentino.</p><p>His outfit was also limited edition, worth at least a hundred thousand yuan… (TL note: this guy is literally wearing my car and my condo's downpayment)</p><p>Zhu Lingling was shocked…</p><p>In comparison, her boyfriend, Deng Kai's Armani outfit, being worth a couple thousand, was pathetic. (TL note: wait, then what about my H&M and American Eagle)</p><p>Then, Zhu Lingling's gaze fell on Su Yu's face; his eyes were just the right size, he had inner-double eyelids and delicate features.</p><p>She couldn't help but stare at his red lips and white teeth; was this handsome man the legendary Su Yu, known for his awful temper?</p><p>Su Yu came in with Wei Liao, Tang Chuan, and the others. They were all well-known heirs.</p><p>Four bodyguards in black followed in after them; it really was a spectacular scene…</p><p>The twenty or so people inside the private room all looked at Su Yu as if he were God.</p><p>Some went up to pour him wine, others went up to help him light up his cigarette...</p><p>Zhou Guangming put away his arrogant manners and rushed up with his head between his legs.</p><p>\"Young Master Su, it's such an honor for you to come.\"</p><p>Su Yu faintly looked around the room, as if he was not interested in anything that was happening…</p><p>He didn't know Zhou Guangming that well, so he didn't have to be polite. He was only there because he knew Zhou Guangming's brother-in-law, Shen Ao, pretty well. Therefore, Su Yu took the time to stop by his party.</p><p>Zhou Guangming almost emptied his wallet to order some of the most expensive liquors. He handed the drinks to Su Yu, Wei Liao, and the others…</p><p>Zhu Lingling was dumbfounded…</p><p>In her trance, she secretly took a photo of the group and sent it to Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Guess which one's Su Yu.\"</p><p>\"The idiot in beige.\"</p><p>\"Good job, Huo-lock Holmes.\" Zhu Lingling was impressed.</p><p>\"Girl, Su Yu stayed at our hospital for so long, so I can probably recognize him even if I were blind.\"</p><p>\"Haha, okay, I didn't think that Su Yu would be this good-looking, he looks like a Korean pop star. Gosh, I think I'm fangirling right now.\"</p><p>\"Forget it, he's not a good person, don't get your hopes up,\" Huo Mian advised.</p><p>\"Haha, don't worry, I'll just fangirl from afar. Ordinary girls like us can't handle men like Su Yu.\"</p><p>\"It's good that you know. It's late, you should go home soon. Don't stay too late.\"</p><p>Huo Mian didn't think it was safe for girls to stay too late at nightclubs. Therefore, she tried to talk Zhu Lingling into going home.</p><p>\"Don't worry about it. I'll go home with my boyfriend in a bit,\" Zhu Lingling replied.</p><p>Qin Chu was working overtime; he was still tied up at a conference in the neighboring city. Therefore, after Huo Mian replied to Zhu Lingling, she went back to sleep.</p><p>Zhu Lingling thought that once she and Deng Kai wished Mr. Zhou a happy birthday, they would be able to leave.</p><p>However, what happened next was completely out of her imagination, and impossible for her to deal with.</p><p>After Zhou Guangming blew out his birthday candles, the entire room went crazy, and all the girls took off their tops, showing their breasts…</p><p>It was too over-the-top and too much for Zhu Lingling.</p><p>Music blasted in the room, paired with the screams of men and women. Most of the men brought dates, and those who didn't were accompanied by the nightclub's escorts. It was chaotic.</p><p>Zhu Lingling liked nightclubs and being young and stupid, but she was a proper girl who knew what to do and what not to do.</p><p>Therefore, when she saw all this, she immediately felt repelled…</p><p>She went up and grabbed Deng Kai's hand. Just as she was about to ask him if they could leave, she saw Zhou Guangming walk up to them.</p><p>\"Deng Kai, what's with your girl, why is her top still on?\" Zhou Guangming stared at Zhu Lingling with a devilish smile.</p><p>\"Oh, she's a little shy and hasn't done stuff like this before.\" Deng Kai laughed dryly.</p><p>\"She'll get used to it.

Zhu Lingling immediately replied, \"No, I won't do it. I don't play games like this.\"</p><p>Deng Kai laughed dryly and looked at Zhou Guangming, \"She's nervous in public. Plus, she's from a poor family so she hasn't experienced life and doesn't how to have fun like we do. Don't take it personally, Young Master Zhou.\"</p><p>Truth be told, Deng Kai's words made Zhu Lingling really unhappy, but she didn't say anything.</p><p>She pretended that it was Deng Kai's attempt to give Zhou Guangming an out…</p><p>However, Zhou Guangming, unwilling to back down, handed her a glass of wine instead, \"Oh, really? But it's my birthday today, and I'm the boss. If you're not going to take off your shirt, then at least have a glass of wine with me.\"</p><p>Deng Kai looked at Zhu Lingling pleadingly, \"Lingling, just have some wine.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling thought that everything would be fine after she drank that glass of wine. Plus, Deng Kai was there, so nothing bad would happen to her.</p><p>Therefore, without precaution, she took the wine Zhou Guangming handed her and drank it all…</p><p>She didn't notice Zhou Guangming's evil smile…</p><p>Su Yu, not far away, was chit chatting with Wei Liao, not at all interested in anyone or anything in the room.</p><p>After she drank the wine, Zhu Lingling began to feel dizzy, and her heart began beating fast. Realizing that something was wrong, she immediately ran to the restroom. She picked at her throat, in hopes to throw up the wine.</p><p>Just then, a woman came in to do some touchup on her makeup. She laughed, \"Young Master Zhou drugged you. It seems like your boyfriend is basically giving you to Zhou Guangming to play with tonight. Too bad for you, there's no escape.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling looked up after hearing the voice. The woman talking to her was Huo Yanyan…</p><p>She knew Huo Yanyan, and vice versa. However, because of Huo Mian, Zhu Lingling despised her.</p><p>\"Why are you here?\" Zhu Lingling was surprised to see her.</p><p>She must've paid too much attention to Su Yu, so Zhu Lingling didn't even notice that one of the women in the private room was Huo Yanyan. No wonder she couldn't recognize her, Huo Yanyan had on smokey-eye makeup tonight, and looked like a panda.</p><p>Her dress was furry and colorful, and she looked like a retarded parrot.</p><p>When all of the girls took their clothes off, Huo Yanyan didn't; rather, she went to have a drink with Su Yu.</p><p>It was obvious that Su Yu wasn't interested, so she started playing dice with Wei Liao and Tang Chuan.</p><p>Wei Liao and the others didn't like Huo Yanyan as well, but since she was from the Huo family and was Huo Siqian's little sister, they had to be somewhat considerate of her.</p><p>This was probably the worst time to see Huo Yanyan…</p><p>Zhu Lingling kept throwing up, but she was still feeling dizzy…</p><p>\"I never have anything to say to people like you. Get out of my way.\" Zhu Lingling pushed Huo Yanyan off to the side and stumbled out to accidentally see something that instantly made her hopeless…</p><p>Zhou Guangming was talking to her supposed boyfriend. \"Deng Kai, I have a thing for your girl, let me borrow her for a night.\"</p><p>Deng Kai responded with a slight smile, \"Young Master Zhou, I don't think that's a good idea. I kind of like this girlfriend.\"</p><p>Zhou Guangming snickered. \"Women are like a change of clothes, they're not hard to come by. Don't be so stingy, I can lend you mine to play with. It'll be fun, she's half Chinese, half Russian, has an insanely hot body, and is super good in bed.\"</p><p>Deng Kai seemed to be considering the deal. \"Young Master Zhou, I…\"</p><p>Zhou Guangming caught onto his friend's change in stance quickly. \"It's a deal then. Once the drug starts to work, I'll take her to the lounge and have some fun with her.\"</p><p>Then, Zhou Guangming patted Deng Kai on the shoulder, to which Deng Kai didn't even object…</p><p>Zhu Lingling was so angry that she was about to burst. Deng Kai seemed really manly, but right then and there, why was he acting like such a p*ssy?</p><p>Does he not even have the guts to refuse? Did he just agree to let Zhou Guangming play with her for the night?</p><p>F*ck this bullsh*t…</p><p>Furious, Zhu Lingling stormed out and grabbed Deng Kai by the collar, \"Are you a f*cking man or not?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":307,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:24.377","Link":"Chapter-307","NameDisplay":"Chapter 307"},{"ID":181120950259489970,"Name":"Chapter 308: This Woman Is Too Capricious (15)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 308: This Woman Is Too Capricious (15)","Description":"<p>Chapter 308: This Woman Is Too Capricious (15)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Lingling, I can't piss off Young Master Zhou. Can you do this for me just for tonight…\"</p><p>As soon as he finished, Zhu Lingling slapped Deng Kai right across the face, and his cheek immediately flamed up.</p><p>Then, Zhu Lingling grabbed her bag to leave…</p><p>But she was stopped by Zhou Guangming's men.</p><p>\"What do you want?\"</p><p>\"Hey, pretty girl, you can't go, I haven't had my fun yet,\" Zhou Guangming smiled and replied.</p><p>\"Have fun my a*s, get the f*ck away from me, I'm going home.\" Zhu Lingling's head was spinning, and she wanted to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>\"You're spicy. But that's okay, I like little spicy girls. We're gonna have a lot of fun.\" Zhou Guangming said as he reached out to pinch Zhu Lingling's face.</p><p>Zhu Lingling stepped back and almost fell to the ground. Nervous and anxious, she sent Huo Mian a WeChat voice message, \"Come get me, I'm at Seductive Fox, room 808. Come with your husband, quickly.\"</p><p>The only thought that crossed Zhu Lingling's mind was that Huo Mian was the only one who could help her. Of course, she wasn't capable of rescuing Zhu Lingling herself.</p><p>She was afraid that Huo Mian would be stepping into a bear trap, so she reminded Huo Mian to bring Qin Chu with her.</p><p>However, little did she know that Qin Chu was on a business trip at a neighboring city and wasn't home yet.</p><p>After Huo Mian received the message, she noticed that Lingling sounded weird. She immediately dialed her number but no one picked up.</p><p>At this moment, she realized that something must be wrong, so she threw on some clothes right away and drove to Seductive Fox.</p><p>It was in the middle of the night, and there weren't a lot of cars on the road. It only took Huo Mian 12 minutes to get there.</p><p>This was the first time she drove this fast, and she didn't even know how fast she was going.</p><p>\"Miss, are you here alone?\" the greeter by the door asked politely.</p><p>\"No, I'm here to pick up a friend,\" Huo Mian hurriedly said, and then she took the elevator straight to the 8th floor.</p><p>As soon as she pushed open the doors of the private room, everyone's gaze turned to her…</p><p>She was wearing black loose pants, a white t-shirt, and a black long vest.</p><p>It was a simple black and white combination, but pretty all the same. Her clothes matched her beautiful face perfectly and highlighted her elegant disposition.</p><p>\"Lingling,\" she anxiously cried out.</p><p>Then, she saw Zhu Lingling, in the arms of a man, her clothes all over the place.</p><p>That pointy-faced monkey-looking man was just about to put his hands on her, which completely pissed Huo Mian off…</p><p>Zhu Lingling seemed to be already semi-conscious; she didn't even react when she saw Huo Mian.</p><p>As a professional healthcare provider, she immediately realized that Lingling had been drugged.</p><p>\"Hey, who's this pretty girl? I like her temperament.\" Zhou Guangming looked at Huo Mian pervertedly.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't respond. She looked around the room full of men and women and asked, \"Who's Deng Kai.\"</p><p>She knew that Deng Kai brought Lingling here, or else she would never come to a high-end club like Seductive Fox on her own.</p><p>However, if her boyfriend brought her here, why was she drugged and being harassed by another man?</p><p>This was unacceptable…</p><p>\"I'm Deng Kai, who are you?\" Deng Kai was having fun with the Chinese-Russian girl when he heard someone call out his name. He immediately stood up.</p><p>Huo Mian walked up to Deng Kai and, without saying anything, slapped him right across the face.</p><p>The slap was loud and crisp, shocking everyone in the room…</p><p>\"Tsk tsk… who's that little hot pepper? She's got a temper,\" the rich heirs discussed amongst themselves.</p><p>\"Who the f*ck are you, why did you hit me?\" Deng Kai was dumbfounded by the slap and looked at Huo Mian angrily.</p><p>\"I can't believe that you, Lingling's boyfriend, would take her to a place like this. Not only did you fail to take care of her, but you also managed to get her drugged and almost raped by another man! Tell me, did your mom lose you when you were born, and raised only the placenta instead?\"</p><p>After Huo Mian finished cursing at him, people immediately started laughing…</p><p>It was rare to hear a young woman curse so comically; she was one of a kind.</p><p>Wei Liao narrowed his eyes at Huo Mian, and asked Su Yu on purpose, \"This girl looks familiar, isn't she the one you've been hung up on?\"</p><p>Su Yu didn't reply, but ever since Huo Mian entered the private room, his gaze never left her…</p><p>He had to admit that every time he saw Huo Mian, his heart would begin beating rapidly… It was an interesting feeling.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":308,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:25.95","Link":"Chapter-308","NameDisplay":"Chapter 308"},{"ID":181120950265546764,"Name":"Chapter 309: A Little Too Much Fun (1)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 309: A Little Too Much Fun (1)","Description":"<p>Chapter 309: A Little Too Much Fun (1)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Where the hell did this crazy b*tch come from, is she retarded?\" First slapped and then cursed at, Deng Kai was flabbergasted.</p><p>He had too much alcohol and too much fun and had completely forgotten that Zhu Lingling often mentioned to him that her best friend's name was Huo Mian.</p><p>Therefore, he had absolutely no idea who Huo Mian was…</p><p>Then, Huo Mian ignored everyone around them and walked straight up to Zhou Guangming. She pulled Zhu Lingling, half-conscious, away from Zhou Guangming's embrace.</p><p>\"Lingling, let's go.\"</p><p>\"Wait.\" Zhou Guangming's face immediately went grim.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't stop; she headed for the door but was blocked by Zhou Guangming's people.</p><p>\"Are you crazy, taking people from my arms? Do you think I'm blind?\" Zhou Guangming was in the middle of having the time of his life when this girl came in and ruined everything. Of course he was pissed off.</p><p>\"Lingling is my best friend, she asked me to come to pick her up, so I'm picking her up. It's as simple as that.\"</p><p>\"Haha, kudos for being so arrogant. Did you think this place was a supermarket, and you can just come and go as you wish?\"</p><p>Zhou Guangming sneered as he slowly stood up from the couch…</p><p>He thought that it would be a piece of cake, dealing with lowlifes like her.</p><p>He especially liked to toy with weak girls, and he loved playing cat and mouse…</p><p>Just then, Huo Yanyan suddenly walked up; she rested her hand on Zhou Guangming's shoulder and said, \"Young Master Zhou, you're a lucky man, I foresee a threesome tonight~\"</p><p>\"A threesome? Hahaha, that's a good idea, you're a smart girl.\" Zhou Guangming, enlightened by Huo Yanyan, suddenly had an awakening.</p><p>Huo Mian coldly glanced at Huo Yanyan, \"You seem to know a lot about it, I assumed you've tried it before?\"</p><p>\"Of course not, I'm an upper-class socialite from a good family. Unlike you, you little lowlife. You won't even sell for a high price.\"</p><p>\"Hey, Miss Huo, do you two know each other?\" Zhou Guangming obviously noticed something going on between them.</p><p>To his surprise, both Huo Mian and Huo Yanyan answered his question at the same time, \"No.\"</p><p>\"Haha, that's good then. Hey, pretty girl, you definitely won't be able to leave tonight, so… why don't you stay here and have some fun? Or you can leave, but your good friend will have to stay. What do you think?\"</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, was extremely calm. She tightened her grip around Zhu Lingling's waist, stared at Zhou Guangming and said, word for word, \"You seem to look like a human being, but I don't think you're speaking our language. People like you are a waste of oxygen when alive, and a waste of land when dead.\"</p><p>Wei Liao, watching from the side, couldn't help but burst into laughter…</p><p>\"She's hilarious, even her curses are unique. I can't believe she just said that with a straight face, no wonder you like her.\"</p><p>\"She has always been like that,\" Su Yu said as he stared at Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Go ahead, curse me all you want. I'll get back at you later in bed, hahaha.\" Zhou Guangming laughed dirtily.</p><p>He thought that it would be impossible for a weak woman like Huo Mian, with no background, no one to rely on, and no experience in fighting, to leave a room with more than 20 people. She could dream all she wanted, but it was not going to happen.</p><p>To him, Huo Mian and Zhu Lingling were already carved turkeys, plated and ready for him to enjoy.</p><p>\"I don't believe that will happen. The more you try to stop me from leaving, the more determined I am about leaving. Let's see, who wants to stop me?\" Huo Mian scanned the room with an icy expression.</p><p>When she glanced past Su Yu, her face remained emotionless, as if she was just looking at a stranger. This was because Zhu Lingling had already told her that Su Yu was there as well, so there was nothing to be surprised about.</p><p>Interested at what was happening, Wei Liao looked at Su Yu, \"Isn't it time for you go and enter the scene and save the princess?

Instead, he stared at Huo Mian's beautiful face, his eyes deep with thought. Yet, no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>Huo Mian left home in a rush, and the winds were pretty strong tonight, so she only wore a casual outfit.</p><p>Black and white were such boring colors, yet the outfit looked like that of a socialite on her. He had to admit that not everyone had Huo Mian's aura.</p><p>Her hair was tied up in a simple ponytail, which made her look young and cute.</p><p>Her outfit was indeed boring, but since it was an emergency, she randomly threw some clothes on wasn't even thinking about how she looked.</p><p>However, Su Yu loved looking at her…</p><p>He thought that Huo Mian looked especially pretty tonight…</p><p>In reality, it was because Su Yu fell for her, so even if Huo Mian came in wearing a garbage bag, he would still find her pretty.</p><p>That's the beauty of the saying, 'love is blind'.</p><p>\"Little girl, stop fighting it.

Huo Mian was disgusted.</p><p>If she wasn't carrying Zhu Lingling, she would've kicked that gross a*shole to the curb.</p><p>He was just nauseating to her.</p><p>If someone like him was admitted to South Side, she would poke him with a needle until he became disabled, no mercy given.</p><p>\"You can't do anything to me.

It was not worth getting scared over.</p><p>Rather, it sparked his urge to conquer.</p><p>Then, Zhou Guangming took off his t-shirt, revealing his upper body.</p><p>\"Hey, Young Master Zhou's gonna have some fun now,\" someone in the crowd cheered him on.</p><p>Then, some began to clap, while others whistled. It was as if they are at the zoo, watching monkeys.</p><p>Huo Mian despised this; she already had a plan in mind and wanted to quickly end this standoff.</p><p>Wei Liao began losing his cool because he noticed that Su Yu had no intention of interfering.</p><p>That wasn't right.</p><p>Wasn't this the perfect time to come out and save the princess? Then, wasn't the princess supposed to express her gratitude and then fall in love with him?</p><p>Weren't TV scripts all written that way?</p><p>Finally, Wei Liao couldn't help but remind him, \"Su Yu, aren't you going to go help her? Soon it'll be too late; Zhou Guangming's way of playing with girls is brutal, can you stand the girl you like being treated that way?\"</p><p>Su Yu glanced coldly at Wei Liao and replied with question of his own, \"If you're that anxious, why don't you save her?\"</p><p>Wei Liao didn't know what to say.</p><p>The truth was, Su Yu did want to help her, but he was waiting for the right time.</p><p>He wanted to wait until Huo Mian asked for his help; he wasn't about to run over and help her before she even opened her mouth.</p><p>That wasn't Su Yu's style…</p><p>All he wanted was some kind of signal from Huo Mian, as little as a glance his way; then, he would gladly punish that pervert Zhou Guangming.</p><p>Sadly, Huo Mian was super calm, and she had absolutely no intention of signaling for help.</p><p>When she glanced around the room and saw him, she looked at him like he was a stranger to her; her eyes didn't even linger on him.</p><p>Su Yu was aware of Huo Mian's guts, but he was surprised at how cocky she was being at a time like this.</p><p>She peaked his interest; he wanted to know how Huo Mian, a girl on her own, was going to escape from a pack of wolves.</p><p>After Zhou Guangming took off his top, he closed in on Huo Mian.</p><p>A perverted smile appeared on his face. \"Little girl, come to daddy.\"</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, smiled faintly…</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":310,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:27.01","Link":"Chapter-310","NameDisplay":"Chapter 310"},{"ID":181120950275902969,"Name":"Chapter 311: A Little Too Much Fun (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 311: A Little Too Much Fun (3)","Description":"<p>Chapter 311: A Little Too Much Fun (3)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Everyone was watching, and that little b*tch Huo Yanyan even took out her phone and began recording, waiting for Huo Mian to make a fool out of herself.</p><p>In a split second, Huo Mian pushed Zhu Lingling onto a couch by the side… she then walked towards Zhou Guangming.</p><p>Dumbfounded, Zhou Guangming was shocked for a brief moment seeing this girl actually walking towards him.</p><p>Just before his brain could process the situation, Huo Mian reached out and grabbed his arms, twisting them to his back.</p><p>After two loud cracks, both of his arms were completely dislocated… and a painful scream echoed through the entire private room…</p><p>Just when his men haven't even had a chance react to what was happening, Huo Mian quickly picked up a beer bottle from the table and hurled it at Zhou Guangming's head. Some of the girls began shrieking in horror.</p><p>Finally, just when everyone thought that it was over, Huo Mian picked up the broken bottle and pressed it against Zhou Guangming's neck.</p><p>The bottle had been smashed and was sharper than a razor.

Let go of me,\" Zhou Guangming's arms had been dislocated, and he cried out in pain.</p><p>Feeling the broken beer bottle pressed against his neck, he was so scared that his face went pale.</p><p>\"If you want him to live, move away. I'm taking my friend home.\" Huo Mian still kept her cool.</p><p>Her face was calm and emotionless… as if everything was going according to plan.</p><p>Of course, these stupid people didn't have the chance to react. She had turned the situation around within a matter of seconds; no one aside from Huo Mian was capable of something like this.</p><p>\"Why are you all just standing there? Get over here and kill this b*tch,\" Zhou Guangming sucked in his pain and cursed at his people.</p><p>\"Big Brother Zhou…\" The men finally came to their senses, and they closed in onto Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Don't come near, or else he's dead.\" Huo Mian pressed the beer bottle even harder onto Zhou Guangming's neck.</p><p>The sharp glass immediately penetrated his skin, and he howled in pain.</p><p>\"Oh sh*t it hurts, don't come near! Back… back the f*ck off!\"</p><p>Zhou Guangming finally realized that this woman wasn't bluffing; she was for real.</p><p>Just then, Huo Yanyan opened her mouth, \"Get her friend and threaten her. A life for a life, then she'll have to throw in the towel.\"</p><p>Huo Yanyan was a tad smarter than Zhou Guangming and his men… she gave them an idea when they needed one the most…</p><p>Zhou Guangming's men listened to Huo Yanyan, and one of them immediately grabbed Zhu Lingling.</p><p>After all, Huo Mian was by herself.

Let's see if my friend stops breathing first, or your Big Brother Zhou.\"</p><p>\"You…\" The men were all dumbfounded.</p><p>They were shocked at how unreasonable this woman was; she wasn't interested in compromising at all.</p><p>Then, Huo Mian added, \"Don't drop my friend.

At worse, I'll pay for it in prison. But here's the thing – Lingling and I are just ordinary citizens with nothing special. I heard that your Big Brother Zhou here is a super-rich heir, and he has so much money, he can burn it just for fun. Tsk tsk… it'll be a shame if he dies young…\"</p><p>After Huo Mian finished her sentence, the men backed away, unwilling to advance any further.</p><p>\"Hey little girl, let's talk things out, this is too dangerous. Why don't you let me go first? Then, I'll ask my men to escort the two of you out, what do you think?\"</p><p>Zhou Guangming's legs went weak upon hearing what Huo Mian said…</p><p>His rage had burned out, and all he cared about now was keeping himself alive.</p><p>Huo Mian was right; he was so rich, it wouldn't be worth it to die over something like this.</p><p>What was the point of fighting with two women anyways?</p><p>\"I'm not a little kid, and I'm not about to negotiate with you. Either you let me go now, or we both die here. My patience is running out, so you'd better make your decision soon. Or else, I have no choice but to start draining your blood.\"</p><p>Then, she lightly scraped the broken beer bottle on his neck, and blood immediately began flowing out…</p><p>The truth was, she didn't use a lot of strength. It was just an exterior wound; as a medical professional, she knew more than anyone how to control bleeding.</p><p>However, in the others' eyes, she was acting like a maniac…</p><p>\"Sh*t, is she really going to drain Big Brother Zhou of his blood?\"</p><p>\"There's so much blood! Holy f*ck, should we call the police?\"</p><p>Everyone inside the private room lost their cool and sank into chaos… things have officially gone a little too far.</p><p>Second-generation heirs like them only knew of booze and fun; none of them had ever witnessed a scene as bloody as this one.</p><p>\"Hurry up, let them go! Make way! This woman has gone mad!\"</p><p>Zhou Guangming felt a chill on his neck as sticky blood flowed out of it. At that moment, all of his rationality disappeared as he completely broke down.</p><p>At that same moment, Su Yu couldn't help but look at Huo Mian with admiration.</p><p>Yes, he was impressed by how calm and collected she stayed when faced with danger, capable of controlling the situation and dealing with the enemy.</p><p>She easily destroyed Zhou Guangming's sanity and took control of the scene.</p><p>It was a shame that she was born in modern times; if she were born a couple hundred years ago, she would make a fine military commander…</p><p>She had the potential to lead men into war…</p><p>She had fast reflexes and tackled matters accurately and ruthlessly. She didn't say much, but her actions spoke louder than a million words…</p><p>At that moment, all the men seemed like nobodies under her aura…</p><p>\"Don't let her go, don't worry, nothing bad is going to happen,\" Huo Yanyan shrieked loudly.</p><p>People just ignored her; at this point, everyone believed that Huo Mian was for real.</p><p>If they kept this going, someone was really going to die...</p><p>\"F*ck, what are you all standing there for? Let her go…\" In the end, Zhou Guangming wailed out in tears, in fear that he was really going to bleed to death.</p><p>\"Come one, guys, let her go. Open the door.\"</p><p>Someone called out from the crowd, and everyone slowly dispersed. Then, someone opened the door.</p><p>Huo Mian continued to tug on Zhou Guangming's collar with one hand and press the beer bottle against his neck with the other, unwilling to budge.</p><p>\"You, help my friend up and come downstairs with me.

(TL: Lol, why do I feel like it was Tang Chuan and Wei Liao doing it for fun)</p><p>Apparently, he liked weird stuff that was out of place, because it felt like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>Therefore, Huo Yanyan spent a fortune on a stylist, so that she could copy off the mother of visual experimentation, Lady Gaga.</p><p>However, she was just blindly imitating her, because Lady Gaga's style had always been that way. However, her dressing up like that all of a sudden was way over-the-top.</p><p>Why did a woman like that have to ruin herself …</p><p>No wonder Huo Siqian once labeled Huo Yanyan as 'a brainless oaf with big breasts'.</p><p>\"F*ck off.\" Su Yu relentlessly reached out and pushed Huo Yanyan off to the side.</p><p>Just now, Huo Yanyan was egging Zhou Guangming on; Su Yu hadn't even made her pay for what she did yet.</p><p>Thank goodness Huo Mian was alright; if she was hurt because of Huo Yanyan, Su Yu would immediately cut off her tongue.</p><p>That big-mouthed woman…</p><p>After Su Yu pushed Huo Yanyan aside, he got into his black Lamborghini.</p><p>Wei Liao got onto the passenger seat.</p><p>\"Where are we going now? To find your girl?\" Wei Liao smiled.</p><p>Su Yu didn't answer; instead, he stepped on the gas pedal, and the car sped away with a 'swoosh'.</p><p>\"Ahhhhh!!\"</p><p>The speed scared Wei Liao…</p><p>He knew what Su Yu was thinking about; however, he couldn't tell for sure, because Su Yu was a fickle man.</p><p>Huo Mian drove her car all the way to Lingling's parents' home. She wanted to drop Lingling off at Lingling's own apartment but was afraid that those people would come looking for revenge.</p><p>After all, Lingling's asshole boyfriend knew where she lived…</p><p>When they passed by a pharmacy, she bought some hangover medicine and fed it to Lingling.</p><p>When she dropped her off at her parents', all Huo Mian said was that Lingling was drunk.</p><p>Her parents were aware that Huo Mian and Zhu Lingling were good friends, so they didn't suspect a thing.</p><p>Huo Mian watched Zhu Lingling for a while, and she didn't leave until she was sure that Lingling was asleep and stable.</p><p>On her way back home, she was careful; she knew that those people weren't easy to deal with, and it was possible for them to tail her in the middle of the night to seek revenge. Things seemed to be peaceful, but the more peaceful they were, the more worried she became.</p><p>Truth be told, she was extremely nervous just now. Thank goodness Zhou Guangming admitted defeat; or else, was she really going to be forced to kill him?</p><p>Of course not, she wasn't that stupid. She didn't want to receive a death penalty for murder. All she thought was that when things came to it, Su Yu wasn't going to just stand there and do nothing, right?</p><p>However, if she could, she wanted to deal with things herself.

He's acting a little weird today.\"</p><p>Although she wondered why he acted that way, she didn't think too much into it. There was no way Huo Mian was going to tell Qin Chu about what happened just now.</p><p>If Qin Chu found out that she stood up against more than 20 men and almost got hurt, he would go crazy. She knew how much Qin Chu cared about her personal safety.</p><p>The sky-high insurance that Qin Chu bought her was proof of how much he cared.</p><p>Therefore, Huo Mian took a shower and crawled into bed…</p><p>She waited a long time, but Qin Chu didn't come; in the end, she fell asleep alone.</p><p>- Inside the study -</p><p>Qin Chu stared at his laptop, but he had no intention to work.</p><p>He was at a neighboring city, ready for an all-night emergency meeting.</p><p>GK had made property investments in that city, but the local government implemented new policies, so they had to make adjustments.</p><p>In order to not waste the billions they had invested, Qin Chu had no choice but to inspect the construction site in person.</p><p>Then, he brought along some executives and engineers to attend the all-night meeting.</p><p>However, at around midnight, someone sent him a video…</p><p>The video was from Rick; they were friends but rarely hung out.</p><p>Usually, unless it was absolutely necessary, Rick rarely contacted Qin Chu, because both of their statuses in society were too special.</p><p>Moreover, no one knew that when Qin Chu lived in the United States, he and Rick, and even Rick's family, were abnormally close.</p><p>After he returned to China, Qin Chu only asked Rick for one favor, and that was to investigate the truck that almost hit Huo Mian.</p><p>Therefore, Rick would never send a video to him out of boredom…</p><p>Qin Chu waved his hand, signaling them to stop the meeting. Then, he walked into the lounge and opened the video.</p><p>After watching it, his entire face fell…</p><p>The Seductive Fox Nightclub was one of Rick's family's businesses, and cameras were installed in every corner of the club.</p><p>Therefore, from Huo Mian's entrance to her exit, Qin Chu saw everything, bright and clear.</p><p>Below the video, Rick added, \"I heard that you're not in the city, but don't worry, I promise that nothing will happen to her.\"</p><p>What he meant was, Rick was going to make sure Huo Mian left the club safely. However, she managed to escape herself.</p><p>Although what she did was risky, it was still impressive…</p><p>Huo Mian probably didn't know, but someone was actually secretly protecting her when she was at Seductive Fox doing her thing.</p><p>After Qin Chu saw what Huo Mian did, he lost his cool…</p><p>He was not in the mood to continue with the meeting, so he drove home and waited for Huo Mian to confess and apologize. </p><p>He had already warned her not to do anything stupid, but she kept putting herself behind enemy lines…</p><p>What if the nightclub didn't belong to Rick? What if the men she faced were outlaws?</p><p>Would Huo Mian have walked out alive? He didn't even want to think about it.</p><p>However, after he got home and interrogated Huo Mian, she played dumb with him and didn't even mention what happened.</p><p>Did he not even have the right to worry about her? Weren't married couples supposed to tell each other everything?</p><p>This was the first time Qin Chu felt as mad as he did…</p><p>He was more furious than ever, so he ignored Huo Mian and went up to his study room alone.</p><p>He didn't go back to her room all night.</p><p>- The next morning -</p><p>After Huo Mian got up, she didn't see breakfast on the table, nor Qin Chu in the condo.</p><p>She sent him a WeChat message, \"Did you go to work?\"</p><p>She waited a while, but no one replied.

He was a real coward, selling her out during a critical moment like that.</p><p>Because of him, she was almost raped by that Zhou guy; thank goodness Huo Mian arrived on time. </p><p>As for what happened last night, Huo Mian didn't want to say much, because she didn't want Zhu Lingling to feel bad. </p><p>Sometimes, it's best to just let the past slide. Nothing happened, and that was obviously the best outcome already. </p><p>Huo Mian went back to work after hanging up the phone... </p><p>Huo Mian's incident from last night was quietly spreading like wildfire in the upper-class circle. Many of them wanted to take a look at the glorious tough girl. </p><p>More than anything, they wanted to see bloodshed. </p><p>Rumors had it that Zhou Guangming was already recovering in the First Hospital's VIP room. Not only was his family taking turns watching him, but he also hired a bunch of bodyguards. </p><p>He was almost scared to death by a woman, for real this time. </p><p>Huang Yue had always been a gossipy nurse. While on lunch, she secretly messaged Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Mian, you there?\" </p><p>\"What's up?\" </p><p>\"A special guest was admitted into one of our VIP rooms today, apparently he's some mining company's heir.\" </p><p>\"Okay,\" Huo Mian replied calmly. </p><p>\"Do you know why he's here?\" </p><p>\"Nope.\" </p><p>\"Haha, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. He got drunk last night and was going to rape some girl, but then he met this girl that was a highly trained Kung Fu master. She was so agile and beat the shit out him. Not only did she dislocate his arms, she almost slashed his throat! I wonder where this girl came from, she has such a temper! I really want to meet her, she's my idol now.\" </p><p>\"Ahem… where did you hear all of this crap?\" Huo Mian was sipping on water and almost choked. </p><p>A highly trained Kung Fu Master? Throat slashing? Was it really that intense? </p><p>\"I'm not bullsh*ting you! It's real! That second-generation heir was so scared! Now that he's in the hospital, he placed eight bodyguards in front of the door. I wonder how psychologically scarred he is.\" </p><p>\"Hm… so were his injuries serious?\" Huo Mian wondered if he would sue her if she injured him more than she intended. </p><p>\"Nah. It's all just scratches and bruises, we've reattached his arm. However, he's a little traumatized. I heard that he's now suffering from insomnia. He went to the Neurology Department and asked to be tranquilized.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I see.\" Huo Mian let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>After hearing the bastard was indeed alright, she felt a little reassured. It was a good thing that the guy was admitted to the First Hospital. </p><p>If he came to South Side, would he pass out and froth around the mouth when he saw that Huo Mian was a nurse here? </p><p>After all, Huo Mian left a very deep, nightmare-like impression on him last night. </p><p>- Headquarters of the Huo Corporation -</p><p>\"So… my little sister Mian almost blew up Earth again last night?\" Huo Siqian smiled profoundly as he played with a mini globe and listened to his man report to him the events of the night before.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":315,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:29.57","Link":"Chapter-315","NameDisplay":"Chapter 315"},{"ID":181120950301329142,"Name":"Chapter 316: A Little Too Much Fun (8)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 316: A Little Too Much Fun (8)","Description":"<p>Chapter 316: A Little Too Much Fun (8)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"President Huo, that's all I have to report.\" </p><p>\"Very well. It's fortunate that Mian is alright, or else Zhou Guangming would be in the crematory right now, not the First Hospital.\" </p><p>\"We will keep a close watch on Miss Huo Mian. Don't worry, President Huo, we will make sure nothing else happens to her.\" </p><p>\"Good work, you may go now.\" </p><p>After chasing out his men, Huo Siqian was thinking of giving Mian a call. However, he was interrupted by Huo Siyi, who suddenly burst into the room. </p><p>\"Big Brother...?\" </p><p>\"What is it?\" Huo Siqian looked up. </p><p>\"I don't want to work on the project in England anymore.\" Huo Siyi didn't like Huo Siqian very much, but on the surface, he needed to show his respect to his older brother. </p><p>\"Why? Isn't it going well? I've been saying good things about you in front of Dad.\" </p><p>\"It's always raining in England. The weather there sucks, and it affects my mood. I also have no friends there, and I have no place to have fun. I'm bored to death. \" </p><p>\"Dad said you're all grown up now, you shouldn't always be thinking about going out and having fun. You should help me out a little when it comes to work.\" </p><p>\"I can help you out here, in the country. I just don't want to go abroad anymore! Just stop sending me overseas, I won't be going. I will tell Dad myself.\" Huo Siyi walked out before Huo Siqian could say anything. </p><p>\"Tsk tsk... Look at the spoiled brat.\" Huo Siqian shook his head and sighed. </p><p>He was no longer in a hurry to get rid of Huo Siqian and Huo Yanyan anymore, because they were no longer a threat. </p><p>The only threat was the old guy who won't die, and his… mistress. </p><p>- Dinner time - </p><p>Huo Siqian sat beside Huo Zhenghai in the dining room of their mansion. Huo Siqian would often pour drinks and make sure his father's bowl was buried in a mountain of food. He was indeed very good at putting up a front as a dutiful and obedient son. </p><p>Huo Siyi and Huo Yanyan, on the other hand, often went out, so they very rarely ate dinner at home. Dinner time was also only attended by Shen Jiani and Jiang Hong. </p><p>\"Dad, I have some news.\" </p><p>\"What is it?\" Huo Zhenghai seemed rather interested. </p><p>\"I heard Su Yu has taken an interest in Mian.\"</p><p>\"Su Yu? The only young master from the Su family? The only heir of the Su Family after five generations?\" When it comes to the Su family, even Huo Zhenghai was in awe of their reputation. </p><p>Rumor had it that in C City, the Su surname entitled you to do whatever you liked. </p><p>The Su household was a family with a deep history. Back in the National Period of China (1912-1945), they were a family of extreme power. Many of their family members worked as either rich businessmen or high-level officials. </p><p>Their positions were already deeply rooted in Mainland China and could not be easily shaken. </p><p>As the only child of the fifth generation in the Su household, Su Yu was blessed by God the moment he was born. </p><p>\"Yes, that's the one.\" </p><p>\"How can he possibly be interested in Huo Mian?\"</p><p>Huo Zhenghai was surprised. That unfavorable daughter of his didn't possess a beautiful face, nor a curvy body. </p><p>She wasn't tender nor soft, and the way she spoke was often fierce and cruel. </p><p>How could Su Yu possibly be interested in her?</p><p>\"Mian is very unique in her own way, so it's not surprising at all. Remember when she was still in school? She had something going on with the Qin family's son.\" Huo Siqian chuckled. </p><p>\"What? Su Yu likes Huo Mian? Are you sure this is not a joke?\" Shen Jiani was rather surprised; she knew her daughter had been trying to get close to Su Yu, but she couldn't imagine Huo Mian would have a tie with him. </p><p>Jiang Hong sipped on her wine gracefully and laughed, \"What's so funny about that? To each's own. Our Yanyan is pretty, like a flower, but she might not be Su Yu's type. It's hard to say when it comes to these things.\" </p><p>Shen Jiani glanced at Jiang Hong. She knew Jiang Hong did it on purpose, but she had no intention of arguing. </p><p>In terms of what happened during school, Huo Zhenghai was aware of everything. But they were all kids back then and were too young to speak of marriage. It had no business value, so he never took it seriously.</p><p>\"Where did you hear this? Is it true?\" Doubtful, Huo Zhenghai questioned him once more.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":316,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:30.133","Link":"Chapter-316","NameDisplay":"Chapter 316"},{"ID":181120950305875729,"Name":"Chapter 317: A Little Too Much Fun (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 317: A Little Too Much Fun (9)","Description":"<p>Chapter 317: A Little Too Much Fun (9)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"It came out of Su Yu's own mouth, is that real enough for you?\" Huo Siqian smiled mysteriously. </p><p>Huo Zhenghai was officially stunned, because he knew Huo Siqian was not someone to release misleading information just for the sake of it, especially when talking to him. </p><p>If Su Yu was really interested in Huo Mian.... </p><p>\"That's a very good thing then! Glorious days are ahead for our family!\" Huo Zhenghai nodded contently.</p><p>\"Honey, don't be too happy too soon. The girl had already publicly announced that she is no longer associated with us. We might not be able to profit from her through association,\" Shen Jiani reminded. </p><p>\"So? She is still a seed of the Huo family. If this information is accurate, then I will find a way to contact the Su family. If they want to have a respectable wedding, then I am the only one who can provide her the righteous royal identity for marriage.\" </p><p>The room fell silent after Huo Zhenghai finished speaking... </p><p>Everyone had their own ax to grind. Even Jiang Hong, who remained silent, was calculating. </p><p>But, Shen Jiani knew that regardless of what Huo Zhenghai decided on, it would always be in the best interest of her son and daughter. </p><p>Huo Siqian wanted to chuckle after hearing what his father said. </p><p>He also very much wanted to ask him if he was overthinking it. </p><p>How could his mind automatically move onto marriage already? Of course, none of them knew that Huo Mian was already with Qin Chu. </p><p>Huo Siqian was the only person who knew about their secret, just like years ago, when they were still in school. </p><p>He always paid too much attention to Huo Mian, so he was always the first to find out about her secrets. </p><p>Zhu Lingling napped for the entire day. In the afternoon, she showered, changed, and was in the midst of going out before Deng Kai's call came in. She had just turned on her phone. </p><p>Deng Kai asked her to meet him downstairs, and Zhu Lingling gladly went. </p><p>It was, after all, broad daylight. Nothing could possibly happen, and it was just below where she lived. </p><p>Deng Kai waited for her in a Prado Land Cruiser. Without a word, Zhu Lingling went up and slapped him across the face.</p><p>Just like Huo Mian, the slap was crisply delivered...</p><p>\"You scumbag. Here's a slap for you, we're over.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling turned on her heel to leave... </p><p>\"Lingling, wait.\"</p><p>\"There's nothing else you can say, it's not going to work between us.\" Zhu Lingling thought Deng Kai wanted to get back together with her. </p><p>\"I'm not here to ask for forgiveness, I'm here to advise you and your friend to pack your things and get out of here.\" </p><p>\"What do you mean by that? You won't allow us to live in this city just because I dumped you?\" Zhu Lingling turned back and glared at Deng Kai viciously. </p><p>\"It's not me, it's Young Master Zhou. He already gave out the word that he won't let you guys go easily. From what I know, he will look for his revenge soon. What your friend did to him last night had angered the entire Zhou Family.\" </p><p>\"What did my friend do?\" Zhu Lingling was a little stunned. </p><p>\"Did she not tell you she almost killed Zhou Guangming just to take you home?\" Deng Kai looked at Zhu Lingling profoundly and asked her. </p><p>\"Almost killed Zhou Guangming?\" Zhu Lingling was dumbstruck.</p><p>Why didn't Huo Mian mention that something this big happened? </p><p>Out of anger, Zhu Lingling grabbed Deng Kai by the collar and shouted, \"Tell me what happened last night.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling's face went from a shade of pale white to dark, and then purple after Deng Kai illustrated exactly what had happened last night... </p><p>Huo Mian went there all alone, rescued her, and almost killed somebody. </p><p>Qin Chu wasn't there, Huo Mian went looking for her all alone... </p><p>Holy sh*t, what did she get herself into, and she also dragged Huo Mian into this mess too! </p><p>Seeing Zhu Lingling completely dumbstruck, Deng Kai continued, \"Nevertheless, you were once my girlfriend. I never thought about marrying you, but I wasn't just fooling around with you either. Based on how long we've been going out, I would really advise you guys to get out of here. You should ask your parents to move too, or else they won't be able to escape blame either. Young Master Zhou is still hospitalized, he will seek revenge as soon as he is out, and you guys will be screwed.\"</p><p>\"What the f*ck is wrong with this world? We're the victims, and we need to run?\" Zhu Lingling swore. </p><p>\"What choice do you have? It's a world for the rich, and whoever is more powerful is the big daddy. The Zhou Family is very big and powerful, and they have all the money in the world. They can hire a professional assassin and kill your entire family in a matter of minutes. I'm not trying to scare you, but that friend of yours, she will be met with a fate worse than yours.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling calmed herself down a little after Deng Kai left. Then, she gave Huo Mian a call. </p><p>\"Hey, you're sober now?\" Huo Mian chuckled as if nothing was wrong.</p><p>\"Girl, why didn't you tell me the truth about last night?\" Unlike her usual self, Zhu Lingling's tone sounded extremely grave.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":317,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:30.587","Link":"Chapter-317","NameDisplay":"Chapter 317"},{"ID":181120950311738935,"Name":"Chapter 318: A Little Too Much Fun (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 318: A Little Too Much Fun (10)","Description":"<p>Chapter 318: A Little Too Much Fun (10)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"What truth?\" Huo Mian didn't plan to tell Zhu Lingling the truth, so she asked back, pretending not to know what she was talking about.</p><p>\"Deng Kai told me everything…\"</p><p>\"Ah, he told you already? It was no big deal. Anyways, we both got out fine in the end.\"</p><p>Huo Mian smiled faintly and her tone was pretty chill...</p><p>\"You as*hole, are you stupid? You almost lost your life, you know that, right?\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling couldn't hold it in anymore and began crying...</p><p>\"It wasn't that serious, I was just trying to scare that scumbag. I wasn't actually going to kill him! If I did that, I would have to pay with my life.\"</p><p>\"Bullcrap, don't lie to me. I know exactly the kind of person you are.\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling was bawling her eyes out, ruining her eye makeup. Passersby stared at her panda eyes...</p><p>\"What the hell are you all looking at? Scram!\" Zhu Lingling cursed at the crowd gathered around her.</p><p>\"Girl, stop crying. I'm not dead yet, right? Anyways, if I didn't fake that 'a life for a life' attitude, how could I have rescued you? Those people aren't idiots.\"</p><p>\"Damn, Huo Mian. You're lucky that you're fine. If something had happened to you, Qin Chu would've cut me into eight pieces, tortured me, minced me, fried me…\" Zhu Lingling was afraid to imagine how Qin Chu would feel if he knew that something almost happened to Huo Mian.</p><p>\"But nothing happened, right? I've always been a lucky girl.\" Huo Mian laughed.</p><p>\"That damned scumbag Deng Kai, he told me that we should run away, because the Zhou family will seek revenge.\"</p><p>\"Let's not run away, because if they really wanted to kill us, we'll never be safe, no matter where we are. Also… I think that the most dangerous place is the safest place,\" Huo Mian calmly analyzed.</p><p>\"Of course we don't need to run, as long as you have Mr. Qin, no one will dare to hurt you. You have to be careful though, look out for yourself on your way to and from work.\"</p><p>\"Mhm, I'll be careful. You should ask your mom and dad to lay low for a while. Tell them to go on a trip or something.\"</p><p>\"Mhm, I'll arrange it.\"</p><p>Before Zhu Lingling hung up the phone, she said in all seriousness, \"Girl, I'll remember everything you did for me. If there's a day that you need me, my life is yours.\"</p><p>\"Stop blabbering, why would I want your life? It's not worth much anyways.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was afraid that Zhu Lingling would get emotional, so she hung up immediately...</p><p>Zhu Lingling and their friendship went without saying; they had maintained a great relationship all these years.</p><p>When she was out of money, Zhu Lingling transferred money without a second word. She helped Huo Mian as much as she could.</p><p>Huo Mian thought that at her age, she was no longer an ignorant girl and was already on her path to maturity.</p><p>She didn't care about pleasing others anymore. She hung out with whoever pleased her and avoided whoever exhausted her.</p><p>It was better to please herself than please others. She would rather be lonely than to betray her feelings. She would rather have regrets than to go with the flow.</p><p>The saying 'To those who cannot enter my heart, I'll treat with disdain and apathy. To the one who can enter my heart, I'll treat him as a king' was true.</p><p>In her heart, Qin Chu was her king...</p><p>However, she didn't know what happened to her king last night, as he had no contact with her today.</p><p>To test out the waters, Huo Mian sent him a Wechat red pocket...</p><p>It wasn't worth much, she sent him only 8.88 yuan as a bait.</p><p>He accepted the money immediately...</p><p>Huo Mian was happy and she sent him a WeChat message, \"Mr. Qin, you busy?\"</p><p>She waited for a long time but he didn't respond...</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>In anger, Huo Mian posted a status onto her friend circle, \"If you sent somebody a WeChat Red Packet and they accept it but still won't reply to your WeChat messages, what's happening?\"</p><p>She did not think that somebody would comment as soon as she posted it. Huo Mian thought it was that brat, Zhixin.</p><p>She was surprised to see that it was actually Qin Chu.</p><p>He commented, \"Then you must've done something wrong.\"</p><p>Huo Mian wanted to cry but had no tears, replying, \"Mr. Qin, I didn't. Everyone knows that I'm innocent, I've been loyal to you. The sun, the moon, the heaven, and the earth can all prove it.\"</p><p>However, Qin Chu stopped replying...</p><p>He was still giving her the silent treatment...</p><p>Huo Mian was on the edge that entire afternoon. After she returned home from work, she waited for him, pacing around as she did.</p><p>It was around eight that Qin Chu eventually opened the door to their condo.</p><p>\"Mr. Qin, you must be tired. Do you want coffee or tea?\" Huo Mian tried her best to please him.</p><p>\"I don't want to talk to you.\" Leaving his words behind him, Qin Chu walked upstairs.</p><p>Huo Mian was speechless.</p><p>Finally, Huo Mian couldn't take it anymore. She said, \"Qin Chu, you as*face, stop right there.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":318,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:31.173","Link":"Chapter-318","NameDisplay":"Chapter 318"},{"ID":181120950315983570,"Name":"Chapter 319: Her Husband Is the Boss (1)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 319: Her Husband Is the Boss (1)","Description":"<p>Chapter 319: Her Husband Is the Boss (1)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Upon hearing Huo Mian's words, Qin Chu stopped in his tracks...</p><p>\"Don't you think that you're being a little unreasonable?\" with her cheeks puffed, Huo Mian angrily asked.</p><p>\"Shouldn't I be the one saying that?\" Qin Chu turned his head and stared Huo Mian down.</p><p>\"Please… don't beat around the bush, if you have something to say, just say it, or it feels really weird, don't you think?\"</p><p>Huo Mian didn't like being ignored by Qin Chu; that feeling was extremely unpleasant.</p><p>Seeing her ask, Qin Chu turned around and walked down the stairs.</p><p>He walked up to Huo Mian and looked at her for a whole three seconds.</p><p>\"Good, then let me ask you again, where were you last night and what happened?

But, how could you not tell me something as big as this, do you not treat me as your husband? Or am I just a household decoration to you?\"</p><p>It was clear from listening to Qin Chu's words that he was angry...</p><p>The thing that infuriated him the most was that Huo Mian always did her own thing and hid secrets from him.</p><p>He was so worried about her, but she refused to tell him anything.</p><p>As expected, Qin Chu found out about everything, biting her lips, Huo Mian pondered.</p><p>At last, she decided to tell Qin Chu everything that happened. She grabbed Qin Chu's hand and pulled him down onto the couch.</p><p>She briefly explained what happened last night, leaving out some details.</p><p>But what she didn't know was, Qin Chu had already seen the video. How could he still not be aware of everything that happened?</p><p>\"That's everything, I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry. Also… I came back safely, didn't I?\"</p><p>\"Next time when you're in trouble, talk to me first.\"</p><p>\"You were on a business trip in the neighboring city, right? Driving back wouldn't have been fast enough. Lingling was in grave danger, and I acted in a hurry.\" Huo Mian looked for excuses.</p><p>\"I wasn't in the city, but I could have used my connections. Although I recently returned to the country, I am still the president of GK. Your husband is a boss, not a wimp. We've known each other for so long, why do you not trust me?\"</p><p>Qin Chu frowned and demanded...</p><p>\"I was wrong.\" Huo Mian finally lowered her head.</p><p>\"About what?\"</p><p>\"I shouldn't have kept all of this from you, I should have told you last night.\"</p><p>\"No, you should've told me as soon as Zhu Lingling sent you that WeChat. I would've arranged everything and not let you face danger alone,\" Qin Chu added.</p><p>\"Yes, yes, yes, everything you're saying is right.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>She was afraid to be lectured by Qin Chu...</p><p>\"You only know how to lay me off, you say that everytime, and then make the same mistake every time.\" This time, Qin Chu wasn't going to go easy on her.</p><p>Realizing that she was about to be lectured again, Huo Mian immediately coughed a few times...</p><p>\"Ahem… ahem, sorry, ahem, I know that, ahem, I made a mistake. Ahem ahem, next time… ahem, I'll be careful.\" Huo Mian's sentence sounded choppy because of the coughing.</p><p>She held her chest and appeared to be in pain.</p><p>Of course, once he saw her like this, Qin Chu immediately became worried and patted her back gently. He softly said, \"See?

Then, he walked into the kitchen and made some brown sugar ginger water to warm up her body.</p><p>Holding the cup of warm brown sugar ginger water in her hands, a smug smile appeared on Huo Mian's face.</p><p>She knew no matter how powerful Qin Chu was, he would panic as soon as she showed an impression of weakness...</p><p>He wouldn't even be able to tell if she was really sick or pretending...</p><p>The next day at work, Huo Mian was stopped by Deputy Director Guo after the morning meeting.</p><p>\"What's going on, Deputy Director Guo?\"</p><p>\"Huo, South Side is choosing the best employee of the month, and I nominated you. As soon as Director Wu approves it, you'll receive a bonus of twenty thousand yuan.\"</p><p>\"No, it's fine. Deputy Director Guo, I don't think that I'm that outstanding. I'm just doing my job.\" Huo Mian didn't want to be in the spotlight and be awarded the best employee. To be frank, she didn't think of herself as someone outstanding.</p><p>Her situation now was different from what it was in the beginning. She was quite poor when she had first started as an intern at the First Hospital.</p><p>She was in dire need of money and therefore asked the head nurse for a bonus.</p><p>Now, she no longer needed money, and she only wanted to do her job. She wanted to give the bonus to someone who actually needed it, or else she would feel guilty.</p><p>\"Ugh, I said that I nominated you. Mr. Huo gave us so much funding, and it was all due to you.\"</p><p>Deputy Director Guo brought up Huo Siqian again, which gave Huo Mian a repulsive feeling.</p><p>\"Deputy Director Guo, sorry, I don't have a great relationship with Huo Siqian. He's him and I am me, you don't have to give me special treatment because of him.\"</p><p>\"Ha, I know, I won't let word get out. Don't worry and keep doing what you're doing.\" It seemed like Deputy Director Guo didn't understand what Huo Mian was trying to express. He left after trying to please Huo Mian with his words.</p><p>It bummed Huo Mian out...</p><p>- During lunch break -</p><p>A black Rolls-Royce slowly parked in front of South Side Recuperation Centre.</p><p>Huo Zhenghai exited the car, followed by two bodyguards and a chauffeur.</p><p>It may have been because his weak body was susceptible to chills because another bodyguard held an umbrella over his head.</p><p>He looked very stylish, dressed in a black wool coat. Huo Zhenghai had a smileless face and was exuding the aura of an aristocrat.</p><p>When Huo Mian saw him at the door of her office, she glanced at him and lowered her head, continuing to organize her reports.</p><p>She had no intention of talking to him...</p><p>\"Mian,\" he spoke first.</p><p>Then, Huo Zhenghai waved his hand, signaling his people to take their leave and close the door behind him.</p><p>\"Mr. Huo, don't waste time on me. I won't return to the Huo Family. I trust that you must've seen the official statement. I don't want to waste time bickering, as I am busy at work. Please leave.\"</p><p>To avoid an unpleasant conversation, Huo Mian straight up asked him to leave...</p><p>However, Huo Zhenghai had no intention of leaving. Instead, he sat down in front of Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Mian, I understand what you're going through. Your mom and you have had some rough years, and as a father, I haven't been dutiful to either of you. I can understand if you blame me.\"</p><p>\"Thank you for your understanding, I won't bother seeing you out.\"</p><p>Huo Mian's face was ice cold; she didn't even raise her head or glance at Huo Zhenghai once.</p><p>She was speechless with this cold-blooded businessman in front of her.

I'll be happy no matter who marries into the Su Family.\"</p><p>\"Don't you think that it's funny to say such contradictory words? I feel like laughing just listening to you. How could I ever be the same as Huo Yanyan? She has been a socialite for more than twenty years, and I've been 'blessed with' the burden of being your illegitimate daughter for about the same time. Huo Yanyan and I are completely different, whether it's status, fame, or prestige.

The dress suited her, and it made her look beautiful and elegant.</p><p>Many people in the private room asked to take pictures with her.

I'll be with whoever I am interested in at that moment, or did you forget the rules?\"</p><p>\"No, I just… I just feel like Mian Mian is a schemer, copying the way I got into the spotlight. Maybe she's not being sincere, only approaching you for fame and profit.\"</p><p>\"Saying that makes it sound like you aren't after the same thing,\" Su Yu sneered.</p><p>Realizing that she said the wrong thing, Zhao Qingya quickly explained, \"President Su, I am different from her.

He basically forced her away. Didn't you see her when she left? Her eyes were red, and she was really sad. She clearly didn't want to leave.\"</p><p>\"Then what happened? Is he going celibate?

Stop them as soon as they act.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Young Master.\"</p><p>After hearing news of the Zhou family's intention to retaliate, he was worried about Huo Mian. Therefore, he immediately ordered surveillance on them.</p><p>He then rolled onto his bed and flipped out a photo of Huo Mian he took on his phone when she wasn't looking. Looking at the candid shot, his gaze became ever so soft.</p><p>\"I really do miss the days at South Side,\" Su Yu smiled as he muttered to himself</p><p>After her morning shift, Huo Mian drove to Zhixin's school to find him.</p><p>The siblings ordered some food at a restaurant on campus and sat down.</p><p>\"Sis, you seem to be less busy ever since your promotion. How did you get off work so early?\" Jing Zhixin asked while slurping noodles.</p><p>\"Yeah, South Side is not busy like hospitals. Here, it's all about resting and over there it's all about emergent cases. They're very different.\"</p><p>\"That's good. You can rest more and have more time for yourself.\"</p><p>Huo Mian took out 3000 yuan from her bag and placed it on the table.</p><p>\"Here, take this. Now that I'm making more money, I can give both you and Mom a little more too. Plus, you're all grown up now, and dating is expensive.\"</p><p>\"Ahem… Sis, I'm not dating, that girl isn't my girlfriend.\"</p><p>Thinking back to the time when he ran into his older sister at the movie theatre with a girl named Zheng Yanru, he immediately explained.</p><p>\"You don't need to be embarrassed! You're already a university student!\" Although she didn't want Zhixin to date at such an early age, she wasn't about to object. She wasn't inconsiderate.</p><p>\"Sis, she really isn't. Although she's interested in me, I rejected her. Plus, she's pretty much a snob, and she uses her looks to flirt with guys at the university. How could I like a girl like that?\"</p><p>\"Alright, I'm relieved to see you so clear-headed.\"</p><p>\"Sis, I don't need your money. I got a part-time job and made enough money to last until the end of this semester.\"</p><p>\"What part-time job did you get this time?\" Huo Mian stilled.</p><p>Jing Zhixin scratched his head and chuckled awkwardly, \"If I tell you, you can't yell at me. I downloaded the Didi app (TL note: Chinese Uber) and I'm using the car Qin Chu gave me to drive people around. I've had a lot of business! Also, I've made arrangements with wedding planners to rent out the car whenever I'm not using it for class. I charge 800 yuan each time and the wedding planners and I each get 400.\"</p><p>\"Not bad, brat, you're quite the businessman.\"</p><p>\"You're not mad?\" Jing Zhixin looked a little worried.</p><p>\"Why would I be mad? You're earning money through hard work. Mom and I don't expect anything from you. We're happy as long as you can take care of yourself in the real world.\"</p><p>\"Of course! Don't worry Sis, I'm not going to be a useless loser. Oh right, how's it going with Qin Chu?\"</p><p>\"We've known each other for so many years now, so it's going pretty well.\"</p><p>\"That's good then.

I'll wait for him here.\"</p><p>\"Ugh… alright, Can I get you something to drink?</p><p>\"Coffee please, thank you.\"</p><p>Exhausted, Qin Chu returned to his office after his hour-long meeting.</p><p>He sat in front of his desk and quietly began reviewing the data on his computer.</p><p>Suddenly, a pair of small warm hands covered his eyes.</p><p>A mischievous voice sang, \"I just quietly covered your eyes.

After being Qin Chu's assistant for so long, Assistant Yang quickly learned the ways to surviving such a role; he was much cleverer than he was before.</p><p>\"Your assistant is funny. Haha~\" Huo Mian couldn't help but laugh at the sight of Assistant Yang's terrified face.</p><p>\"He's much better now. It was even funnier when he first got here.\"</p><p>The lovers continued their lovey-dovey embraces while Assistant Yang almost peed his pants outside the office.</p><p>Thank goodness I ran away fast.

I think I have way more than enough.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was mostly using her own salary for her spendings, and her salary had also increased a lot along with her promotion.</p><p>With Qin Chu arranging her day-to-day needs, she didn't need to spend too much.</p><p>She didn't touch a single cent of the 50,000,000 yuan and Qin Chu's monthly salary.</p><p>Although Qin Chu didn't want to send his wife home to her mom, he could understand her feelings.</p><p>So, even if he was going to miss her dearly, he didn't want to tell her. He wanted to make sure that she was happy.</p><p>The couple both enjoyed the meal. When they arrived home, a phone call from the company pulled Qin Chu back to work.</p><p>As for Huo Mian, she took a shower and immediately got into bed, lying there as she flipped through some books and enjoyed some light music, relaxed as could be.</p><p>The next day, when Huo Mian got off work, she bought a few baskets of fresh vegetables and fruits and headed straight for her old house.</p><p>Due to his night classes, Zhixin hadn't returned home yet.</p><p>Yang Meirong cooked an entire chicken and made her some stir-fry dishes. The mother and daughter enjoyed a very rich dinner.</p><p>Suddenly, the door was pushed open and in came two people.</p><p>The person in the front was Auntie Wu, their next-door neighbor. As for the person behind her, Huo Mian couldn't see clearly enough to recognize their face.</p><p>\"Oh? Did you just start eating?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\" Yang Meirong got up and pulled up a chair for her to sit down in.</p><p>\"Mian, you're back!\" Aunty Wu gave an especially friendly smile to Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Auntie Wu!\" Huo Mian greeted.</p><p>\"Just in time! My son, Liang, is also off for a couple of days and he's been complaining about being bored. Now that Huo Mian's back, the two of you can keep each other company.\"</p><p>\"Liang came back?\" Yang Meirong looked towards the man standing behind Auntie Wu.</p><p>Huo Mian also turned to look and was surprised by the huge change Xu Liang had gone through.</p><p>As neighbors, they've known each other ever since they were little and she had always known him as a very quiet boy.</p><p>Because he was older than Huo Mian by quite a few years, they weren't very close.</p><p>Later on, Xu Liang left the city for university, only returning after he graduated. Apparently, he was now working in a bank.</p><p>Now that he was 30 and still single, Auntie Wu was very worried.</p><p>\"Hello, Auntie Yang,\" Xu Liang greeted Yang Meirong with a smile.</p><p>Xu Liang was 178 cm tall and looked very proper. He wasn't handsome but had clean features.</p><p>His black suit embodied the characteristics of a bank employee and he was pale and plump.</p><p>Plus, with Auntie Wu's above-average means, Xu Liang was born with a little sense of pride.</p><p>\"Have the two of you eat yet? Care to have some more? I made chicken stew. Mian bought the chicken today and apparently, it's organic chicken fed with corn. I do like the taste.\" Yang Meirong was especially friendly.</p><p>\"It's alright, we ate already. Oh right, is the white car parked outside your home yours?\" Auntie Wu was surprised by the white Volkswagen CC parked outside.</p><p>Before Huo could answer, Yang Meirong said, \"That's Mian's car.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":326,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:35.483","Link":"Chapter-326","NameDisplay":"Chapter 326"},{"ID":181120950359868041,"Name":"Chapter 327: Her Husband Is the Boss (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 327: Her Husband Is the Boss (9)","Description":"<p>Chapter 327: Her Husband Is the Boss (9)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Oh wow, incredible, Mian bought a car,\" Auntie Wu complemented.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't want to seem high-profile, so she only nodded in response, \"I took out a loan to buy it. I live too far from work, so it's easier for me to get around with a car.\"</p><p>To her surprise, Xu Liang interjected, \"That's not just any car, it's an imported model. The engines on this thing are much more high-end than those made in China, and it's worth around 300,000 yuan.\"</p><p>\"That's expensive, Mian, you've done well for yourself.\"</p><p>Auntie Wu didn't know cars that well, but she knew that her son's Audi A4 was a little over 300,000 yuan, so she was impressed to hear that Huo Mian's car was around the same price.</p><p>\"I don't know much about cars, and a friend introduced me to this model, so I bought it.\" Huo Mian was unwilling to show-off her car. After all, that wasn't her style.</p><p>However, her mother was quick to interject, \"Mian is now a head nurse at her hospital and earns more than 10,000 yuan a month.\"</p><p>\"That's great! I heard that South Side is filled with rich people. Mian, you didn't find yourself a boyfriend from all the rich heirs?\"</p><p>Auntie Wu was a big gossip, and Huo Mian didn't know how to answer her. She didn't like to deceive others or lie, but as of that moment, she couldn't tell her mother the truth, because her mother couldn't know about her and Qin Chu.</p><p>Therefore, she shook her head, \"No, I didn't. Those admitted to South Side are all patients, and as medical professionals, we don't really interact with them outside of work.\"</p><p>\"You're right, Mian had been an honest and humble kid ever since she was a little girl. She's not like other girls her age who wear short skirts and heavy makeup. That's a good thing.\"</p><p>They chatted until Huo Mian was full from all the food…</p><p>Just as she was about to go into the house and tidy up the bedroom, Auntie Wu said, \"Liang, go take a walk with Huo Mian outside. Didn't you say that you had some medical questions you wanted to ask her about?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, Mian, go take a walk with Liang. You guys should have a lot to talk about.\" Huo Mian's mother said, after receiving Auntie Wu's signal.</p><p>This was such an obvious setup…</p><p>Huo Mian felt speechless…</p><p>However, Xu Liang took the initiative. He said to Huo Mian, \"Let's go.\"</p><p>Out of sensibility, Huo Mian had no choice but to get up and go with Xu Liang. Auntie Wu immediately said secretively to Yang Meirong, \"Hey, girl, what do you think of my son?\"</p><p>\"Liang is a good kid, but… our family conditions aren't that good, and we're no match for your family.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about? We've known each other for so long, do you really think that I'd look down on you? Originally, I didn't think too much about this because Mian had a boyfriend, but last time, I heard Zhixin mention that they broke up, so I began thinking about introducing Mian to Liang. A few days ago, I called to ask Liang what he thought of Mian and, to my surprise, he liked the photo of Mian I showed him. And, here we are. He took some time off work to come back to meet her, and I had plans to ask you to call Mian to come home so the two of them could meet, but she came back herself today. Look at that, it's fate, I know it.\"</p><p>Auntie Wu had a quick mouth and was a chatter bug. She also liked to play matchmaker and always made things sound much better than they actually were.</p><p>\"I have no objections as long as the kids like each other. I've known Liang since he was a baby, and I know that he's a good kid.\"</p><p>\"That's good, let's sit here and wait for their good news.\" Auntie Wu was exhilarated.</p><p>She was almost positive that Huo Main was bound to fall for her son…</p><p>As they walked around, Huo Mian didn't speak much. She hadn't seen Xu Liang in years, and all her memories about him were from when they were kids.</p><p>\"My mom said that you work at South Side Recuperation Center?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\" Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>\"Is it a lot of work? How's the overall work environment?\" All of Xu Liang's questions were well measured. She could tell that he was a proper person.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":327,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:35.987","Link":"Chapter-327","NameDisplay":"Chapter 327"},{"ID":181120950365083756,"Name":"Chapter 328: Her Husband Is the Boss (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 328: Her Husband Is the Boss (10)","Description":"<p>Chapter 328: Her Husband Is the Boss (10)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"It's not bad, work isn't too tiring.

I enjoy being around people like you, it gives me positive energy.\"</p><p>\"Um… thanks for the compliment.\"</p><p>\"You know what I do, right? I'm currently the Deputy Manager of our bank's Credit and Loans Department, and I've gotten a couple of raises.

Auntie Wu's met him before.\"</p><p>\"So, do you plan on dating or getting married anytime soon?\" Xu Liang probed.</p><p>\"Not yet.\" Huo Mian realized where he was going, so she immediately nipped his thought in the bud.</p><p>\"Really? That's a shame, my mom said that we would make a good couple. After all, we've known each other since we were kids and are aware of each other's' characters. Plus, our jobs are both stable, so if we get married, our quality of life won't be bad.\"</p><p>\"Haha… thanks for thinking so highly of me, but… relationships are complicated. Sometimes those who don't seem to match end up dating, while those who seem to match don't end up going anywhere.\"</p><p>\"There's a pub up front, do you want to go in for a drink?\" Xu Liang was still in high spirits.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy tonight. I need to leave now.\"</p><p>\"Oh, okay, what's your WeChat number? I can add you,\" Xu Liang said as he took out his phone.</p><p>\"I don't use WeChat, and don't have time to use it anyways.\"</p><p>\"What about your phone number?\" Xu Liang didn't want to give up.</p><p>\"Um… Xu Liang, I'm sorry, but I don't think we should exchange our contact information. I don't think it'll work out between us.\"</p><p>Xu Liang was surprised by Huo Mian's upfront rejection.</p><p>During his previous set-ups, it was the women who took the initiative. After all, he had a good job and came from a good family.</p><p>He originally thought that getting Huo Mian to date him was going to be easy as pie, but to his surprise, Huo Mian immediately rejected him.</p><p>\"Nothing is certain; what if a possibility opens up in the future?\" Xu Liang was unwilling to give up.</p><p>\"There's no possibility, I'm really sorry if I sound offensive. I know that Auntie Wu did this out of the kindness of her heart, and I know that you're a good person. However, I should be able to make my own decisions, and I hope you can understand.\" The truth was, Huo Mian really wanted to tell Xu Liang that she was married, but if Xu Liang told Auntie Wu, she would definitely tell her mother. Therefore, after a lot of consideration, Huo Mian decided to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>\"Haha… okay then, if that's what you think, then I don't want to force you into anything.\" Xu Liang smiled bitterly.</p><p>\"Let's head back.\" Huo Mian didn't want to waste any more time since everything was already out in the open.</p><p>After a while, Xu Liang and Huo Mian arrived back at her mother's house, and Auntie Wu left with Xu Liang.</p><p>Huo Mian sat down beside her mother and helped her with laundry.</p><p>Yang Meirong rubbed at a dirty shirt while she nonchalantly asked, \"How did it go with Xu Liang?\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":328,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:36.51","Link":"Chapter-328","NameDisplay":"Chapter 328"},{"ID":18112095036959343,"Name":"Chapter 329: A Standoff Between Money and Power (1)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 329: A Standoff Between Money and Power (1)","Description":"<p>Chapter 329: A Standoff Between Money and Power (1)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Mom, he's not my type.\"</p><p>\"How old are you?

Have you paid posting fees?\"</p><p>Before she had a chance to look at their replies, someone suddenly sent her a video chat request…</p><p>The ID on her screen was 'My dearest Mr. Husband', along with a photo of Qin Chu, who looked dashing.</p><p>She doesn't remember noting Qin Chu like that; how did that happen?</p><p>Nervous, she accepted the video chat and lowered the volume.</p><p>The good thing was, Huo Mian's room was quite far from her mother's.

Don't you know to go home early and get some rest?\"</p><p>\"Even if I go home, I'll still be alone.\" Qin Chu's answer was short and to the point.</p><p>He sounded like a poor little housewife who was wronged.</p><p>His tone was full of sorrow...</p><p>\"Ahem… don't worry, I'll be home soon.\"</p><p>\"I miss you,\" Qin Chu said as he stared at Huo Mian through the phone.</p><p>She had on a lilac sleep dress with a mickey mouse on it; she looked adorable.</p><p>Upon hearing what Qin Chu suddenly said, Huo Mian's cheeks felt a little feverish.</p><p>\"Isn't there anything you want to say to me?\" Qin Chu was obviously unhappy.</p><p>His dopey wife made no reactions after he told her he missed her, seriously?</p><p>\"I kinda miss you too.\"</p><p>\"Just kind of?\" Mr. Qin objected once more.</p><p>\"Hm… a lot.

Therefore, Huo Mian decided to get up from the bed and look through her childhood albums.</p><p>Back then, phones were still too expensive, and old-fashioned photos were popular.</p><p>She took out her graduation photos and saw herself, young and innocent….</p><p>She missed the good old days. Sometimes, she had the feeling that from 14 to 24, those ten years of her life, felt like a century. So many things happened during that decade, including her meeting and breaking up with Qin Chu.</p><p>After all of this, they still ended up together. She couldn't help but exclaim at this magical little thing called 'fate'.</p><p>It was already 11:30 PM by the time she put away her albums, and Huo Mian was a little hungry.</p><p>She wanted to make herself some instant noodles but realized that there wasn't any at home.</p><p>Her mom had been really into health lifestyle recently, so she threw out all of their junk food. Huo Mian's hunger grew as she was contemplating what to do.</p><p>Out of boredom, she began looking through her WeChat friend circle, and then she noticed that foodie Gao Ran was having barbeque and kebabs.</p><p>He posted a total of nine photos of the barbeque he was eating… talk about courting envy…</p><p>Zhu Lingling commented, \"It's so late, why are you eating this much? You're going to turn into a pig.\"</p><p>Gao Ran immediately replied, \"This young master has a special physique, I don't get fat when I eat. Thank you very much for your worries.\"</p><p>\"Hey, can you guys not quibble? I'm really hungry, so please don't post photos like that at this hour!\"</p><p>Gao Ran laughed at Huo Mian's comment, \"Ask your super-whipped hubby to make you some food.\"</p><p>\"I'm at my mother's, thank you very much for your worries.\"</p><p>\"Haha, looks like someone's spending the night alone.\" Gao Ran displayed typical schadenfreude.</p><p>Huo Mian became hungrier and hungrier the more she looked at Gao Ran's photos, and ended up stealing one of his photos of some barbeque chicken wings and posting it on WeChat.</p><p>\"If someone were to bring me a box of chicken wings right now, I'll thank them and all their ancestors.\"</p><p>The truth was, she was just venting…</p><p>15 minutes later, Huo Mian's phone began ringing.</p><p>\"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Come out.\" It was Qin Chu's bossy voice.</p><p>\"Right now?\" Huo Mian wasn't sure if she heard right.</p><p>\"I'll give you 20 seconds.\" Then, Huo Mian hung up the phone.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately crawled out of bed and headed out the door.

I want to live longer than you. Once you die, I'll find myself a retired hottie to spend the rest of my life with.\"</p><p>\"I can guarantee that you won't be able to find anyone as handsome as I am. After all… we're a rare bunch.\"</p><p>\"Here you go again.\" Huo Mian knew that Mr. Qin's arrogance was rearing its head again.</p><p>\"Why did you come here all of a sudden?\"</p><p>\"We finished the meeting and I saw your WeChat post, so I drove over.\"</p><p>\"If I hadn't posted on WeChat, would you not have come?\"</p><p>\"No, I would've come either way.\"</p><p>\"Don't do that again, you still have to work tomorrow.\" Huo Mian felt a little bad for Qin Chu.</p><p>There was a lot of work to do at GK, and Qin Chu had to personally supervise many of their projects, so she knew how valuable his time was.</p><p>However, no matter how busy he was, he would still try his best to spend some time with her.</p><p>She wasn't stupid, nor was she oblivious towards all that he had done for her…</p><p>If in the beginning, she hated the Qin family and Qin Chu because of Uncle Jing's death, then now, after spending the last few months with him, the way he took care of her had slowly worn down the hate in her heart.</p><p>She even wondered if she should draw a clearer line about what happened. After all, Qin Chu's parents were the cause of Uncle Jing's death and not Qin Chu himself.</p><p>However, after all that was said and done, there was still that incident between them; they just bothg chose to ignore it.</p><p>\"Mian,\" Qin Chu turned around and whispered into her ear.</p><p>\"Yeah?\"</p><p>\"I want to find an opportunity to tell your mom the truth and beg for her forgiveness.

I would be happy to strip off their skin if I get the chance.\" Yang Meirong immediately got agitated at the mention of Qin Chu's parents.</p><p>\"What I mean is… you're not young anymore, and your health isn't as good as it used to be.

Although her grades were high enough to attend Jing City's best medical school or maybe even an overseas medical scholarship program, because of Uncle Jing's death, all of that went to hell.</p><p>She became the sole bread maker for her family; her mother might've been through a lot over the past few years, but so had she.</p><p>No one lived as carefully as she did…</p><p>If Qin Chu hadn't returned, she would have remained an ordinary woman all her life and died that way.</p><p>\"Mom, I know, don't worry,\" Huo Mian vaguely replied, trying to hide her feelings.</p><p>After breakfast, Huo Main drove away from her mother's old house.</p><p>Distracted, she almost ran a few red lights.</p><p>Near an intersection by the overpass, Huo Mian suddenly stepped on her brakes.</p><p>She frowned after seeing the traffic light signal…</p><p>The red-light countdown was 300 seconds…</p><p>Seriously?? A 300 second red light?</p><p>This was the first time she's ever seen a red light so long. Usually, it was supposed to be 90 seconds, and even that was in the busy downtown area.</p><p>Why was there a stupid red light this long at an overpass that never jammed?</p><p>Flabbergasted, Huo Mian took out her phone and took a photo of it.</p><p>A black Lexus was parked not far from her off to the side.</p><p>The windows were tinted black so no one could see from the outside. However, the person inside could see everything out there.</p><p>Su Yu sat in the back seat of the luxury car with a can of cola in his hand.

Couldn't you have left me some of the covers? I'm not wearing any clothes too.\" </p><p>\"No one wants to look at you.\" </p><p>\"I want to look at myself, okay?\" </p><p>Gao Ran was also speechless... </p><p>Neither of them knew that the police officers had taken off Gao Ran's clothes. They also asked a female staff at the hotel to take off Zhu Lingling's. </p><p>Their intentions were to create an opportunity for them, but Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling were both so drunk that nothing happened. </p><p>\"We… Nothing happened last night, right?\" Zhu Lingling felt like crying as she looked at Gao Ran. </p><p>\"God bless me, I hope nothing happened.\" Gao Ran put his hands together. </p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Zhu Lingling was angered by the way Gao Ran was acting; he seemed to be even more opposed to the idea than she was. </p><p>\"Calm down, as a senior police officer, I don't think anything happened last night. First of all, we don't have any hickeys or any… mysterious fluids on us.\" </p><p>Upon hearing Gao Ran's words, Zhu Lingling looked down at her body and saw that neither he nor she had any marks on them. </p><p>\"Secondly, there's no condom on the ground or in the garbage bin.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling's expression darkened, how could he even think of that?</p><p>\"Thirdly, a normal man who was as drunk as I was last night wouldn't be able to get it up even if he took Super Viagra Ultra-Plus. So, we can conclude that nothing happened between us.\" </p><p>Zhu Lingling pondered for a moment and thought that his words made sense. Plus, her body felt normal. </p><p>When he saw Zhu Lingling's silence, Gao Ran said, \"If you don't believe me, we can go to the hospital. You can do a check-up and see if there's any… um, you know, in your body. If there is, I will take responsibility. I won't take advantage of you.\" </p><p>\"How are you going to take responsibility? Are you going to marry me?\" </p><p>Gao Ran fell silent… He had never thought about marriage, it was too sudden. </p><p>\"Whatever, I don't care what happened last night, but let's pretend nothing happened.\" </p><p>After speaking, Zhu Lingling pulled over her clothes and started to dress while still under the covers. </p><p>The two walked out of the hotel one after another, both of them looking really awkward. </p><p>When Gao Ran returned to the bureau, two little police officers smiled at Gao Ran mysteriously and asked, \"Boss, did you have a good night?\" </p><p>\"Good night?\" Gao Ran was taken aback. </p><p>\"Last night you drunk called 911 for a designated driver. When we got there, we saw you flirting with a girl so we brought you guys to a hotel and helped take off your clothes.

Are you that carefree?\" Su Yu was speechless. </p><p>\"How am I carefree?\" Huo Mian smiled, finding his words interesting. </p><p>\"Aren't you standing trial at the Provincial Higher People's Procuratorate next week?\" </p><p>Huo Mian's eyes flashed, \"How did you know? You are very well-informed.\"</p><p>\"Everyone in our circle already knows, a shady guy like Zhou Guangming only knows how to bully a woman,\" Su Yu said with disdain. He could easily screw over a dumb-rich guy like Zhou Guangming.</p><p>\"Oh, is that so?\" Huo Mian did not react much.</p><p>\"What do you mean, is that so? What are your plans?\" Su Yu asked restlessly.</p><p>It was an urgent situation, how could she be so calm?</p><p>The involved party was not anxious, but the bystander was…</p><p>\"What are my plans? Since he is suing me, I'll go to court. It's a crime to refuse to stand trial, right? If anything, I'll hire a lawyer to defend me,\" Huo Mian said nonchalantly.</p><p>\"It's not as simple as you think. The Zhou Family spent 3 million yuan to hire the number one lawyer in town, Mr. Zhang. He has a spiteful mouth, and as long as someone pays him, he will say whatever they want him to say. He has the ability to turn black into white and vice versa. If you are found guilty, you will have to go to jail.\" </p><p>\"I am innocent, why would I go to jail?\" Huo Mian chuckled. </p><p>\"The world is not as simple as you think, our society is complicated. People can distort the truth with money, do you understand?\" Su Yu said painstakingly. </p><p>\"I know, I always knew that this world is not simple.\" </p><p>\"What are you going to do then?\" </p><p>\"I'll face whatever comes my way.\" </p><p>Su Yu, \"…\" </p><p>Su Yu was speechless to see how relaxed Huo Mian was, it was quite different from what he was expecting. </p><p>Don't girls usually panic when they're faced with something like this? </p><p>Shouldn't she ask him for help? How could Huo Mian be so calm? As expected, she was not a normal girl. </p><p>\"If you need my help, then…\"</p><p>Before Su Yu could finish speaking, Huo Mian immediately interrupted him, \"That's not necessary, thank you.\" </p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Su Yu raised a brow. </p><p>\"Very sure.\" Huo Mian's answer was clear-cut. </p><p>\"Why?\" Su Yu was puzzled. </p><p>\"Ha, why do you need a reason? I'm contentious, I don't like owing others favors.\" </p><p>\"You can be assured that I won't ask for anything in return. I won't use this to threaten you or anything, I'm not that kind of person.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" </p><p>\"Then why would you refuse my help? As long as you ask me to, I will let the Zhou Family…\" </p><p>\"Thank you, but there's really no need for you to do that. It's almost time, I need to get to work.\" </p><p>After speaking, Huo Mian walked back to her car and drove away… </p><p>Su Yu was unsuccessful this morning, so he was quite upset. However, he was even more curious about Huo Mian now. </p><p>He wanted to see how she was going to get out of this crisis.

Did you push her?\" President Su looked at Mian Mian and asked. </p><p>\"No, no, no, I didn't do it on purpose, we were chatting and Qingya was walking out of the room when she slipped, and I was only trying to help her…\" </p><p>\"Yeah, President Su, she tried to help me but the floor was too slippery so I fell. It has nothing to do with Mian Mian. Please don't blame her.\" Zhao Qingya's words sounded like she was helping Mian Mian, but her words were actually all directed against her. President Su was smart enough to hear it through her tone. </p><p>As a higher-level executive of the company, Lisa did not side with anyone, but she was quite fed up with Zhao Qingya's pretentious behavior. </p><p>She explained, \"President Su, let's not pursue this matter any further, they are both celebrities under our label and have a lot of public activities they need to attend to. There's no need to blow this matter up. It will be bad if the media catches news of this and writes a report about it.

You're the one going to prison, and you threatened me to not use GK's legal team.\"</p><p>\"Um…\"</p><p>\"I'm the kettle, you're the pot, and you're calling me black.\" Qin Chu smiled.</p><p>After some more chit-chat, Huo Mian became sleepy and soon fell into deep sleep…</p><p>Qin Chu lowered his head and kissed her lovingly on the forehead.</p><p>\"Don't worry, as long as I'm here, no one will be able to hurt you.\" His voice was charming, like a magic spell.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":341,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:43.223","Link":"Chapter-341","NameDisplay":"Chapter 341"},{"ID":181120950438203495,"Name":"Chapter 342: You Won't Die If You Don't Court Death (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 342: You Won't Die If You Don't Court Death (4)","Description":"<p>Chapter 342: You Won't Die If You Don't Court Death (4)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>A week flew by; Huo Mian requested for a day off from South Side in preparation for the court date.</p><p>The hearing was scheduled for 9 AM, so Huo Mian got up at 7:30 AM.</p><p>She took a shower and washed her hair. Then, she chose a red blazer and black suit pants from her closet, along with a black shirt, giving an elegant feeling.</p><p>Most importantly, Huo Mian thought that red was a lucky color and hoped that everything would turn out fine today.</p><p>She let her hair fall on her shoulders and put on a tiny bit of makeup. She looked like a white-collar, ready for work.</p><p>When she arrived downstairs for breakfast, Qin Chu looked at her with a slight shock in his eyes.</p><p>He knew that Mian was pretty to begin with, but when she had makeup on, her beauty was comparable to that of international superstars.</p><p>\"You seem to be in a good mood today.\"</p><p>\"Of course, I can't lose morale. I heard that wearing red is lucky, so I'm really hoping that today will go well.\" Huo Mian picked up a glass of milk and drank it.</p><p>\"It will.\"</p><p>\"Definitely don't come to court today, okay?\"</p><p>\"I know.\"</p><p>\"The lawyer…\"</p><p>\"I found a lawyer for you, and he'll arrive at court on time. Don't worry, he's not from GK,\" Qin Chu hastily added in the end.</p><p>\"Thanks, Mr. Qin.\" Huo Mian smiled at him sweetly.</p><p>She was extremely satisfied with Qin Chu's arrangements…</p><p>She was afraid that if too many people showed up at court and Qin Chu went, he would suffer from rumors because of her.</p><p>Human beings were weird; Huo Mian didn't care about what others said about her, no matter how disgusting their words were.</p><p>However, she couldn't stand others talking crap about Qin Chu, that was something she couldn't tolerate at all, feeling as if she was also wronged by the whole world....</p><p>Plus, she didn't want Qin Chu to see her at her lowest…</p><p>She didn't have much of a chance of winning this time. If it weren't for Qin Chu's help, she couldn't even imagine what things might've come to.</p><p>Huo Mian believed in 'good will come to those who do good'. She was no Robin Hood, but she was diligent at her job and saved a lot of people, even if she wasn't supposed to.</p><p>But this time, if Zhou Guangming's attempted rape and drugging of Lingling and his treatment towards her made her end up in jail, then justice really didn't exist in this world.</p><p>The couple left home after having breakfast together, just like always.</p><p>Qin Chu didn't say anything more to her, but that was a good thing because it lessened her emotional baggage.</p><p>She drove herself to the Provincial Higher People's Procuratorate. This incident was a scandal inside the upper-class circle, so the Zhous made sure that word didn't get out. There was no sign of reporters, and the procuratorate assigned extra security by the front and side gates. It was obvious they treated this seriously.</p><p>However, Huo Mian thought it was unnecessary since it wasn't a murder case…</p><p>Su Yu also told her that the Zhous went through a lot of connections for this case, so things didn't seem favorable to her.</p><p>She saw the Zhous outside the procuratorate.</p><p>Zhou Guangming was surrounded by seven or eight people and walked up to the door as if he were the Queen of England….</p><p>When he saw Huo Mian, he looked away and pretended not to see her…</p><p>Huo Mian thought it was because he hated her, but that wasn't the case. Zhou Guangming still suffered from PTSD when he looked at Huo Mian.</p><p>Zhou Guangming's mother, on the other hand, spat out aggressively, \"Little b*tch, watch us teach you a lesson today.\"</p><p>\"You're not a young woman anymore, you should really be more discreet. After all, he's your only son…\"</p><p>Mrs. Zhou's expression immediately darkened upon hearing Huo Mian's meaningful remarks. She walked in without saying anything else.</p><p>Behind them was a man, about 30 years or so in age. He was skinny and had a depressed look on his face.</p><p>However, he was wearing a suit and holding a professional-looking briefcase.

You should be a philosopher.\"</p><p>\"Stop it, let's talk about the real deal.\" Zhu Lingling pushed Gao Ran.</p><p>Originally, Zhu Lingling didn't want to ask Gao Ran to come with her, but then she realized that without him, she couldn't even get in.</p><p>Not a lot of people were allowed into the trial today, and the provincial procuratorate was especially strict about who gets to enter.</p><p>When Zhu Lingling found out about the court date, she comforted Huo Mian for a while last night and woke up early so she could come to support her.</p><p>\"Don't worry, speak the truth, and don't become agitated, or else the judge will be biased against you. Be elegant, from start to end. Anyways… you'll be fine.\"</p><p>Gao Ran knew Qin Chu too well; he spoiled his wife so much that he wasn't going to let anything happen to her.</p><p>He only came to show support for Huo Mian, so that she wouldn't be too stressed out.</p><p>\"Hey, where's Qin Chu.\" Zhu Lingling looked around but didn't see Qin Chu anywhere.</p><p>\"He didn't come, he went to work.\"</p><p>\"What? He went to work? His wife's being sued, and he still has the heart to work? Seriously?\"</p><p>Zhu Lingling immediately erupted upon hearing that Qin Chu wasn't here. She was furious.</p><p>\"Chill, girl, I told him not to come. He's a person of special status so if he comes, people will notice. I would hate it if the Zhous took that opportunity to spread rumors.\"</p><p>Gao Ran nodded and knocked on Zhu Lingling's head upon hearing what Huo Mian said, \"There's such a big difference between her brain and yours. What did I use to say? Huo Mian is half fox, half monkey, and you're a complete pig and donkey mix.\"</p><p>\"Screw you.\" Zhu Lingling was so furious that she kicked Gao Ran in the shin.</p><p>\"I'm serious, why don't you use your head and think whether it's a good idea for Qin Chu to come? If he came, things may become more serious. I can't believe you would ask such a brainless question.\"</p><p>He knew that Zhu Lingling was an innocent, simple girl. Huo Mian, on the hand, wasn't a scheming girl, but she was high in both IQ and EQ. Huo Mian thought about things from every angle, so Gao Ran admired how she dealt with things on a daily basis.</p><p>\"It's almost time, let's head in,\" Huo Mian said after looking at the time on her phone.</p><p>Then, the three of them walked into the procuratorate; her trial was held in courtroom 1.</p><p>The courtroom wasn't big, but it looked solemn. Huo Mian walked up to the defendant's table and realized that her lawyer hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>She wondered what kind of lawyer Qin Chu hired to defend her.</p><p>As she was thinking, a series of footstep sounds attracted everyone's attention.</p><p>Then, exclamations were heard from the crowd...</p><p>Zhou Guangming immediately lost his cool when he saw Su Yu. He was exhilarated, \"President Su, why are you here? I'm humbled by your presence.

He walked up to the first row and sat down. Beside him was Wei Liao, in a brown leather jacket.</p><p>Huo Mian glanced at Su Yu with a complicated look on her face…</p><p>She wasn't a narcissist and didn't think that she had insane charisma, but she was sure of one thing and that was that Su Yu wasn't here for Zhou Guangming…</p><p>When Huo Mian looked over at Su Yu, Su Yu returned her gaze.</p><p>His expression was complicated too… but she didn't know what that meant.</p><p>\"Hey, look at you, you should've done something to deal with this. Why go through so much trouble to come to the trial?\" Wei Liao was anxious for Su Yu and thought that it wasn't his usual style.</p><p>Just them, the crowd became excited again…</p><p>To Huo Mian's surprise, Huo Siqian showed up.

Over these past few years, Huo Siqian would float out of nowhere whenever she was in trouble. She was confused – was he a piece of super-sticky gum that she couldn't get rid of?</p><p>\"Why is Huo Siqian here?\" Zhu Lingling lowered her voice and asked.</p><p>\"How should I know? But if Qin Chu finds out that he's here, he won't be pleased.\"</p><p>Gao Ran always knew that Qin Chu didn't like Huo Siqian, not just because of his complicated emotions towards Huo Mian.</p><p>It was also because he was overly-complicated, and often did things under the table…</p><p>\"You seem to be worried about your sister,\" Su Yu looked at Huo Siqian and said profoundly.</p><p>\"We have the same goal.\" Huo Siqian smiled, his expression relaxed.</p><p>Just then, Huo Mian's gaze landed on them…</p><p>Huo Siqian waved his hand and smiled at Huo Mian. \"You can do it, Little Sister.\"</p><p>For some reason, Huo Mian always got goosebumps when Huo Siqian called her 'sister'.</p><p>Anyways, it made her feel extremely uncomfortable…</p><p>\"Don't worry, she'll be fine.\" Su Yu opened his mouth faintly.</p><p>\"I'm curious, how did you allow things to progress this far? If memory serves me right, you're courting my little sister, aren't you? Young Master Su, you are a man who wields great power, how can you stand the woman you like to be bullied thus far, huh?\" Huo Siqian teased, with an interesting smile on his face.</p><p>\"I wanted to help, but she wouldn't let me. Huo Mian… she has to be the weirdest person on this Earth, and one of a kind.\" Su Yu sighed.</p><p>If Huo Mian had agreed to let him help her, he would have made this incident disappear, and they wouldn't even have to appear in court.</p><p>However, she didn't want him to and told him up front not to interfere. He would seem overly desperate to still offer his help.</p><p>\"Okay, fine, I guess that's why my little sister is so charismatic.\"</p><p>Huo Siqian and Su Yu engaged in some more casual chit-chat until the judge and jury slowly entered the courtroom.</p><p>\"Please be quiet. I would like to invite both parties' lawyers,\" the judge said with a stern face.</p><p>Zhou Guangming's lawyer, Zhang Shaochang, entered first. No one was surprised to see him, because the word was already out that the Zhous spent millions to hire him to win this lawsuit.</p><p>However, when Huo Mian's lawyered entered, the entire room fell silent…</p><p>Both Huo Siqian and Gao Ran thought that it would be someone from GK's legal team, but… it wasn't.</p><p>When that grey-haired man walked into the room, the expressions on Su Yu and the others' faces all changed drastically.</p><p>Wei Liao lost his cool, \"Holy sh*t, holy sh*t, am I seeing right?

He has a JD degree from Yale University and teaches at the FBI. He's employed by Interpol USA and was the attorney for the USA Secretary of State's scandal with his female assistant.

I knew that even if Qin Chu didn't appear in court, he would still amaze us.\" Gao Ran knew Qin Chu well, so he was never worried that something would happen to Huo Mian.</p><p>Compared to everyone's shock, Huo Mian seemed calm, because she had never even seen Dennis Wu in person. However, she did see him on TV and magazines a couple of times.</p><p>\"So… is that really Dennis Wu?\" Wei Liao asked in disbelief.</p><p>\"I'm surprised.\" Su Yu had to admit that he only had the chance to meet Dennis Wu once, while he was studying abroad in the U.S., Dennis Wu gave a speech in the city he went to school at; it was spectacular, and even Americans respected this Chinese American very much.</p><p>Now that he was seeing him in person, as Huo Mian's lawyer, Su Yu finally realized that Huo Siqian wasn't bluffing back then.</p><p>Whoever stood behind Huo Mian… was indeed very powerful… He was at least powerful enough to hire Dennis Wu.</p><p>Dennis Wu wasn't someone you could hire, even if you had both money and power…</p><p>\"Okay, I have to admit that I'm shocked as well,\" Huo Siqian muttered to himself.</p><p>He knew that Qin Chu was going to take good care of Huo Mian, but he never would've guessed that he hired Dennis Wu.

She even called him 'uncle', which was really cute.</p><p>He nodded at Huo Mian to show his understanding.</p><p>On the other hand, Zhang Shaochang was beginning to sweat. He knew that if he lost a trial with no chance of winning to begin with, it would affect his future career as a lawyer. As a lawyer, the higher your success rate was, the more valuable you became. He had worked as a lawyer for almost 8 years now and barely lost. Therefore, his reputation had been pretty good, doing especially well these few years. However, if he lost today, life as a lawyer would definitely become harder for him.</p><p>Moreover, the lawyer of the opposing party was his mentor and he was defending such a scumbag client; if his peers found out, he would also be in big trouble.</p><p>No matter which perspective Zhang Shaochang looked at this trial from, he still thought it would be best to give up. Sadly, Mrs. Zhou didn't.</p><p>She was so aggressive that Zhang Shaochang had no choice but to bite the bullet…</p><p>\"Next, let's have the plaintiff's attorney cross-examine the defendant,\" the judge announced.</p><p>Faced with pressure, Zhang Shaochang slowly walked up to Huo Mian.

It's unspoken inducement.\"</p><p>\"Sustained, the plaintiff's attorney must let the defendant finish before asking additional questions.\"</p><p>Zhang Shaochang's expression changed slightly, and he felt even more pressured…</p><p>Dennis Wu looked at Huo Mian kindly, \"Please continue.\"</p><p>\"Lingling usually has a high tolerance for alcohol, and she would never drink to the point of losing consciousness. Plus, she went with her boyfriend that night, how did she end up in Zhou Guangming's lap, with her clothes all over the place?

Don't be so nervous.\"</p><p>\"Overruled.\" The judge, thinking that Dennis Wu had a point, immediately overruled Zhang Shaochang's objection.</p><p>When he saw what was obviously happening, Wei Liao took out a piece of gum and said, \"The Zhous are making a fool out of themselves, basically shooting themselves in the foot. Like that saying goes: 'You won't die if you don't court death'. Why did he have to sue her? I bet they're dumbfounded now that they've seen Dennis Wu.\"</p><p>\"I don't think the Zhous know who Dennis Wu is,\" Su Yu said calmly.</p><p>\"Of course they don't, the Zhous are overnight millionaires, they only recognize money. It's okay for them to not be in their right mind, but is Zhang Shaochang's head sewed onto his a*s? As a domestically renowned attorney, how can he not recognize his own teacher?\"</p><p>\"Zhang Shaochang probably has to heart to die right now, he seems really nervous so there are a lot of flaws in his reasoning which enabled Dennis Wu to easily catch his shortcomings. I think we can reserve a restaurant now, we can go to lunch soon.\" Huo Siqian smiled.</p><p>\"I'm curious, who hired Ms. Huo's lawyer? Don't tell me it's you.\" Wei Liao smiled lightly at Huo Siqian.</p><p>\"I'm not that powerful; Dennis Wu isn't someone that anyone with money can hire. Why don't you ask Mr. Su here?\"</p><p>\"Can't be him, hiring an attorney isn't his style. If he wanted to do something, the Zhous would go bankrupt in three days, and they won't have the time to stand in court like this. Exterminating the source of the trouble seems more like Mr. Su's style,\" Wei Liao teased.</p><p>However, Su Yu was still silent…</p><p>He knew the outcomes of the trial; Huo Mian was going to be fine. Yet, he didn't feel happy.</p><p>He faintly had the feeling that if he ever wanted to date Huo Mian, he would have to fight off her powerful boyfriend.</p><p>Her boyfriend was someone who could hire Dennis Wu, he wouldn't be easy to deal with.</p><p>Zhang Shaochang noticed that he was losing and became so anxious that he began sweating.</p><p>Worried, he quickly said, \"Your honor, we would like to provide an important video clip.\"</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":347,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:46.473","Link":"Chapter-347","NameDisplay":"Chapter 347"},{"ID":181120950469519286,"Name":"Chapter 348: You Won't Die If You Don't Court Death (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 348: You Won't Die If You Don't Court Death (10)","Description":"<p>Chapter 348: You Won't Die If You Don't Court Death (10)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Allowed.\"</p><p>After the judge nodded in approval, Zhang Shaochang's assistant handed him a USB.</p><p>Then, he handed it to the jury, and the foreman plugged it into a computer, subsequently playing the video on a projector…</p><p>It showed the frightening scene from that night…</p><p>Huo Mian held Zhou Guangming by the collar, while her other hand held tightly onto the broken beer bottle, which was pressed against Zhou Guangming's throat.</p><p>\"Big Brother Zhou…\" The men finally came to their senses and headed towards Huo Mian.</p><p>\"Don't come near, or else he's dead.\" Huo Mian pressed the beer bottle even harder onto Zhou Guangming's neck.</p><p>The sharp glass immediately penetrated the skin on his neck, and he howled in pain.</p><p>\"Oh sh*t this hurts, don't come near, back… back off.\"</p><p>Ka...</p><p>After this short clip, the video came to a stop…</p><p>Zhang Shaochang cleared his throat and said, \"That night was my client's birthday, and he was drinking with his friends when the defendant arrived and wreaked havoc at the party.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the defendant should be charged with attempted murder.\"</p><p>\"Objection, Your Honor, my client Ms. Huo Mian didn't know Zhou Guangming, and had no interactions nor was she in any way related to him prior to the night of the incident.

You, however, accused my client of attempted murder without providing enough proof. Therefore, you are intentionally defaming and falsely accusing my client.\"</p><p>\"The plaintiff's counsel needs to watch his language,\" the judge reminded him again.</p><p>Zhang Shaochang's expression became worse…</p><p>His mentor was extraordinarily diligent…</p><p>\"Mom, our lawyer doesn't seem to be so good at his job. Can we trust him?\" the Zhou Family's younger daughter, Zhou Guanghui asked anxiously.</p><p>\"Who knows, I thought he was one of the best lawyers in the country. I really hope that our money didn't go to waste, or else I won't forgive him,\" Mrs. Zhou spat viciously.</p><p>\"Okay, I apologize.

Our video is a much longer and a much more complete version of what happened. If everyone could please watch it before coming to a conclusion, that would be great.\"</p><p>\"Bring it up.\" The judge nodded.</p><p>Zhang Shaochang's expression changed drastically. He walked over to Mrs. Zhou and whispered to her, \"Didn't you say that the complete video was erased? How come they have a copy of it?\"</p><p>\"That's impossible, I spent a fortune hiring a hacker to access the Seductive Fox's security footage, steal this video, and delete the original. This wasn't supposed to happen.\" Mrs. Zhou was also dumbfounded.</p><p>The men working under her were very reliable, and they would never make a mistake as big as this one.</p><p>Zhou Guanghui looked at the lawyer in disdain, \"My brother is definitely going to lose, all thanks to your pathetic defense.

I don't know him, who is he?\" Huo Mian gulped down water as she secretly peeked at the old man organizing documents not far from her.</p><p>\"Uncle? Hahaha, did you really think he was just an ordinary old man?\" Zhu Lingling was speechless.</p><p>Gao Ran smiled but didn't say anything…</p><p>\"What's happening? Why are you looking at me like that? Who is he? Why are you guys being so cryptic?\"</p><p>Huo Mian thought that Qin Chu had found her a slightly more experienced lawyer, and never even assumed that he would be a person of significance.</p><p>Zhu Lingling made Gao Ran tell Huo Main everything he had just told Lingling about Dennis Wu.</p><p>Huo Mian was instantly petrified…</p><p>\"So… that kind-looking old man, is the God-like American Chinese attorney, Dennis Wu?\" Huo Mian asked, flabbergasted.</p><p>\"Yup.\" Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling both nodded.</p><p>\"Oh my god…\" Huo Mian was so shocked that she didn't know how to describe her emotions.</p><p>\"Um… asking him to defend me must have cost a lot, right?\" Huo Mian asked, feeling bad for her husband.</p><p>Gao Ran looked at her hopelessly. \"Look at you, get yourself together. Your husband is so poor that he has nothing but money, what are you feeling bad for? Plus, a lawyer like Dennis Wu can't be hired with just money. This just proves how powerful your husband is.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'm shocked as well. No wonder he agreed so easily when I told him I didn't want GK's legal team to defend me. It's because he already found someone better,\" Huo Mian said as she bit down on her lips.</p><p>\"So… having a husband like Qin Chu means that you literally don't have anything to worry about. You can walk sideways for the rest of your life if you want to.\" (TL: walking sideways is a metaphor for being able to do anything one wants without giving a sh*t)</p><p>\"I'm not a crab, why would I want to walk sideways?\" Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>During this break, Gao Ran secretly took a photo of Dennis Wu and sent it to Qin Chu via WeChat.</p><p>Gao Ran didn't have Qin Chu's WeChat, because Qin Chu, who put his wife before his bro, only had her on WeChat and no one else.</p><p>When they last saw each other, Gao Ran secretly used Qin Chu's phone to add himself on Wechat while Qin Chu was in the bathroom.</p><p>When Qin Chu found out, he wanted to delete Gao Ran, but Huo Mian persuaded him not to.</p><p>Therefore, in Gao Ran's point of view, being in Qin Chu's WeChat address book was more than glorious enough.</p><p>After all, aside from Huo Mian, the only other contact in Qin Chu's WeChat was Gao Ran himself.</p><p>\"?\" Qin Chu saw the photo but didn't know what Gao Ran meant, so he sent him a question mark.</p><p>The cold and indifferent reply completely complied with Mr. Qin's arrogant personality…</p><p>  (TL Note: Alright, that's all for today, finally didn't end on a cliffhanger, but stay tuned, there's another nice surprise from the court in the upcoming chapters.

Puzzled, Huo Mian wondered.</p><p>\"Who is she?\" Out of the four of them, Zhu Lingling was the only one who didn't know her, so she was confused.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":352,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:49.897","Link":"Chapter-352","NameDisplay":"Chapter 352"},{"ID":18112095050386268,"Name":"Chapter 353: Young Master Su’s Declaration of War (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 353: Young Master Su’s Declaration of War (5)","Description":"<p>Chapter 353: Young Master Su’s Declaration of War (5)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Um… I think she is Gao Ran's girlfriend.\" Huo Mian stumbled as a weird feeling crept up her spine.</p><p>\"Why are you here?\" Gao Ran was extremely surprised to see Lin Xuejiao.</p><p>He remembered that he especially asked for a day off today, right? Plus, no one could've told her where he was, right?</p><p>After they went on a few dates, Gao Ran decided to give up.</p><p>If it weren't for Huo Mian's incident, he would've ended things with her a long time ago. After all, he couldn't stand being with someone who suffered from 'Princess Syndrome'.</p><p>He much preferred iron ladies…</p><p>At least iron ladies lived like real people; why should girls pretend to be someone they're not, and live their lives in a lie?</p><p>It's not like they were in a movie.</p><p>\"Oh, I was shopping nearby and saw your car parked outside. I thought you were seeing some pretty girl behind my back, but I didn't realize that you were hanging out with friends. I'm sorry, I think I was thinking too much.\"</p><p>Then, before Gao Ran could respond, Lin Xuejiao walked up to Gao Ran, pulled up a chair, and sat down right beside him.</p><p>\"Wait… um… don't you have work today?\"</p><p>\"LV is having a sale this afternoon, so I asked for a half-day off. My friends and I went to buy some bags; it was a steal. I got this bag for a little over 9,000 yuan, it's cheap, right?\" Then, Lin Xuejiao took the bag off her shoulder and showed it off.</p><p>Zhu Lingling felt a little uncomfortable when she saw that woman pull up a chair and sit beside Gao Ran.</p><p>She didn't know what that feeling was, but it just felt uncomfortable.</p><p>\"Hm? Who's she? She's really pretty. I don't believe we've met, you're…\" Lin Xuejiao asked Zhu Lingling.</p><p>\"Zhu Lingling.\" Zhu Lingling introduced herself.</p><p>\"Hi, My name is Lin Xuejiao, I'm Gao Ran's girlfriend.\"</p><p>\"I know, you said that already. There's no need to repeat the same thing twice. After all… we're still young, and our memories are fine,\" Zhu Lingling said in all seriousness.</p><p>\"Haha, I'm sorry, I forgot that I said it already.\" Lin Xuejiao smiled without saying anything else.</p><p>Then, she intimately locked arms with Gao Ran…</p><p>Zhu Lingling didn't say anything else; while they ate, she occasionally chit-chatted with Huo Mian and completely ignored them.</p><p>Ever since Lin Xuejiao arrived, the four of them weren't as at ease as they used to be and couldn't talk about anything they wanted to.</p><p>Therefore, lunch was somewhat quiet…</p><p>\"President Qin, I heard that GK is developing a high-end residential area in the Northern New District, right next to Golden Coast, is that right?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\" Qin Chu valued each word he spoke.</p><p>\"It hasn't even opened for sale, yet the prices are already as expensive as 30,000 yuan per square meter.

That's great! Thank you, President Qin, I'd like to make a toast to you,\" Lin Xuejiao said as she picked up a wine glass.</p><p>Huo Mian snatched Qin Chu's wine glass and said with a smile, \"My husband has to drive later, I'll drink for him.\"</p><p>After they drank the glass of wine, Zhu Lingling had officially had enough. She patted Huo Mian's shoulder and said, \"Girl, I have to be somewhere. Let's hang out again soon, it'll be my treat.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll message you later.\" Huo Mian knew that Zhu Lingling despised fake pompous girls like Lin Xuejiao, so she didn't stop her.</p><p>Zhu Lingling didn't even say goodbye to Gao Ran when she left; she pretended that he didn't even exist.</p><p>Gao Ran wanted to send Zhu Lingling off, but Lin Xuejiao was stuck to him like glue.</p><p>The truth was, ever since that night, Gao Ran felt like something had been going on between him and Zhu Lingling.</p><p>Too bad their lunch was interrupted by Lin Xuejiao.

Women like that don't suit Gao Ran,\" Qin Chu analyzed.</p><p>\"I think so too, an iron lady like Lingling would be more compatible with him. Too bad they don't like each other.\"</p><p>\"How do you know that they don't like each other…?\"</p><p>\"Isn't that the case? Hey, let me see your expression, do you know something that I don't?\" Huo Mian felt like something was up, so she probed Qin Chu.</p><p>\"You're thinking too much, I don't know anything.\" Unwilling to reveal any more, Qin Chu laughed.</p><p>Then, he leaned back on the passenger seat and thought back at Su Yu's declaration of war; he wasn't surprised…</p><p>Su Yu had been investigating Huo Mian, and Qin Chu's people had been countering them. As early as that, Qin Chu guessed what Su Yu wanted.</p><p>Su Yu probably fell for Huo Mian, but Huo Mian was his and his alone. No one on this earth would be able to steal her from him.</p><p>Three days later, the local news reported that Tian Fu Mining was on the brink of bankruptcy, and its stocks were forcibly purchased by a mysterious company.</p><p>Overnight, the Zhous lost hundreds of millions that they couldn't pay back, so they had no choice but to mortgage the company.</p><p>Because of Zhou Guangming, who was sentenced to 7 years of jail time, the Zhous, a family of overnight millionaires, immediately lost all of their arrogance.</p><p>In three days, they became mice on the streets, chased by everyone in sight.</p><p>Mrs. Zhou was sick, and her daughter, Zhou Guanghui tried to borrow money from others, but no one would lend them any.</p><p>Her good friends from the old days ignored her, and the rich heirs that she used to flirt with suddenly all disappeared.</p><p>The Zhou Family suddenly understood how heartless this world was…</p><p>\"Hui, where are you going?\" Seeing her daughter all dressed up and made up, Mrs. Zhou feebly asked her.</p><p>\"My friend told me that a branch company under GK Corporation acquired our company, so I'm going to talk to their president and try to negotiate with him. If he agrees to let us off the hook, I'd be willing to sleep with him.\"</p><p>\"Hui… thank you for doing this.\"</p><p>The mother-daughter duo fantasized, but sleeping with Qin Chu? Yeah right.</p><p>No one, aside from Huo Mian, could enter within half a meter of Qin Chu's personal space.</p><p>Everyone at GK knew about this – the new president was not interested in women; he was also arrogant and aloof.</p><p>Zhou Guanghui arrived at GK but was stopped by the front desk because she didn't have a reservation…</p><p>Therefore, she waited outside, hoping to stop him when he got off work.</p><p>Zhou Guanghui had done her research and knew that Qin Chu was an extremely good-looking man, which made her happy.</p><p>She was pretty and had a good figure. No sensible man would say no if she was willing, right?</p><p>During the end-of-day rush hour, Zhou Guanghui became anxious as she watched the employees leave the building.

Didn't that girl win the lawsuit? Dennis Wu helped her, that was pretty impressive.\" Wei Liao comforted Su Yu when he saw how depressed he was.</p><p>Su Yu didn't say anything and just kept drinking…</p><p>Then, Tang Chuan walked over and said, \"Young Master Su, did you acquire Tian Fu Mining? Talk about being ruthless, you didn't leave them with anything. They're screwed, Zhou Guanghui is now trying to sleep around to get money for her family.\"</p><p>\"What does that have to do with me?\"</p><p>\"Weren't you the one who did it?\" Both Tang Chuan and Wei Liao knew that Zhou Guangming had pissed off a woman who Su Yu had recently become interested in.</p><p>\"It wasn't me.\"</p><p>\"That's weird, who else could it be?

Then, he stripped off his business attire and changed into what Huo Mian gave him.</p><p>When Qin Chu changed, he did not hide from Huo Mian. He took all his clothes off, exposing his upper body.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't shy away and looked at his face on.</p><p>She was secretly exclaiming how great her Mr. Qin's body was. It wasn't pale and had a tanned copper tint to it, which made it look extremely alluring. All men should have a great body like him!</p><p>A minute later, Qin Chu put on the shirt Huo Mian gave him. Looking at Huo Mian, he questioned, \"What is this?\"</p><p>\"It's the same as mine, a couple's outfit,\" Pointing at her own red t-shirt, Huo Mian said.</p><p>Qin Chu was speechless.</p><p>\"So, I have to wear this Mickey Mouse-patterned thing out?\"</p><p>Qin Chu had never worn a cartoon patterned-shirt in his entire life. His first time was paired with such a discernible color made him feel out of place.</p><p>\"I think it's great, what're you afraid of?\"</p><p>\"Ahem… can I… can I choose not to wear it?\" Qin Chu rubbed his nose and asked in a depressed tone.</p><p>\"Sure, but then you'll have to sleep in your room tonight.\"</p><p>\"Hey, it actually doesn't look so bad, I like the design.\" Qin Chu chickened out and decided to wear this cartoon t-shirt against his heart, just so he didn't get chased out of Huo Mian's bedroom.</p><p>\"When did you buy this?\"</p><p>\"A few days ago.\"</p><p>\"Where?\"</p><p>\"From some online store…\"</p><p>Qin Chu was silent before finally accepting the reality, \"Fine, you win.\"</p><p>So, under Huo Mian's tyrannical power, Qin Chu was forced to wear the cartoon outfit and the pair left their condo together.</p><p>\"You're not driving?\"</p><p>\"No, we're taking the bus today. Haha.\" Huo Mian seemed to be in a good mood. With a cartoon-patterned black backpack, she held Qin Chu's hand with a smile on her face.</p><p>It seemed clear that she was in a great mood, so Qin Chu did not continue to dampen her enthusiasm.</p><p>The two of them took the city transit for thirty or so minutes, and they finally got off the bus in an old district in the eastern suburb.</p><p>It was seven o'clock at night, but the area was bustling and lit up by street lights.</p><p>\"It's busy, how do you like it?\" proudly, Huo Mian asked.</p><p>\"A night market?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, it's been open for around three years, and I came every year. But it's never open for long. Once it snows, the night market closes. It'll be here for two months at most. This place is always bustling with people, and most importantly, they have a lot of tasty food.\"</p><p>Due to her common upbringing, Huo Mian really liked down-to-earth things.</p><p>Although Qin Chu did not particularly like stuff like this, Huo Mian did, and he would never dampen the mood.</p><p>The couple held hands and walked through the streets of the night market, watching people come and go. It was extra atmospheric.</p><p>\"Hey, there's a game over there I wanna try.\" After speaking, Huo Mian pulled Qin Chu in.</p><p>About three meters away, there were many stuffed toys placed around. There was a plastic basket opposite from it, with cloth bags inside…</p><p>The sign read 'one yuan per turn'. Although a lot of people were playing this game, only a few managed to get bags inside the basket.</p><p>It may have been because of the distance and how light the cloth bag was.</p><p>\"Sir, I'd like ten bags.\"</p><p>\"Alright.\" Taking Huo Mian's ten yuan, the boss handed her ten bags.</p><p>Huo Mian took five and gave the rest to Qin Chu, \"We each have 5, let's see who gets more into the basket.\"</p><p>\"What do I get if I win?\" Qin Chu asked in a hushed tone.</p><p>\"I'll treat you to dinner.\"</p><p>\"Not enough.\" Qin Chu was obviously unsatisfied.</p><p>\"I'll treat you to a slushie too.\"</p><p>\"Not interested.\"</p><p>\"What do you want then?\" Huo Mian asked back.</p><p>\"If I win, you have to spoon with me tonight without clothes on.\"</p><p>\"You pervert...\" Huo Mian's face reddened immediately.</p><p>\"So? Do you have the guts?\" Qin Chu provoked.</p><p>\"I'm not scared. What if you lose?\" Huo Mian was filled with confidence.</p><p>\"Then I'll strip naked and let you spoon me.\"</p><p>\"Screw you, Qin Chu.\"</p><p>Win or lose, why did Huo Mian feel like she was at a disadvantage either way?</p><p>\"Let's start. You'd better keep your word.\" After speaking, he didn't wait for her to reply and suddenly threw the bag without warning.</p><p>Like magic, he hit a stuffed toy.

Let's go get some street food here where it's authentic.\"</p><p>\"We'll get whatever you like.\" When Qin Chu turned around, he caringly took the toys from Huo Mian's hands and fixed her bangs for her.</p><p>\"How about sour and spicy vermicelli? It's super tasty when you pair it with multi-layered steamed bread,\" Huo Mian expressively said.</p><p>\"Sure.\"</p><p>It was like no matter what requests she posed, Qin Chu would satisfy her and never go against her wishes.</p><p>Huo Mian believed that the reason why they rarely fought was that Qin Chu agreed with her on most things.</p><p>He wouldn't purposefully challenge her because of small, everyday details like that.</p><p>The two sat in front of a stall with two bowls of spicy and sour vermicelli and two servings of multi-layered steamed bread in front of them.</p><p>\"Let's begin.\" Huo Mian rubbed the chopsticks with her small hands and began slurping the noodles in big bites.</p><p>Qin Chu held up his chopsticks, lowered his head, and ate in an orderly fashion.</p><p>To be frank, he had almost never eaten food from street vendors, because he thought they were unsanitary.</p><p>However, if Huo Mian liked it, he would eat it with her even if he knew he would get diarrhea…</p><p>Gao Ran once said that his love for Huo Mian wasn't just a normal one between a husband and wife, it was a love of pampering and indulgence.</p><p>Even if Huo Mian committed murder or arson, Qin Chu would still say that he supported his wife, no matter what she did.</p><p>It was a love that was blind…</p><p>Every time Gao Ran says something like that, Qin Chu would ask him, \"How many time in a person's life would they meet someone who they can love so blindly and indulgently? That is why I have to cherish her.\"</p><p>He wasn't wrong, there were so many people in the world and not many could find someone they were crazy about and was worth sacrificing everything for.</p><p>Thus, Qin Chu thought that Huo Mian was Heaven's gift to him, and he would never squander this hard-fought love between them.</p><p>\"Is it good?\" as Huo Mian ate, she raised her head to ask.</p><p>\"Mhm.\" Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>\"If it's good, you should eat more.\"</p><p>\"They put too much chili in mine, I want some of yours,\" looking at Huo Mian's bowl, Qin Chu said with puppy eyes.</p><p>Huo Mian didn't think twice before feeding Qin Chu a bite of sour and spicy vermicelli. Her actions were extremely affectionate.</p><p>Qin Chu carefully moved in, catching Huo Mian's vermicelli with his mouth, his expression immediately filled with happiness.</p><p>When he was in the United States, he never thought that this day would happen one day.</p><p>On such a simple evening, he never thought that he would be walking through the bustling city with Huo Mian, wearing matching couple outfits and having Huo Mian feed him sour and spicy vermicelli. It was like a beautiful dream that was both elating and unrealistic.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Chu zoned out with an entranced look on his face…</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Huo Mian asked, a little puzzled.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":357,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:52.37","Link":"Chapter-357","NameDisplay":"Chapter 357"},{"ID":181120950528315361,"Name":"Chapter 358: Young Master Su’s Declaration of War (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 358: Young Master Su’s Declaration of War (10)","Description":"<p>Chapter 358: Young Master Su’s Declaration of War (10)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>\"Nothing.\" Qin Chu was instantly pulled back to reality.</p><p>\"Why would you zone off for nothing?\"</p><p>\"I just suddenly remembered some things that happened back in America that made me a little emotional.\"</p><p>\"Huh?

They don't exist there.\" Qin Chu's answer was firm.</p><p>\"I believe you.\" Seeing Qin Chu's sincere explanation, Huo Mian decided to stop teasing him.</p><p>After the two of them finished eating, they passed by a little girl's ice cream stand. Unable to resist Huo Mian's begging, a vanilla ice cream appeared in Qin Chu's hands.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, bought a chocolate flavored one. However, after a few bites, she found it not satisfying enough.</p><p>\"Honey, let me have some of yours.\"</p><p>\"No, you'll get saliva on it.\" Qin Chu decisively rejected her.</p><p>\"Hmph, how dare you be disgusted with me… Why aren't you disgusted with me when we kiss, huh?

Is that such a good idea…\" Huo Mian thought she was sly enough, but Qin Chu was way slyer than she was.</p><p>How did the saying go again? There were always mountains that are taller? Indeed, there were people beyond people and heavens beyond heavens.</p><p>\"If you don't want to give me a bite, then fine. I'll go buy another one.

He even confronted Qin Chu at the restaurant and declared war on him...</p><p>However, today, when he saw Huo Mian and Qin Chu together with his own eyes, their happiness gave rise to a strong sense of defeat in Su Yu's heart.</p><p>That warm smile was something Huo Mian never showed him...</p><p>It was finally clear that she really didn't like him and didn't want anything to do with him.</p><p>However, the most important thing was that he hadn't discovered any information when he was investigating Huo Mian before. But now, his people were able to uncover everything.</p><p>His men faltered when reporting their findings, and after their report, Su Yu's feelings turned as sour like a lime.</p><p>\"The people I sent found out today that… Huo Mian and Qin Chu… are husband and wife.\" After speaking, Su Yu raised his glass and drank a mouthful of wine. It was obvious how depressed he was at that moment.</p><p>Wei Liao's face changed after hearing the news...</p><p>He would never have thought that things would turn out like this as well...</p><p>He had just found out that Qin Chu was the man behind Huo Mian and now about them being husband and wife. This was simply too shocking.</p><p>\"Uh… when did they get married? Why doesn't the press know?\" Wei Liao remembered clearly that GK's Qin Chu had just returned to the country too not long ago. When he took over GK, media outlets discreetly reported it for a few days.

It was really late when they started heading home, and there were no more buses.</p><p>In the end, the two were forced to call a cab home...</p><p>- Inside the bedroom -</p><p>Huo Mian was only draped in a towel when she came out of the bathroom.</p><p>Qin Chu put down the book in his hand and pridefully asked, \"Didn't you promise to wear nothing?\"</p><p>\"Uh… I just looked at the weather forecast and it said that it's going to be chilly tonight.

Someone who goes back on her words?\" Qin Chu stared at Huo Mian and questioned her in an unsatisfied tone.</p><p>Huo Mian had no words to back herself up...</p><p>Why must her husband have such a good memory and be so persistent?</p><p>\"Fine, fine, don't look at me like that. Otherwise, I would think that I did something to upset you. I'll take it all off, I'm not scared. Hmph, by then, you'll be the one who can't hold it and suffer.\"</p><p>Huo Mian was in high spirits as she took off the towel and dove under the covers in a flash before Qin Chu could take a good look.</p><p>That speed was fast...</p><p>\"You have really fast reflexes, I didn't even get a clear look,\" jokingly, Qin Chu said.</p><p>\"You can see it, in your dreams! Turn off the light and go to sleep.\"</p><p>\"The night's so long, are you sure you can sleep, my love?\" Tilting his head, Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian.</p><p>She was silent before answering, \"Qin Chu, what do you want?\"</p><p>\"What do you think?\" Qin Chu asked back.</p><p>\"Don't even think, hmph, I want to torture you. You can look and touch me, but you can't sleep with me.\"</p><p>Qin Chu was silent...</p><p>He could tolerate the fact that she won't let him sleep with her, so he was still good as long as he could touch her and partially satisfy his desires.</p><p>Qin Chu suddenly dove into their bed and began groping Huo Mian...</p><p>\"Ah… Qin Chu, what are you grabbing, stop.\" Huo Mian couldn't stay calm any longer and screamed.</p><p>That night, nothing substantial happened, but Huo Mian was touched all over by Qin Chu.</p><p>It finally balanced out in Mr. Qin's heart...</p><p>He felt like Huo Mian was slowly accepting him and opening her heart up to him.

She would often run over to room five during her night shift and come out looking like a mess. Everyone knows about what happened.\" </p><p>\"Isn't the patient in room five a fifty-year-old man?\" Huo Mian remembered that the man in room five seemed to have been a Thai Chinese who looked like an average Southeast Asian. He was skinny and dark-skinned and spoke improper Mandarin. </p><p>He claimed to have estates in both Thailand and Malaysia and worked in imports and exports. </p><p>\"Yea, so what if he's older, as long as he's got money. That nurse who's close with Wang Tingting said that Thai guy bought a condo for her in a local community, and he even gave her an Audi TT sports car. Seems like he's planning to spoil her.\" </p><p>\"What if that man no longer wants to be with her in the future? Has she considered a way out?\" Huo Mian sighed. </p><p>None of these girls cared about anything else, as long as they had their fun for the time being. </p><p>They would never think of a way out…</p><p>Reasonably speaking, Wang Tingting's salary was already fairly high, and along with bonuses and benefits, she earned six to seven thousand every month. </p><p>Plus, South Side provided accommodation stipends and retirement insurance. If she gave up on all that, and things go downhill with that Thai guy, then all that would go to waste. </p><p>\"How would she think of all that? She just wants to enjoy life one day at a time. Even if she breaks up, she would still have the house and car.\" </p><p>\"Fine, I guess people think differently.\" Huo Mian no longer raised her opinion.</p><p>She wouldn't try to convince Wang Tingting otherwise since everyone had his or her own right to choose. </p><p>As Huo Mian was writing up documents in the office that afternoon, Zhu Lingling sent her a WeChat message. </p><p>\"What happened that day? How long did you guys stay for afterward?\" </p><p>\"We left shortly after you did, no one had the appetite,\" replied Huo Mian. </p><p>\"Is that girl really Gao Ran's girlfriend? She doesn't look so pretty.\" </p><p>\"I thought she looked nice, she's quite cute,\" Huo Mian said intentionally. </p><p>\"Pish, really? Your taste has always been questionable, so I find it hard to believe.\" </p><p>\"Huh? Do I smell something sour? Are you jealous?\" </p><p>\"Jealous? Me? How is that possible? I wouldn't want that Gao Ran even if someone begged me to take him.\" Zhu Lingling fought back. </p><p>\"So, you're not trying to get information out of me by sending me a WeChat message now?\" </p><p>\"Huo Mian, can we still hang out happily?\" Zhu Lingling said reluctantly, as she noticed that her plots were seen through. </p><p>\"Really, I didn't think that girl would be good for Gao Ran either, but it doesn't matter what we say, we still have to see what Gao Ran feels himself.\" Huo Mian calmly analyzed. </p><p>\"Deng Kai came running back, wanting to get back together.

She seemed to have a crush on Su Yu and was trying to seduce him the whole time, but I don't think Su Yu like her.\" </p><p>\"She likes Su Yu? She must be pretty blind.\" Huo Mian laughed lightly. </p><p>Who in the world could stand Su Yu's temper? Just because that Su Yu had a handsome face, did that mean all the girls in the world would put up with his irrational temper, impoliteness, and that arrogant attitude? </p><p>\"Su Yu is nice, I thought he was alright. He's a bit of a playboy, but he does have the asset to allow him to be one. If we grew up their circle, then we would've already had tons of lovers as well. Plus, I heard that Su Yu has always been very generous with women.\" </p><p>\"Say what you want, it just depends on what you value the most, everyone has their own way of putting a value on things.\" Huo Mian smiled, and she no longer argued about Su Yu with Zhu Lingling. </p><p>\"Let's grab dinner when I'm off this week and go shopping.

Take it as a vacation, and don't feel pressured.\" </p><p>Upon hearing what Lisa said, Zhao Qingya immediately grabbed up her phone and tapped her online banking app to check. </p><p>A seven-figure amount was transferred into her account a few minutes ago. </p><p>She was already used to Su Yu's generosity… </p><p>Everyone has some degree of greed within then, and when Zhao Qingya first started dating Su Yu, she was only doing it for the fame and money. </p><p>Back then, Su Yu supported her 100%, and within a year, she was featured in several major films, and later became a well-known A-list star. </p><p>She had all the fame and money she could ever want. Aside from her own earnings from films, Su Yu also bought her several houses and cars, along with countless gold and silver pieces of jewelry as well as watches and bags. </p><p>However, now, she no longer wanted those things... </p><p>She wanted to marry Su Yu and become a member of the Su family… by then she could retire and raise the kids. </p><p>However, she didn't know that the Su family would be that hard to marry into. </p><p>\"Sister Lisa, we've known each other for quite a while now, there's no need to hide things from me. Is President Su dating Mian Mian?\" </p><p>\"Qingya, some things…\" </p><p>\"Just tell me 'yes' or 'no',\" Zhao Qingya interrogated Lisa. </p><p>\"No, he isn't. President Su might have given some extra resources to Mian Mian, but from what I know, there's really nothing between them. President Su seems to be very busy lately, so they barely have any time to see each other\" </p><p>\"Huh… I don't believe you,\" Zhao Qingya sneered. </p><p>\"That bitch, Mian Mian, must have seduced President Su while I was away filming at another city.\" </p><p>\"See, you won't even believe me if I told you the truth. Qingya, just hear me out, you shouldn't be so stubborn, or else you'll only harm yourself.\" </p><p>Lisa left the room after she comforted Zhao Qingya. </p><p>Plenty of fans waited outside the First Hospital for Zhao Qingya to be discharged. </p><p>At the Imperial Star's Shooting Stars and Butterfly Sword press conference that afternoon, the media asked Mian Mian about her relationship with President Su Yu. She smiled without saying anything, and the others didn't know what to think about this response. </p><p>Inside the room, Zhao Qingya was watching the live broadcast on T.V., and she was so mad that she tossed an ashtray over at it, shattering the LED T.V. </p><p>\"Qingya, please calm down, what's the point?\" </p><p>\"I just can't stand it, that woman has gotten plastic surgery all over her face, and she's not special at all. She doesn't deserve to be so famous.\" Zhao Qingya forcefully squashed the cigarette in her hand, and her face turned green with fury. </p><p>\"Qingya, you've been in this industry for a while, why can't you learn to let things go? Who is President Su? Even if Mian Mian didn't exist, there would still be another rising star. Weren't you a newbie when you first entered this industry? Back then, President Su was still dating Annie Liang, but you still took her place.\" </p><p>\"Still, I can't stand it, anyway… I don't like this Mian Mian at all, I have to deal with her.\" </p><p>- Beside a private swimming pool - </p><p>Su Yu had only swum one lap before stepping out of the pool and grabbing a towel to wipe the water off his body.</p><p>\"I hear that you're quite close with that newbie at your company, has your taste changed?\" Wei Liao asked as he pointed to the T.V.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":363,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:55.413","Link":"Chapter-363","NameDisplay":"Chapter 363"},{"ID":181120950559407564,"Name":"Chapter 364: Oh She's Already Married (6)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 364: Oh She's Already Married (6)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 364: Oh She's Already Married (6)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated  Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Before Su Yu could say anything, Tang Chuan hurriedly said, \"I'm surprised that you couldn't see right through this... It's very clear that Mian Mian is only a distraction, President Su placed her in front of all the press and public so she can become the cannon fodder. He's doing this to protect the person he really cares about.\" </p><p>\"Ohh… look at you all high and mighty, Big Boy Su,\" laughed Wei Liao. </p><p>\"Do you want me to call the funeral home? I'm sure they'd like to carry two sets of corpses away from my swimming pool,\" Su Yu coldly threatened. </p><p>Wei Liao and Tang Chuan immediately shut up… </p><p>- That night, at a high-end bar - </p><p>Like always, a bunch of people was drinking, and Mian Mian came into the room in a pink mini-skirt and red hat.</p><p>She directly sat beside Su Yu, and poured him a glass of wine while putting on a show of good behavior. </p><p>Su Yu occasionally looked at his phone, without any expressions on his face. His heart was someplace else </p><p>\"President Su…\" </p><p>\"What?\" Su Yu didn't even look up. </p><p>\"Qingya seems to have wronged me for something, she's getting all the other celebrities in our company to bully me. I feel terribly mistreated... President Su, please help me.\" </p><p>\"If you feel mistreated, then don't be a celebrity, just leave the company. You really shouldn't be an entertainer if you're this sensitive.\" </p><p>President Su still didn't look at her; instead, he flipped through Huo Mian's Weibo (TL note: Chinese Twitter). </p><p>A while ago, Weibo was getting quite popular, so Huo Mian got herself an account, but she didn't post on it too often. </p><p>She would only occasionally post or repost things when she had the time. </p><p>Her account name was quite cute, called the 'Penguin of Madagascar'. </p><p>However, Su Yu still managed to find her despite her online alias. After all, his people were quite resourceful. </p><p>He couldn't get her Wechat, but he could still follow her on Weibo. </p><p>Su Yu was a super V level user on Weibo, with over thirty million followers. </p><p>Plus, most of his followers were real account users, and even so, he had more followers than a lot of celebrities. </p><p>His name was also verified on Weibo, and his identity was the President of Imperial Star Entertainment and a board member of Su Financial Bank. </p><p>However, Su Yu was a lazy man who rarely used Weibo. He wouldn't even let his team take care of his account, because he thought that it defeated the purpose of having a Weibo account. </p><p>The last time he went on Weibo was a month ago when he reposted the new movie, Tale of the God of Gamblers, which his company collaborated with a Hong Kong company to make had been released. But even so, he received eighty thousand comments in one day.  </p><p>Most of the commenters were delusional female fans that screamed out, \"Hubby, you've finally updated your Weibo!\" </p><p>\"Hubby, we'll definitely support your new movie, even if it's bad.\" </p><p>\"Hubby, post more selfies and share it with us.\" </p><p>Each and every one of them screamed out hubby and hubby again, and just like that, Su Yu became 'the husband of the people'. </p><p>Of course, this had to do with his face, since amongst the wealthy men, only a few were both handsome AND rich. </p><p>The heir of GK Corporation rarely showed his face, so hardly anyone followed him, whereas Su Yu was much more high-profile. </p><p>Even if a new girl was seen around him, the entertainment outlets would report about it for an entire week… </p><p>After he found Huo Mian's Weibo, Su Yu didn't follow her right away, because he feared that the netizens might see it. </p><p>He would only open up her Weibo and flip through each post. If he found something amusing he would laugh… </p><p>If he found something immature or cringey, he would also burst into laughter. Either way, Su Yu was having fun playing with his phone. </p><p>He didn't care about what Mian Mian was complaining about in her feud with Zhao Qingya. </p><p>\"President Su, did I do something wrong?\" Mian Mian wanted to cry, but no tears came out and she was just looking pitiful. </p><p>Finally, Su Yu put away his phone and, shooting a glance at her as he tilted his head, he asked, \"Why do you ask?\" </p><p>\"Everyone out there says that there's something between us, but the truth is, there's nothing… Yet, I still have to deal with all the suspicion and curses, it's really a lot of pressure. So, I was wondering if I did something wrong that offended you.\" Mian Mian wasn't dumb, so she was able to analyze the situation clearly.</p><p>\"Then do you think that you did anything wrong that offended me?\" Amused, Su Yu looked at her</p><p>(TL: We are very close to making a video that gives you an in-depth view of how spirit stones work, and how you can get the most every day.

If you want to succeed in this industry, then don’t worry about these unnecessary things. Just play your part well and memorize your lines properly, because putting in your full effort is the only thing that matters. Remember, there’s no shortcut to success.”</p><p>“President Su, I actually….” Unwilling to give up, Mian Mian slid up to him.</p><p>She tried to move closer to Su Yu…</p><p>Su Yu immediately stood up and shouted as he pointed not far away, “Give me the mic, I know this song the best.”</p><p>After Su Yu spoke, he took the microphone and started singing…</p><p>Mian Mian was awkwardly set to the side….</p><p>Just then, Tang Chuan came over covered in the stench of alcohol and placed his arm around Mian Mian. He said, “Your president hasn’t been in a sexy mood recently, don’t waste your feelings on him. You should date me, I’ll treat you better than he ever would.”</p><p>“Haha… Young Master Tang, you’re being funny.” Mian Mian awkwardly smiled, and then stood up to say goodbye to Wei Liao and Tang Chuan.</p><p>“Ahem… Su Yu really is becoming classier, he won’t even sleep with someone who’s more than willing to crawl into his bed. Even though that chick has a lot of work done to her face, her figure is alright. It’d make me happy if I could have my way with her,” Tang Chuan shook his head and exclaimed.</p><p>“Su Yu is full of pride, he won’t sleep with just anyone. His temper is rotten as well, so please don’t cause more trouble for us.” Wei Liao drank as he watched Su Yu sing a song that he wasn’t familiar with.</p><p>After Mian Mian left, Su Yu stayed around with them for a while, but later realized that he wasn’t in the mood.</p><p>Su Yu’s Black Sesto Elemento Lamborghini Sixth Element was his favorite…</p><p>It was a rare limited edition car that was seen in the movie Need for Speed, and it was very cool. (TL Note: IMDb Rating: 6.5 out of 10, yeeeet)</p><p>It also suited Su Yu’s flashy personality…</p><p>He drove his black Lamborghini into the night and parked it outside the entrance of South Side Recuperation Center.</p><p>Ever since Huo Mian was promoted to Head Nurse, she didn’t work as many night shifts as she used to.</p><p>She would occasionally work one night shift for three days every two weeks, so it was relatively more relaxing.</p><p>Master Qin was also quite satisfied with this schedule as well.</p><p>Tonight, while Huo Mian was working the night shift, she suddenly received a delivery.</p><p>“I’m looking for a Ms. Huo Mian.”</p><p>“That’s me.” Huo Mian raised her hand.</p><p>“Hi, this is your delivery.”</p><p>“Uhm…” Huo Mian knew that she didn’t order anything online, so why would she suddenly receive a package?</p><p>When she saw how tightly packed the package was, she was worried that it might be an explosive device sent by terrorists.</p><p>“Why won’t you open it, Head Nurse?”</p><p>“Uhm… I’m afraid that it’s a bomb.”</p><p>“Maybe you’re worrying too much.” The nurse who was working the same shift as her was speechless.</p><p>Why else would they call the head nurse an abnormal woman? Even her logic was odd. Under normal circumstances, wouldn’t a woman be pleasantly surprised when they receive a package, and then guess who it was from?</p><p>Why would the head nurse think that a package would contain explosives just because she received it at night? What a weirdo.</p><p>Under the nurse’s encouragement, Huo Mian opened the package, finding it to be filled with late night snacks.</p><p>What a scare…</p><p>Plus it was a strange meal; because it wasn’t congee or bubble tea; it was smoked pork hock, chicken feet, sausages, and a few buns. It smelled delicious, but it seemed inappropriate to eat all this so late at night.</p><p>“Head Nurse, this is so considerate, it must be from your boyfriend.” The nurse was overwhelmed with envy.</p><p>Huo Mian knew that this definitely wasn’t Qin Chu’s doing, because Mr. Qin would personally deliver the food, and then stick around and try to take advantage of her.</p><p>“Could it be…?” Huo Mian thought of a person, but she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>Huo Mian only came into contact with so many people, and her social circle was small, so hardly anyone she knew would send her a midnight snack like this.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":365,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:56.52","Link":"chapter-365-oh-she-s-already-married-7-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 365 - Oh She's Already Married (7)"},{"ID":181120950569848994,"Name":"Chapter 366 - Oh She's Already Married (8)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 366 - Oh She's Already Married (8)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 366: Oh She’s Already Married (8)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Head Nurse, don’t worry, just eat.

Thanks, Head Nurse.”</p><p>Then, the nurse happily carried the midnight snacks into the office…</p><p>Bored, Huo Mian scrolled through her WeChat friend circle; the hospital was rather quiet today.</p><p>Then, she logged onto Weibo, which she hadn’t been on in a while and noticed that someone she didn’t know had sent her a private message.</p><p>“Are the pig feet good?”</p><p>It was sent three minutes ago – the person who sent it had a ‘verified’ tag on his profile; it was the President of Imperial Star, Su Yu.</p><p>“So it really was you who sent me the food?” Huo Mian answered with a question of her own.</p><p>“Why? Are you surprised?”</p><p>“Surprised my a*s, what are you trying to do to me? I can’t believe you would send me pork feet in the middle of the night… I bet you have an ulterior motive.”</p><p>“I heard that pig and chicken feet can help you grow your cup size. Looking at your figure… yup, it’ll be good for you.”</p><p>“Su Yu, I dare you to come over here. I promise I won’t kill you.” Huo Mian’s expression darkened.</p><p>What was wrong with her figure? Why would she want giant boobs? She wasn’t a cow, for god’s sake.</p><p>She waited a while, but Su Yu didn’t reply…</p><p>She thought that she had scared him off, but just as she was about to log off of Weibo, he sent her another private message.</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t know how to reply to a message like this one, so she decided to log off without replying.</p><p>It didn’t matter if Su Yu was serious towards her or not; she didn’t care. She already had Qin Chu and therefore didn’t want to be involved with anyone else.</p><p>Su Yu leaned on the driver’s seat of his black Lamborghini, parked outside the South Side Recuperation Center. He was silent</p><p>He was disappointed that Huo Mian didn’t reply to him, but it was also expected…</p><p>After sitting in his car for a little longer, Su Yu drove away…</p><p>The Su Family’s old mansion was located at Golden Coast; it faced the ocean and had trees and flowers growing everywhere amidst the spring air.</p><p>This area was a well-known upper-class district, and because it was home to many military leaders, the security was tight and ordinary residents were not allowed to come and go as they wished.</p><p>Su Yu’s father and the other members of his family worked in the banking industry, so they were on business trips 11 out of the 12 months in a year.</p><p>Su Yu’s grandfather, who was a military leader, also traveled all over the world.</p><p>Therefore, most of the time Mrs. Su was the only one at home…</p><p>Apparently, Su Yu’s mother was born of modest background, but Su Yu’s father fell in love with her, and his entire family treated her with great respect.</p><p>Mrs. Su was about to go to bed when she heard her son come home in the middle of the night. She immediately put on a jacket and asked the chef to make him some ginseng soup.</p><p>“Mom… I don’t like this stuff, it tastes like medicine.”</p><p>“It’s good for your body.” Mrs. Su couldn’t help but nag.</p><p>Under her mother’s watch, Su Yu had no choice but to drink the soup that her mother ordered the chef to make.</p><p>“Son, why are you home in the middle of the night? If you had called, I would have made you some food.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s okay, I just ate. I’m not hungry, I missed you all of a sudden, so I decided to come home.”</p><p>“Yu…” Mrs. Su’s face filled with motherly love.</p><p>“Mom, I wanted to ask your advice about something.”</p><p>“About what?

Why would she block me?”</p><p>“Are you sure she blocked you and didn’t delete you?”</p><p>“What’s the difference?” Gao Ran sent her another crying emoji.</p><p>“If she blocked you, it means you did something to piss her off and she wants you to know that she’s rejecting your messages for now.

Maybe she got herself a new boyfriend, and he is the jelly type.”</p><p>“Do you think that’s possible?” Gao Ran became a little worried at what Qin Chu said.</p><p>“Of course it is, flight attendants always have a lot of suitors.”</p><p>“Why would anyone want to date Zhu Lingling? She’s so mean.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be so sure.” Qin Chu slowly took a sip of his wine.</p><p>Gao Ran became even more depressed after hearing what Qin Chu said….</p><p>“Can you ask your wife to come and join us for dinner after work?” Gao Ran thought, as long as Huo Mian was here, Zhu Lingling was definitely going to show up. After all, they were best friends.</p><p>“She’s working night shifts these days.”</p><p>“What a shame.” Gao Ran was slightly disappointed.</p><p>The truth was, Qin Chu knew how Gao Ran felt about Zhu Lingling a long time ago, but since Gao Ran didn’t want to admit it, he didn’t blow the cover for him.</p><p>When Gao Ran went to the bathroom, Qin Chu sent Huo Mian a WeChat message.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m eating, the food at the cafeteria sucks. I can’t believe I’m spending 50 yuan a day for lunch on this crap!”</p><p>“I can ask someone to bring you lunch in the future. The chefs are GK make pretty good food.”</p><p>“No, I don’t want to seem so spoiled. If everyone else can eat it, so can I. If anything, I’ll eat less at work and cook when I get home.”</p><p>“Good girl.” Qin Chu sent her a head-patting emoji.</p><p>“What about you? Are you finished with work? I won’t be home tonight, so remember to make yourself some food.”</p><p>“I’m with Gao Ran.”</p><p>“Oh yeah, you guys are together? Is he complaining to you about how Zhu Lingling blocked him?” Huo Mian laughed.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Hahaha, Lingling is weird too, why block him? I bet Gao Ran lost his cool.”</p><p>“Yeah, he’s all over the place.”</p><p>“Keep him at bay, I’ll ask Lingling what happened.”</p><p>“Gao Ran broke up with that girlfriend of his.”</p><p>“That fast?” Huo Mian knew that they wouldn’t be together forever, but was still surprised at how short it lasted.</p><p>After some more chitchat with Qin Chu, Zhu Lingling called her back…</p><p>“Hey, I just got off the plane and saw your phone call. What’s up?” Zhu Lingling held her phone with one hand and pulled on her luggage with the other, looking like a full-on iron lady.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":368,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:58.157","Link":"chapter-368-oh-she-s-already-married-10-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 368 - Oh She's Already Married (10)"},{"ID":181120950586246769,"Name":"Chapter 369 -  I Hate How Rational You Are (1)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 369 -  I Hate How Rational You Are (1)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 369: I Hate How Rational You Are (1)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Gao Ran told me that you blocked his WeChat.”</p><p>“Yeah, is that a problem?” Zhu Lingling asked matter-of-factly.</p><p>“Of course not; Gao Ran couldn’t reach you, so he came asking me what happened. Why are you guys fighting?”</p><p>“We’re not, I just don’t like looking at him.”</p><p>“Then you should’ve blocked him a long time ago, why did you do it after his girlfriend barged into our lunch session? Hey, do you have a thing for our people’s police?”</p><p>“Bullsh*t, I don’t have a thing for him.” Zhu Lingling immediately denied it.</p><p>“Fine, keep at it.”</p><p>“Anyways, it’ll take me a while to explain what happened between us.

I’ve been in a crappy mood lately and want to talk to you about it.”</p><p>“Yeah, sounds good, but not too early though, I need to nap first. Let’s meet up at lunch, call me after you make reservations.”</p><p>“Why am I making the reservations? Aren’t you treating?” Zhu Lingling asked on purpose.</p><p>“Of course I’m treating, but you can still pick the restaurant.”</p><p>“Gosh, indeed dripping with cash and swag, Mrs. Moneybags, please let me aboard your ship.” Zhu Lingling laughed.</p><p>“Wait, Gao Ran’s ship is much better, you should join his instead. I heard that he broke up with his girlfriend and is currently looking for a shipmate.”</p><p>“They broke up? Yeah right.” Zhu Lingling obviously didn’t believe her.</p><p>“Qin Chu told me, and he never lies. I can guarantee it.”</p><p>“But why would they break up?” Zhu Lingling was curious.</p><p>“You will have to ask Gao Ran yourself, haha.”</p><p>“I’m too lazy to talk to him. Anyways, I’ll see you tomorrow.” Then, Zhu Lingling hung up the phone.</p><p>After dinner, Huo Mian realized that she still had half an hour before work, so she went back to her office to organize some documents.</p><p>Then, she headed to rounds to inspect the patients in every room.</p><p>Just then, her phone rang; it was a video call.</p><p>“Hi, Master Qin.” Huo Mian smiled after picking up.</p><p>She was wearing her usual white uniform, black rimmed glasses, and didn’t have on even a speck of makeup. She looked clean and pretty.</p><p>Qin Chu, on the other side, was still at the office. He had on a navy blue shirt, and his face was as gorgeous as it always was.</p><p>“Are you busy?”</p><p>“No, I just had dinner and was about to go on rounds.”</p><p>“What did you have for dinner?”</p><p>“Um… let me think, I think I had braised ribs, seaweed with potato slices, and tomato egg soup.”</p><p>“It wasn’t good, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s always been like that, the chefs have made zero improvements. What about you? Have you eaten?”</p><p>“I’m still at work.”</p><p>“Whenever I work night shifts, you work overtime.” Huo Mian asked with a smile.</p><p>“What’s the point of going home anyway? It’s not like you’re there.”</p><p>“I’ll try to make it back early tomorrow morning and cook you a delicious breakfast.”</p><p>“No, you are already exhausted from work. I’ll make breakfast, what do you want to eat?”</p><p>“Fried eggs and sandwiches, how does that sound? I saw a little kid eating some in the hall, and my mouth almost watered.”</p><p>“Is that all you’ve got?” Qin Chu laughed.</p><p>“You know that I can’t control myself in front of food.”</p><p>“Okay, fried eggs and sandwiches it is. See you tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“Okay, bye.”</p><p>After she hung up, Huo Mian picked up the charts and went on rounds…</p><p>Surprisingly, she saw Wang Tingting, who quit not so long ago, in room 5. This time, she came as the patient’s family.</p><p>She was wearing a low V-neck and had on a thick layer of makeup. She leaned on that Thai patient intimately.</p><p>“Hi, my dearest Head Nurse.” Wang Tingting smiled proudly when she saw Huo Mian come in.</p><p>(TL Note: Today, we will be thanking our news reporter-level fans that are supporting us on Patreon.

Does it hurt anywhere?” Huo Mian asked the Thai patient as a formality.</p><p>“Not too bad, but my chest feels stuffy at times. Can you do anything about that?”</p><p>“It’s probably because you’ve been cooped up in this room this whole time, and the ventilation isn’t that good. I suggest that your friend take you on short walks in the back garden. Exercise is good for your recovery.”</p><p>“Okay, thanks, Head Nurse.” The Thai patient was polite; aside from the fact that he was a little bit of a pervert.</p><p>Huo Mian glanced at Tingting and reminded her, “He has diabetes, make sure you control what he eats. Don’t let him have too much sweet fruit.”</p><p>“I know that, you don’t have to remind me. I’m his girlfriend, of course, I know him well.”</p><p>“That’s for the best.” Huo Mian smiled. Then, she turned on her heel and left.</p><p>“I hate how she thinks she’s almighty and always pretends to be super-rational…” Wang Tingting cursed at Huo Mian as she walked away.</p><p>“Sweetie, are you talking about the head nurse? She seems like a good person who is good at her job.”</p><p>“What do you know? She’s awful, we all hate her,” Wang Tingting spat furiously.</p><p>Speaking of South Side Recuperation Center, it was true that not a lot of people liked Huo Mian. Why?</p><p>Because she proposed a reorganization of South Side and made nurses change out of their sexy uniforms and into all-white uniforms.</p><p>She also proposed that all nurses and doctors be tested on their skills, forcing them to up their game.</p><p>The lives of those who weren’t that good at their jobs and just wanted to get by became harder, and therefore they all secretly hated Huo Mian.</p><p>However, Huo Mian wasn’t worried; she was working at a hospital, so it should operate like a hospital.</p><p>The good thing was, Director Wu was smart enough to approve her proposals. Some bad habits still lingered, but South Side was officially reorganized.</p><p>Overall, the hospital improved quite a bit and so did its reputation.</p><p>After her night shift, it was already 7:30 AM when Huo Mian arrived at home.</p><p>Qin Chu was already awake and was making her breakfast.</p><p>“You’re home? Go wash your hands, I’ll make you some fried eggs.” Qin Chu was waiting for Huo Mian to come home so that the food wouldn’t become cold.</p><p>Huo Mian was touched as she watched Qin Chu working in the kitchen…</p><p>How many women were lucky enough to meet a man who was willing to cook for her?</p><p>Especially when this man was always super busy managing a billion-dollar company.</p><p>That’s why it could be said that those who always say they are too busy were actually secretly telling you that you aren’t the most important person to them.</p><p>It meant that he didn’t care about what you cared about; at least not yet.</p><p>Soon, Qin Chu finished cooking. He walked out of the kitchen with the eggs and carefully placed the plate in front of Huo Mian.</p><p>“Try it, is it overcooked?”</p><p>“Of course not, it looks delicious.”</p><p>“Thanks, little as*kisser.” Qin Chu smiled.</p><p>The only time he smiled like this was when he was with Huo Mian.</p><p>When he was at work or outside, others always thought of him as the ‘Iceberg’ president.</p><p>Qin Chu wasn’t a man of many words, but each word he spoke was straight to the point. During the executive meetings, he only needed a few sentences to address the crowd and conclude the meeting.</p><p>Huo Mian’s heart filled with warmth as she gobbled down a fried egg…</p><p>Qin Chu poured her a glass of warm milk.</p><p>“Take a nap, there’s a steam eye mask by the bed.”</p><p>“Okay.” Huo Mian nodded goofily as she ate.</p><p>After they enjoyed breakfast together, Qin Chu gathered his stuff and headed out the door.</p><p>“Don’t drive too fast and be careful, Mr. Qin.” Huo Mian waved her hand.</p><p>Qin Chu took a few steps out the door before suddenly remembering something. He turned around to ask, “Mian, do you know Su Yu?”</p><p>Huo Mian’s expression changed slightly upon hearing his question…</p><p>( TL Note: Wow the author’s setting up such a high standard for us guys… Bros, don’t let your gf read this, or you would be compared to Qin Chu for all of eternity.</p><p>“Honey, why are you saying you are busy?

I used to administer his IVs every day, why do you ask?”</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t lie and told Qin Chu up front…</p><p>“Nothing, I was just wondering.” He nodded and turned around to go to work.</p><p>Huo Mian took a hot shower, put on the eye mask, and fell into deep sleep.</p><p>At around 11:20 AM, Zhu Lingling’s call came in.</p><p>“Get up, I’m at Cherry Blossom Japanese Cuisine on Changqing Street.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll be right there.” Huo Mian got up in a daze. She then took a shower and drove right over.</p><p>She arrived in less than 20 minutes.</p><p>Zhu Lingling had already ordered a table full of food and was waiting for her.</p><p>After the two of them wolfed everything down, Zhu Lingling suggested that they go shopping, and Huo Mian happily agreed.</p><p>To their surprise, they ran into Lin Xuejiao at the mall.</p><p>She immediately went up to greet Huo Mian, “Hey guys.”</p><p>“What a coincidence, you’re here as well?” Huo Mian replied with a smile.</p><p>“Yeah, did Gao Ran tell you what happened between us?” Lin Xuejiao asked straight away.</p><p>Huo Mian and Zhu Lingling looked at each other; Huo Mian nodded, “Oh yeah, I kind of heard.”</p><p>“Do you know why we broke up?” Lin Xuejiao seemed to be asking Huo Mian, but in reality, her gaze was on Zhu Lingling.</p><p>“I don’t know, Gao Ran didn’t say, so we didn’t ask.”</p><p>“Gao Ran comes from a family of high-level officials who are really strict about who marries into their family. I thought that I would be good enough for him, but Gao Ran’s mother told me that she wouldn’t let anyone who wasn’t a virgin marry her son. I had a boyfriend before so… Anyway, forget about that. I hope Gao Ran can be happy. Have fun shopping, guys, see you next time.”</p><p>Lin Xuejiao left as soon as she finished speaking… leaving Huo Mian and Zhu Lingling standing there, flabbergasted…</p><p>After Zhu Lingling heard what Lin Xuejiao said, she commented sourly, “What year is this? Gao Ran’s mom sure is weird, setting up standards like this for her daughter-in-law. She might as well go look for one at a kindergarten.”</p><p>“Lin Xuejiao’s really weird, why would she tell us all that?” Huo Mian wondered why Lin Xuejiao acted this way.</p><p>She didn’t think that they were close enough to talk about such an intimate topic, but she did anyway.</p><p>Lin Xuejiao didn’t seem to be a brainless oaf who spoke whatever was on her mind either.</p><p>She must’ve had an ulterior motive to this…</p><p>Huo Mian thought with her head down…</p><p>“Let’s not stand here, let’s go.”</p><p>She pulled Huo Mian away, and the two of them proceeded with an afternoon’s worth of shopping.</p><p>Finally, they had some afternoon tea before Zhu Lingling finally let Huo Mian go home.</p><p>As soon as Huo Mian got home, she received another WeChat message from Gao Ran…</p><p>“Huo Mian, did you ask Zhu Lingling what’s going on? Even a criminal sentenced to death has to know why. I don’t get it, it’s so weird.”</p><p>Huo Mian thought about it for a while and replied to him with another question, “Why did you break up with Lin Xuejiao?”</p><p>“I told you, our personalities weren’t compatible.”</p><p>“What about your parents? Was your mom not happy with her or something?” Huo Mian asked carefully.</p><p>“Mian, are you kidding me? My mom would die of happiness if I got married tomorrow and gave her a grandchild the day after. She doesn’t care who I date, and I’m beginning to suspect that she doesn’t care about the gender too.”</p><p>“Oh, then I get it.”</p><p>“What did you get?” Gao Ran was confused.</p><p>“Nothing…I’ll ask Lingling again when I have the chance. Stay calm.”</p><p>“How am I supposed to stay calm? I don’t even know what’s happening…” Gao Ran seemed to be agitated.</p><p>However, Huo Mian had no choice but to stop replying to him…</p><p>As she turned off her phone, Huo Mian was sure of one thing: Lin Xuejiao was a calculating b*tch.</p><p>She seemed to have found out the interesting relationship between Zhu Lingling and Gao Ran and wanted to screw it up.</p><p>She thought about it long and hard and finally decided to help Gao Ran out. She sent Lingling a WeChat message, “Lingling, unblock Gao Ran. You shouldn’t stay mad at him.”</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":371,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:50:59.673","Link":"chapter-371-i-hate-how-rational-you-are-3-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 371 - I Hate How Rational You Are (3)"},{"ID":18112095102466180,"Name":"Chapter 372 - I Hate How Rational You Are (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 372 - I Hate How Rational You Are (4)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 372: I Hate How Rational You Are (4)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Mian, you don’t know what happened, it’s not as simple as you think.”</p><p>“Oh? Did something happen between you two that I don’t know about?” Huo Mian pretended to be surprised.</p><p>“Ahem… of course not, don’t overthink it.”</p><p>“Okay, well I’ve done everything I can, and you can decide whether you want to unblock him. However… don’t listen to what Lin Xuejiao said, she’s not what she seems to be and she might have said all that on purpose.”</p><p>After Huo Mian reminded Zhu Lingling, she finally relaxed. Then, she gathered her things and headed to her third nightshift of the week.</p><p>It was the afternoon rush hour, so traffic was jammed. Huo Mian played some music in her car.</p><p>She was enjoying the music when she suddenly felt like someone was looking at her.</p><p>Then, she noticed that a black Lamborghini was parked right next to her car…</p><p>Aside from Su Yu, who else could its driver be?</p><p>But this time, Su Yu didn’t purposely create this chance encounter; he was going to lunch with some clients, and the restaurant was nearby.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect to see Huo Mian while waiting for a red light; this was truly a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Therefore, his gaze never left her…</p><p>It wasn’t until the lights changed and the cars behind him began honking that Su Yu was drawn back to reality…</p><p>Afterward, he glanced back at where Huo Mian was, but she was already gone.</p><p>It was already past dinner time when she arrived at South Side. She was wondering if she should order delivery when a nurse suddenly came up to her and said in a hurry, “Head Nurse, Deputy Director Guo asked you to go to his office.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Huo Mian nodded; then, she changed into her white uniform, put on her glasses, and headed up to the top floor, where the deputy director’s office was.</p><p>She knocked before entering, and to her surprise, she saw Huo Siqian.</p><p>He was wearing a beige T-shirt and a Cartier bangle.</p><p>He seemed to be discussing something with the deputy director…</p><p>“Hey, look who we have here?” Huo Siqian smiled when he saw Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian ignored them and went up to Deputy Director Guo, “You were looking for me?”</p><p>“Hey, Huo, come and sit down.”</p><p>“Deputy Director, I haven’t had dinner yet, could you let me know why you were looking for me?”</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t want to waste time with them…</p><p>“Don’t worry about dinner, we haven’t eaten either, we can have dinner together in a bit. Sit down, listen to what President Huo is offering to our hospital as a reward system.”</p><p>“A reward system for our hospital? Since when does an outsider have the right to do that?” Huo Mian faintly asked.</p><p>“Hey, don’t say that. President Huo isn’t an outsider, he’s our hospital’s biggest sponsor.”</p><p>Huo Mian, “…”</p><p>Fine, the deputy director loved money, and she was at a loss for words.</p><p>“Mian, I established an emergency care foundation for your hospital, so in the future, when less fortunate people come looking for emergency treatment, the hospital will be able to help them. The Huo Foundation will take care of the bills.”</p><p>“Are you trying to be Robin Hood now?” Huo Mian looked at Huo Siqian and asked.</p><p>“No no no, I’m not, that’ll be too tiring. I was hoping that you could become a board member of the Huo Foundation and help deal with this stuff. I told the deputy director to double your salary since you’ll have to work your shifts and manage the foundation at the same time.”</p><p>The truth was, Huo Mian wanted to say no. However, what Huo Siqian was doing was quite meaningful.</p><p>A lot of the local residents, thinking that this place was a hospital, came looking for emergency care without knowing that they were only a recuperation center.</p><p>In the end, the hospital refused to treat them and had to send them away. If Huo Siqian was really willing to offer the money, they would be able to hire some on-call doctors for their emergency room. They might be able to save a lot of lives.</p><p>Huo Mian was not about to decline an opportunity like this, even though she didn’t know what Huo Siqian’s ulterior motive was.</p><p>Plus, this was a really good deed…</p><p>“Huo Mian, what do you think?” Deputy Director Guo asked her.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":372,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:00.247","Link":"chapter-372-i-hate-how-rational-you-are-4-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 372 - I Hate How Rational You Are (4)"},{"ID":18112095106884403,"Name":"Chapter 373 - I Hate How Rational You Are (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 373 - I Hate How Rational You Are (5)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 373: I Hate How Rational You Are (5)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Sounds good.” Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>“See? I told you our Huo Mian was going to agree.”</p><p>“May I please leave now, Deputy Director?”</p><p>“Hey, what’s the hurry, Little Sister? I haven’t eaten yet, and I heard your cafeteria isn’t bad, can you take me there for dinner?”</p><p>“I…” Huo Mian wanted to decline.</p><p>But Deputy Director said, “Of course she can, you donated so much. Of course Huo Mian would agree to something like this.”</p><p>Huo Mian had no choice but to swallow her words…</p><p>She took Huo Siqian to the cafeteria. Dinner hours were already over, so the deputy director ordered the chefs to especially whip up some dishes for Huo Siqian.</p><p>Huo Mian and Huo Siqian sat across from each other in the giant, empty cafeteria.</p><p>“I’m curious, why are you doing this?”</p><p>“I’m just trying to do a good deed.” Huo Siqian chuckled.</p><p>“I don’t believe you, a sly businessman would never do anything that doesn’t benefit him.”</p><p>“Tsk tsk… I like how smart you are. I love that you’re always calm and rational.”</p><p>“Don’t beat around the bush, shoot.”</p><p>“Little Sis, I’m hungry. Can we talk while we eat?” Huo Siqian begged her with puppy dog eyes.</p><p>Just then, the servers brought up six dishes and a soup – stir-fried mushrooms, sweet and sour pork ribs, braised fish, bitter melon and egg stir fry, boiled shrimp, braised meatballs, and sweet and sour soup.</p><p>Before Huo Mian could say anything, Huo Siqian put a shrimp in her bowl.</p><p>“I seem to remember… that you like seafood.” Huo Siqian put down his chopsticks and smiled at Huo Mian.</p><p>“How did you know?” Huo Mian doesn’t remember ever eating with Huo Siqian; how did he know what she liked?</p><p>“Haha, I made a guess.”</p><p>“I don’t buy it.”</p><p>Huo Mian never believed what Huo Siqian said because he always acted like that.</p><p>He always seemed to be smiling on the surface, but who knew what kind of evil was cooking in that brain of his?</p><p>“Is this what you guys usually eat?”</p><p>“We usually have one meat dish, one veggie dish, and a soup. Never as lavish as today.”</p><p>“I feel bad for you.”</p><p>“Why? It’s what everyone eats.” Huo Mian didn’t think it was a big deal.</p><p>This was the first time Huo Siqian had the chance to dine with Huo Mian, so he seemed to treasure this opportunity very much.</p><p>Right after Huo Mian finished a shrimp, he immediately picked up his chopsticks and put another one in her bowl.</p><p>He even used a pair of unused ones; Huo Mian could tell that he was someone who paid attention to little details.</p><p>“Did Dad talk to you about Su Yu?”</p><p>“Yeah, but his ideas aren’t realistic. I would never date Su Yu, so I don’t need any help from the Huo family.”</p><p>“I think Su Yu… is more than just a little interested in you. You should be careful.”</p><p>“Be careful of what? It’s not like he would hurt me.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be so sure; Su Yu can be really aggressive sometimes and will take any measures to get what he wants.”</p><p>“Do you automatically assume that all people are like you?” Huo Mian looked up and asked him quietly.</p><p>Huo Siqian smiled bitterly, “What’s wrong with me?

Don’t think you can trick me, I’ve known you for a while,” Huo Mian said as she slowly ate her food.</p><p>She met Huo Siqian the same year she met Qin Chu. He was in a higher grade than her.</p><p>Although they didn’t interact much, she was aware of his style…</p><p>He never followed the rules and always surprised people with his actions. In a nutshell, he was always calculative behind others’ backs.</p><p>This was why Huo Mian always avoided him all these years…</p><p>Huo Yanyan and Huo Siyi probably both took a lot of emotional beatings from him.</p><p>“Why don’t you tell me what kind of person I am?” Huo Siqian asked with a smile.</p><p>“You already have the answer to that.”</p><p>Huo Siqian, “…”</p><p>“Then, Little Sis, tell me this, okay? Who do you like more, me or Qin Chu?”</p><p>（TL Note: This is called projection in Psychology, where Huo Siqian projects how he would behave onto Su Yu, thinking that everyone would behave like him.

How can you compare to Qin Chu??</p><p>However, Huo Mian was a good girl who never swore (TL Note: you sure about dat?), especially at a serious place like South Side.</p><p>Finally, she looked up at Huo Siqian and answered his question with a question of her own, “I’d like to know who gave you the courage to ask me a question like this?”</p><p>“Just because people all think one way, it doesn’t mean that’s the right answer. I’d rather give it a try because there’s always a chance for another answer.”</p><p>“No, there isn’t another answer. You cannot compare to Qin Chu. No one on this world can compare to Qin Chu,” Huo Mian said directly, without beating around the bush.</p><p>“Tsk tsk… my foolish little sister sure is infatuated.”</p><p>“This has nothing to do with me being infatuated or not. It’s the truth.”</p><p>“Fine, I hope that brat Qin Chu never lets you down. If he ends up shattering your heart into pieces one day… I’d feel hurt as well.”</p><p>“Thanks for your kind remarks, but that will never happen.”</p><p>After an unhappy dinner with Huo Siqian, Huo Mian returned to her post.</p><p>Huo Siqian also left South Side with his assistant. She wondered what this man’s ultimate goal was. Why did he keep coming to South Side and offering things like donations and genetic research funding? Did he have too much money on his hands?</p><p>It didn’t seem like something Huo Siqian would do…</p><p>After another night shift, Huo Mian took another day off. However, she didn’t rest at home because without Qin Chu there with her, she was bored. Therefore, she decided to visit the First Hospital.</p><p>This was her first job after graduation; truth be told, even after she left, she still had feelings for this place.</p><ul><li>Outside the First Hospital’s OB/GYN Clinic –</li></ul><p>“Oh my gosh, Sister Mian… why are you here?” Huang Yue hugged Huo Mian, warmly welcoming her.</p><p>After Huo Mian left, Huang Yue, unwilling to work at the lab, asked the head nurse if she could be transferred back.</p><p>Coincidently, the department was also in need of helping hands, so the higher-ups approved it…</p><p>Ever since Huo Mian left, she rarely came to visit. After all, Wu Xiaoxue was in this department, and they used to be enemies.</p><p>Therefore, she didn’t want to come all the way here just to get an egg thrown into her face…</p><p>“Hey, I had today off and didn’t have anything to do, so I decided to come and see you guys.”</p><p>Huo Mian handed her a bag full of drinks and fruits for everyone in the department.</p><p>“You bought so much! Thanks, Sister Mian.”</p><p>As she was chatting with Huang Yue, Head Nurse Xu Yan came in. She was in a good mood upon seeing Huo Mian.</p><p>“Why are you here?”</p><p>“I have today off, so I wanted to come to see you guys.”</p><p>“Come in, sit down.” Xu Yan held onto Huo Mian’s hand as they walked into the clinic together.</p><p>A few of the other nurses that she was close with also gathered around to join their conversation.</p><p>“Mian, South Side’s work environment is really good, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s for the benefit of the recovering patients. There’s a garden, and the environment and greeneries are great.”</p><p>“That’s great! It must be relaxing to work there.”</p><p>“Not really, patients in recovery usually need our utmost attention and care.” Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>“You’re a head nurse too now and don’t have to do that many night shifts. How does that feel?”</p><p>“Pretty great, haha.” Huo Mian looked at her old colleagues and felt a surge of emotions.</p><p>Xu Yan held onto Huo Mian’s hand, “I heard about South Side’s Huo Foundation during my morning meeting today. You’re now the chairman of the foundation and oversees its management. I also heard that they’re doubling your salary.”</p><p>“Yeah, they made the decision yesterday.” Huo Mian didn’t want to talk too much about the foundation since it was related to Huo Siqian.</p><p>“That’s amazing! Remember to treat us to dinner!”</p><p>“It’s a deal. I’ll treat all of you guys to dinner one day after work.”</p><p>Just as everyone was chatting happily, Wu Xiaoxue suddenly opened the door and came in…</p><p>She froze for a second upon seeing Huo Mian.

I think… it’s probably because I’m going to be a mother soon. I’m probably radiating a motherly aura.”</p><p>Then, Wu Xiaoxue smiled and sat down in the office chair across from Huo Mian…</p><p>“How have you been?” Wu Xiaoxue took the initiative and asked.</p><p>“Pretty good.”</p><p>“I envy you, you always seem as free as a bird,” Wu Xiaoxue exclaimed.</p><p>“You will too.”</p><p>“No… I won’t. Huo Mian, did you know? I finally came to the realization that my marriage with Ning Zhiyuan was a complete mistake. Our relationship isn’t what I thought it is. I used to foolishly think it was because you were interfering with us and that Ning Zhiyuan wasn’t over you, and that’s why I kept giving you a hard time. Now that I think back at everything, I feel like an idiot. It was never your problem to begin with.”</p><p>“Did something… happen between you guys?” Huo Mian figured that something must have happened between them for Wu Xiaoxue to say all that.</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue smiled bitterly, “Huo Mian, you were right about leaving him. Ning Zhiyuan isn’t what he claims to be. He is the ultimate hypocrite…”</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t say anything… She didn’t want to say bad things about an ex-boyfriend, because it was all in the past. However, upon hearing Wu Xiaoxue talk about Ning Zhiyuan like that, she was suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p>“Huo Mian, did you know that I used to hate how you always looked so calm and rational? I thought you were being pretentious. But now, I realized that it’s because I’m too stupid. You were able to leave him because you were rational. I fell too hard for him, and that’s why I’m stuck. Ning Zhiyuan doesn’t love me, he loves my family’s money and power, and my uncle’s position and reputation.”</p><p>“Maybe he really does like you,” Huo Mian consoled.</p><p>“Hahaha… that’s what I used to tell myself, but the truth is, he doesn’t. He only loves himself. The only thing he cares about is power, reputation, and whether he can be promoted. We began sleeping in separate rooms ever since I was discharged from the hospital, and I barely see him during the day. We don’t even have anything to talk about anymore.”</p><p>Shocked, Huo Mian replied, “That’s not good, it hasn’t even been that long since you guys got married.”</p></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":375,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:01.69","Link":"chapter-375-i-hate-how-rational-you-are-7-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 375 -  I Hate How Rational You Are (7)"},{"ID":18112095122404686,"Name":"Chapter 376 -  I Hate How Rational You Are (8)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 376 -  I Hate How Rational You Are (8)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 376: I Hate How Rational You Are (8)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“I don’t want to sleep in separate rooms either, but I can’t stand what he’s doing to me. Did you know that he still hangs out with He Man and is cheating on me with her? There’s also an intern nurse in the Ophthalmology Department that he’s been flirting with. Everyone knew about it except for me. How stupid am I?”</p><p>“Um… are you sure it’s true? Are there any misunderstandings?” Huo Mian tried not to think worse of others.</p><p>“I hired a detective; he doesn’t know that I know, and I don’t want to expose him yet. I’m pregnant right now so I can’t get divorced anyway. Once I have this baby, I’m going to sue for divorce and submit all my evidence to the judge. By then, Ning Zhiyuan will have no choice but to leave empty-handed. I hope he’ll just get lost,” Wu Xiaoxue spat, her eyes red with tears and fury.</p><p>Huo Mian could tell that she was angry and agitated…</p><p>“Calm down, I know that you’re sad and angry, but you have a baby growing in you. If the mother’s not in a good mood, it will affect the baby.”</p><p>“Huo Mian, since things have progressed to this stage, I have another question that I wanted to ask you, but you have to tell me the truth, okay?” Wu Xiaoxue grabbed a tissue to wipe off her tears and then looked up at Huo Mian.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“The ophthalmology papers that Ning Zhiyuan won awards for… you wrote them for him, didn’t you?”</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t say anything…</p><p>“Huo Mian, tell me the truth. I don’t want to be an idiot that was deceived by him again and again.”</p><p>“Yes, I wrote them.” Huo Mian finally admitted.</p><p>“Hahaha… I didn’t believe my uncle when he told me. I always thought that Ning Zhiyuan was a medical genius. Yes, he wasn’t a good person, but at least he was talented. But now everything seems to be a lie. He doesn’t have any hard skills but still pretends that he’s a genius of some sort. He disgusts me.”</p><p>“Back then, we had just graduated, and the job market wasn’t so good. He was a doctor, and the only way he could get a job was if he excelled in at least one aspect. So, I wrote him a paper. Later, I heard that the higher-ups liked his paper, so I wrote a couple more for him so that he could have some ground to stand on in the medical field. I never thought that things would come to this.”</p><p>To some extent, Huo Mian blamed herself. If she never helped Ning Zhiyuan, none of the rest would have happened.</p><p>“You really did everything you could for him, but not only does he not appreciate you, he even pushed all responsibilities onto you. When we began dating, he told me that you betrayed him and cheated on him with your ex-boyfriend. He also said that you were slutty and had a bad personality. Back then, I believed him.”</p><p>“He wasn’t wrong, I did get back together with my ex… but I’m not slutty,” Huo Mian said quietly.</p><p>“I can’t believe that I used to make your life hell. You never hated me for it and even saved me and my baby. I finally understand why my uncle thinks so highly of you. Huo Mian, I have never admired anyone in my life, but I admire you a lot. If it weren’t for everything that happened, I’d really like to be friends with you.”</p><p>“Don’t think too much, remember to get a lot of rest for you and your baby.”</p><p>When Huo Mian left, Wu Xiaoxue was still crying in her office…</p><p>Pregnancy gave people complicated emotions; plus, with all the dust that she’s eaten, Wu Xiaoxue was bound to feel hurt.</p><p>Huo Mian knew about Ning Zhiyuan and He Man, because she once bumped into them.</p><p>She stayed at the OB/GYN department for a little longer before leaving. As she headed out, she bumped into Ning Zhiyuan at the door.</p><p>He seemed to have just arrived at work because he had his own clothes on rather than scrubs.</p><p>“Mian…” Ning Zhiyuan’s expression filled with pleasant surprise when he saw her.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":376,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:02.24","Link":"chapter-376-i-hate-how-rational-you-are-8-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 376 -  I Hate How Rational You Are (8)"},{"ID":18112095127194861,"Name":"Chapter 377 - I Hate How Rational You Are (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 377 - I Hate How Rational You Are (9)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 377: I Hate How Rational You Are (9)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Hi.” Huo Mian’s sounded distant, as if she were greeting a stranger.</p><p>“Why are you here?

It’s just a title.”</p><p>“You’re really good at your job, I believe that you can become an outstanding doctor one day.” Ning Zhiyuan knew that back in university, Huo Mian’s dream was to become a doctor, not a nurse.</p><p>“Don’t kid me, I’m happy being a head nurse, I don’t want to become a doctor. Anyways, I have to go and run some errands now.”</p><p>“Wait, Mian.” Ning Zhiyuan was obviously not ready to let Huo Mian go just yet.</p><p>“Is there anything else, Doctor Ning?”</p><p>“My parents came to visit a few days ago. They brought me some farm-grown eggs and told me to give you half. I don’t have the chance to see you, so why don’t you give me an address? I’ll mail it to you later.”</p><p>“No, thanks. Eggs are fragile and will break easily if you mail them. Dr. Wu is pregnant, you should save those for her. Please thank Aunt and Uncle Ning for their kindness, will you?”</p><p>Huo Mian nodded at him with a smile on her face; then, she turned on her heels and left…</p><p>To her, Ning Zhiyuan was no more than a stranger. She felt nothing when she saw him.</p><p>Therefore, what Ning Zhiyuan said before was right – Huo Mian never loved him.</p><p>If she did, she would not be able to be so cool about it.</p><p>After she left the hospital, she didn’t have anything else to do, so she decided to head to Zhixin’s university.</p><p>However, Zhixin was hiking with some classmates and wasn’t at school.</p><p>On her way back, Zhu Lingling called…</p><p>While they chit-chatted, Huo Mian told her everything that happened at the First Hospital.</p><p>“Ning Zhiyuan probably envies you to death for living happily ever after since your breakup. You should stay away from him.”</p><p>“Would he? We broke up peacefully. Isn’t there an internet lingo that goes – ‘If my ex is doing well, then I should be happy’. Isn’t that the case?”</p><p>“Wrong, that phrase is so old, girl. Right now, it’s ‘if my ex is doing well, then I should ruin it’.”</p><p>Huo Mian was speechless. “Fine, you win.”</p><p>Huo Mian was shocked by how up-to-date Zhu Lingling was with her lingo.</p><p>“So, if Ning Zhiyuan finds out that you’re married to a rich, powerful, and handsome husband, he’s going to eat his heart out. He might even do stuff behind your back. You need to consider this possibility.”</p><p>“Wrong, it’s not that I didn’t consider this possibility, I just don’t want to think the worst of people.” Huo Mian explained with a smile.</p><p>“Oh right, did you unblock Gao Ran?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Haha, I applaud you for your stubbornness.”</p><p>“I’m too busy to deal with that stupid cop, just let him rest in peace in my blocked list,” Zhu Lingling said arrogantly.</p><ul><li>That night, at a club in the city –</li></ul><p>Ning Zhiyuan went straight to the bar after work instead of going home. Ever since Wu Xiaoxue and he separated, he’s gotten used to that life. Even if he went home, he’ll have to look at her icy expression.

Can you take me to South Side?”</p><p>“South Side? Why not go to the First Hospital, the medical equipment there is better.” Huo Mian asked in surprise.</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue shook her head. “I don’t want my coworkers to find out about what happened, please, Huo Mian.”</p><p>After seeing Wu Xiaoxue’s pleading expression, Huo Mian finally agreed. She helped her downstairs and drove her to South Side.</p><p>The equipment at South Side was advanced as well, but the medical team wasn’t as good as that of the First Hospital. After all, it was a place for recovery rather than surgery.</p><p>“It’s late, and none of the good doctors in the OB/GYN department are at work. If you don’t mind, I can examine you, is that alright?”</p><p>“Yes, please.” Wu Xiaoxue nodded; she never once doubted Huo Mian’s medical skills.</p><p>Huo Mian monitored Wu Xiaoxue’s condition on their way over, and she was a little worried.</p><p>She knew that Wu Xiaoxue was someone full of pride, so she didn’t have many friends. She would also never call others for help at a time like this, not even her parents.</p><p>But where was her husband, Ning Zhiyuan? Wasn’t he supposed to be by her side at a time like this?</p><p>“Dr. Wu, your husband…”</p><p>“He’s partying at the club with He Man,” Wu Xiaoxue hugged her belly and said in pain.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t respond…</p><p>“He Man just sent me a photo of them, it’s obvious she’s doing it on purpose. Haha, too bad I don’t care anymore. I won’t be the idiot that I used to be.” Then, Wu Xiaoxue searched through her phone and showed Huo Mian a photo.</p><p>Huo Mian glanced at it – it was indeed He Man and Ning Zhiyuan. They were dancing intimately.</p><p>“Dr. Wu, should I tell Director Wu?” concerned, Huo Mian asked.</p><p>“Don’t, if my uncle finds out, so will my parents. I don’t want them to worry about me anymore. Back then, they didn’t want me to marry Ning Zhiyuan, but I did anyway. I chose the road that I wanted to go down, so I’m going to see it through,” Wu Xiaoxue said as she gritted her teeth.</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue was a typical Leo – dominant, aggressive, and needed to be #1 in everything. Living like that must be tiring.</p><p>At this moment, Huo Mian no longer felt biased against Wu Xiaoxue. Instead, she was sympathetic…</p><p>Seeing Wu Xiaoxue so depressed, Huo Mian didn’t say anything else…</p><ul><li>South Side Recuperation Center –</li></ul><p>“Head Nurse, why are you here?” The on-call nurses were a little surprised to see Huo Mian.</p><p>“My friend needs to be examined. You guys can go back to work.” Then, Huo Mian helped Wu Xiaoxue up to the top floor, where the OB/GYN Department was.</p><p>Huo Mian started off by giving her an ultrasound…</p><p>Then, she drew her blood and sent it to the lab. She asked a colleague to rush the results.</p><p>Finally, she asked Wu Xiaoxue to lie in bed. She listened to the fetal heartbeat and did an EKG.</p><p>“How is it, Huo Mian?”</p><p>“I think you might’ve been too agitated and emotionally unstable. Your blood pressure and heart rate are slightly high, and your baby is in a bit of distress and her breathing frequency is off.

How on earth did this happen?</p><p>She had been wanting to screen for Down Syndrome, but she thought she was too young to be at risk; plus, work was really busy, so she put this task on the side burner.</p><p>If Huo Mian hadn’t done it for her today, she would’ve been ignorant until the birth of her baby…</p><p>“Oh my god, what am I supposed to do now?” Wu Xiaoxue was in shock. She began to cry uncontrollably.</p><p>Although she and Ning Zhiyuan were in a cold war, she still loved their baby.</p><p>Their baby was innocent; she spent so much time and effort in keeping her safe, and now this happened?</p><p>“Don’t worry, let’s deal with the problems one at a time. We may be able to cure your miscarriage symptoms, let me inject you with some medicine to keep your baby safe. You need to calm down, controlling your emotions is critical, don’t get depressed or overly nervous,” Huo Mian consoled her.</p><p>“Does it matter if I keep her or not? If she’s deformed, we might as well induce labor now…”</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue’s voice was so coarse that she could barely even finish her sentence…</p><p>No woman in this world would be able to handle a situation like this, let alone Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“Your fetus is already 5 months old, and her hands and feet have already developed. If we induce labor right now, not only will you lose your baby, it is also extremely harmful to your body. You’re a doctor, I shouldn’t have to remind you of these things because you should already know.”</p><p>“Huo Mian, what should I do now? I really want to give birth to her, I love her.” Wu Xiaoxue grabbed Huo Mian’s hand as she sobbed, tearing streaming down her face.</p><p>When her baby was 4 months old, she did an ultrasound, which revealed that her baby was a girl. Not only was she not disappointed that she was having a girl, she even happily bought her unborn child a bunch of infant dresses.</p><p>Now that she was faced with dangers of miscarriage and her baby was at high risk for Down Syndrome, Wu Xiaoxue felt like her entire world was crashing down around her.</p><p>“Dr. Wu, calm down, can you let me finish?” Huo Mian sat down beside Wu Xiaoxue and gently patted her back.</p><p>Wu Xiaoxue covered her mouth and cried silently…</p><p>“Just because your baby seems to be at high risk, it doesn’t mean that she’s going to be deformed. We can’t be pessimistic, currently, Jing Capital’s Third Hospital is the only domestic hospital advanced enough to give you an amniocentesis, so I suggest that you take a few days off and go there to get a comprehensive checkup. If the baby is healthy, then keep her. If she isn’t then… that’s fine, it just means that you two weren’t meant to meet. You’re still young, you’ll get pregnant again.” Huo Mian tried to be gentle in her words.</p><p>(TL Note: At the last chapter of every day, I will write something for sure.

I can’t overthink this without knowing all the facts.”</p><p>Just now, she was so nervous that she lost her ability to think. Upon hearing what Huo Mian said, Wu Xiaoxue somewhat calmed down.</p><p>“For now, you will receive one injection a day to keep her safe. Watch what you eat, and… take a few days off from work and make sure that nothing happens to the fetus. Then, once you regain energy, go straight to Jing City, okay?”</p><p>“Okay.” Wu Xiaoxue agreed with Huo Mian’s suggestions, so she nodded.</p><p>It was already half past midnight when they finished the series of examinations, Huo Mian drove Wu Xiaoxue home before heading home herself.</p><p>It was already close to 1 AM when she arrived home. She dragged her exhausted body into the bathroom and took a hot shower.</p><p>When she came out from the bathroom, she saw that Wu Xiaoxue had sent a text to her.</p><p>“Thank you, Huo Mian, I’m glad you were here with me tonight.”</p><p>Huo Mian smiled but didn’t reply; it was late, and she didn’t want to disturb Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>To save face, Wu Xiaoxue didn’t want her colleagues to know and refused to go to the First Hospital. The truth was, Huo Mian understood why she did that. After all, Wu Xiaoxue was an incredibly proud individual…</p><p>At 1:30 AM, just as Huo Mian got ready for bed, she heard the sound of keys turning.</p><p>She immediately jumped up and hid behind the bedroom door, ready to scare Qin Chu.</p><p>After a while, Qin Chu came straight upstairs and went into their bedroom.</p><p>“HI!” Huo Mian suddenly jumped out and hugged Qin Chu from behind.</p><p>However, Mr. Qin did not react at all…</p><p>He turned around and hugged Huo Mian. Then, he picked her up and spun her around…</p><p>“Why weren’t you scared?” Huo Mian puckered her lips and asked.</p><p>“I knew you were at home. I saw the shoes you wore this morning downstairs and noticed that the lights in the bedroom were still on.”</p><p>“Okay fine, Mr. Chulock Holmes, you’re the best at detective work, okay? This is no fun at all.”</p><p>Qin Chu was so smart that she couldn’t even surprise him…</p><p>“Why aren’t you asleep yet?” Qin Chu was surprised that Huo Mian wasn’t already in dreamland.</p><p>“I just came back from the hospital.”</p><p>“Don’t you have the day off today? Why were you at the hospital?” Qin Chu was more aware of Huo Mian’s work schedule than Huo Mian herself.</p><p>Then, Huo Mian told Qin Chu everything that happened with Wu Xiaoxue.</p><p>“So… you’re telling me that you took Ning Zhiyuan’s wife to the hospital?”</p><p>“Ahem… I didn’t help her just because she’s Ning Zhiyuan’s wife, I …”</p><p>Nervous, Huo Mian tried to explain, but Qin Chu smiled and patted her on the head, “I know, I’m just kidding.”</p><p>“Did you just come back from out of town?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Go take a shower and let’s go to bed. You must be exhausted.”</p><p>Truth be told, Huo Mian hated seeing Qin Chu waking up so early and sleeping so late like this.</p><p>“It’s okay, I still have one more video conference left. You should sleep first.”</p><p>Then, he lightly kissed Huo Mian on the forehead and walked into the study. He turned on his laptop.</p><p>Huo Mian caringly made him a cup of hot coffee and gently closed the door behind her as she left…</p><ul><li>The next morning –</li></ul><p>By the time Huo Mian woke up, Qin Chu had already made breakfast.</p><p>After washing up, she sat before the dining table. Before she could say anything, Qin Chu said, “Don’t go to work today, I requested a three-day vacation for you.”</p><p>“Um… why?” Huo Mian was surprised.</p><p>“Because starting today, we are going on a mini makeup honeymoon.”</p><p>“Honeymoon?” Huo Mian was completely dumbfounded.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":380,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:04.233","Link":"chapter-380-a-mini-honey-moon-2-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 380 - A Mini Honey Moon (2)"},{"ID":18112095147236955,"Name":"Chapter 381 - A Mini Honeymoon (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 381 - A Mini Honeymoon (3)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 381: A Mini Honeymoon (3)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>“It’s a secret,” Qin Chu said with a straight face.</p><p>Huo Mian was speechless…</p><p>“Fine, I guess we can’t really go anywhere in three days.” Huo Mian really wanted to go to the Maldives, but the trip there was too long and they would’ve spent a whole three days just to get there and back. Adding that onto the actual vacation, they would be gone for at least ten days.</p><p>To Qin Chu and herself, a ten-day vacation was too luxurious and unrealistic.</p><p>Qin Chu was being mysterious and wouldn’t say anything, so Huo Mian didn’t ask.</p><p>After breakfast, she was just about to head upstairs.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m going to pack; I need sunscreen, clothes, and some other stuff. Oh right, do I need to bring a tent? Are we going to the beach or into the mountains?”</p><p>Qin Chu’s face was filled with helplessness…</p><p>“Come back here, you don’t need to bring anything but me.”</p><p>Huo Mian nodded her head, “Mhm, I’ll bring you, and you’ll bring money.”</p><p>Qin Chu was silent…</p><p>Qin Chu wondered when his wife became so talkative; perhaps she learned it from that shrew, Zhu Lingling.</p><p>Sometimes her words were weirdly funny, wasn’t that right?</p><p>After the two had breakfast, Qin Chu and Huo Mian left their condo, hand in hand.</p><p>Although they didn’t bring anything, the two both changed into dark grey casual wear.</p><p>The clothes were from a famous luxury outerwear brand. It was a stylish unisex outfit.</p><p>It really looked like everything had been planned out, as Qin Chu changed his car, parking his Maybach into the garage.</p><p>Instead, he drove a black Range Rover…</p><p>Huo Mian was still in the dark by the time they got onto the highway…</p><p>“Where are we actually going? You’re not selling me, are you?”</p><p>“No, if I sold you, I won’t have a wife anymore,” Qin Chu said with a serious face.</p><p>Huo Mian was in a great mood, so she took out her phone and uploaded a video to her friend circle.</p><p>In the caption, she wrote: “A spur of the moment trip”.</p><p>It really was a spur of the moment trip, as it was without any plan or hints.</p><p>She was pulled away by Qin Chu so suddenly, who had asked for a three-day vacation in her stead.</p><p>Immediately, Zhu Lingling commented, “You went out without me? I’m leaving a bad review.”</p><p>“I’m going with Mr. Qin, you sure you wanna come?”</p><p>“That’s fine then, I don’t want to be a third wheel.”</p><p>“Haha, that’s why I didn’t invite you.”</p><p>“Where are you going and when are you coming back?”</p><p>“I don’t know where I’m going, Mr. Qin won’t say. He’s pretending to be mysterious. I’ll be gone for three days.”</p><p>“Three days? Fine, you’re spoiled beyond belief. Have a good time,” Zhu Lingling enviously replied.</p><p>“Oh, where are you enjoying life now?” Gao Ran commented.</p><p>“I dunno where we’re going, Mr. Qin won’t say. I’m just tagging along.”</p><p>“You’re killing us single people, you’re living your best days. Tsk, tsk…”</p><p>“Do you want to come?”</p><p>“That’s alright, I don’t want to the third wheel.” Gao Ran had the same explanation as Zhu Lingling.</p><p>“If you come with Lingling, you won’t be a third wheel,” Huo Mian teased him.</p><p>“Zhu Lingling is going?” Clearly, Gao Ran seemed interested.</p><p>“Why don’t you ask her yourself…”</p><p>“Bro, I am still on her blacklist.” Gao Ran was helpless.</p><p>“Then go to her apartment and wait for her to come out, she can run but her house can’t,” Huo Mian suggested.</p><p>“Eh, you don’t say. This method may actually be viable. No wonder Qin Chu calls you smart, you’re much better than us,” Gao Ran lamented.</p><p>Unable to hold back, Huo Mian giggled…</p><p>“What’s making you laugh so hard?” On the driver seat, Qin Chu couldn’t resist anymore and asked.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":381,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:04.723","Link":"chapter-381-a-mini-honeymoon-3-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 381 - A Mini Honeymoon (3)"},{"ID":18112095151719954,"Name":"Chapter 382 - A Little Honey Moon (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 382 - A Little Honey Moon (4)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 382: A Little Honey Moon (4)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“I was just teasing our comrades, Zhu Lingling and Gao Ran.”</p><p>“Are they still fussing over each other?” Qin Chu normally had no interest in other people’s business, but he was speechless over how Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling treated each other.</p><p>“You think they’re fussing too?” Huo Mian chuckled.</p><p>“If not, then what?”</p><p>“Fine, we’re thinking of the same thing. But I think that they’ll resolve whatever it is that’s going on between them soon. Ms. Zhu Lingling won’t be able to keep up the act.”</p><p>The corners of Qin Chu’s mouth rose to a smile, but he remained silent…</p><p>Wherever they were going was quite far; they were on the highway for as long as five hours.</p><p>During the trip, Huo Mian kept asking if he wanted her to drive for a while, but Qin Chu refused each and every time.</p><p>Honestly, he wasn’t a little bit sleepy in the company of his wife…</p><p>He even felt like the scenery was more beautiful than usual.</p><p>Five hours later, Qin Chu exited the highway in a roundabout and drove into the depths of a mountain range.</p><p>When they arrived, Huo Mian realized they were at the famous Sacred Northern Mountain, Yunding Mountain.</p><p>Yunding Mountain was located at the northern edge of the country, where it intersected with Country E and Country C.</p><p>So, one could see three countries at once…</p><p>Huo Mian had wanted to visit Yunding Mountain long ago because she heard that the scenery was beautiful. However, she gave up due to the difficulty and riskiness of the trail.</p><p>She was surprised that Qin Chu would actually bring her here…</p><p>Looking at the steep mountain range, Huo Mian was deeply shocked.</p><p>If you didn’t see it with your own eyes, you wouldn’t experience how magical and majestic nature could be.</p><p>“Yunding Mountain is so beautiful… the unending mountain range is marvelous,” Huo Mian exclaimed.</p><p>The two of them got off the car after Qin Chu parked it in the parking lot of a super luxurious five-star hotel.</p><p>Huo Mian looked up to see the name of the hotel – Golden Palm International Resort.</p><p>With one look, she could tell that the name was high class. The architecture was majestic and royal, and the Chinese-Russian style of decor was incredibly eye-catching.</p><p>Qin Chu pulled Huo Mian in by her hand, and the bellman carefully opened the door for them.</p><ul><li>At the reception desk –</li></ul><p>“Welcome! Here to check in?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Sir, what type of room do you want, and do you have a reservation?”</p><p>“The presidential suite. No reservation,” Qin Chu pridefully replied.</p><p>“Certainly, sir. There is a vacant presidential suite. How long will you be staying?”</p><p>“Two nights.”</p><p>“Good, can you please show me your IDs?” the receptionist politely asked.</p><p>Qin Chu slowly opened his wallet and passed her his ID…</p><p>When the receptionist took one look at it, she was immediately a little dumbfounded.</p><p>“President… President Qin.”</p><p>What this receptionist said alerted the other three. The three of them looked at the ID and then at Qin Chu, who was there in the flesh.</p><p>At last, they bowed down at the same time, “Hello, President Qin.”</p><p>“Uh… What’s going on?” This time, it was Huo Mian who was dumbfounded.</p><p>“I’m just here on vacation, you don’t have to be too nervous.”</p><p>“Yes, President Qin, your room is ready for you. You can take the elevator directly to the top floor.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Holding the room card and Huo Mian’s hand, Qin Chu walked away.</p><p>“Eh… honey, we didn’t pay yet.”</p><p>“Why do I have to pay if I own the business?” finding Huo Mian’s remarks funny, Qin Chu asked her back.</p><p>“You own the business?” Huo Mian had not recovered yet from the initial shock.</p><p>“Two months ago, GK spent 3.9 billion yuan and bought the Golden Palm Resort and the rights to this part of Yunding Mountain. So, from now on… this resort is a daughter company of GK.”</p><p>“Wow… you’re so spoiled.” Although Huo Mian knew how rich GK was, she was still taken by surprise.</p><p>It was 3.9 billion, not just a casual grocery run at a market…</p><p>Taking their room card, the two took the elevator up to the eighteenth floor and reached the presidential suite, room 1888.</p><p>It was more than three hundred square meters in size and had an amazing view. The windows were made of tempered glass and completely see through.</p><p>There were no other buildings in the vicinity, which gave them great privacy.</p><p>Opening a window, Huo Mian closed her eyes and breathed in the fresh air, exclaiming, “The air here is wonderful.”</p><p>Qin Chu took off his jacket, walked up to her and carefully embraced Huo Mian’s waist from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder.</p><p>“Do you like it here?” His tone couldn’t be more gentle.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":382,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:05.173","Link":"chapter-382-a-little-honey-moon-4-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 382 - A Little Honey Moon (4)"},{"ID":18112095156533717,"Name":"Chapter 383 -  A Little Honey Moon (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 383 -  A Little Honey Moon (5)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 383: A Little Honey Moon (5)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“I like it, I like it a lot.” Huo Mian opened her eyes, leaned into Qin Chu’s arms and looked at the mountain range in the distance.</p><p>“This vacation is a little short, it’s just a little getaway. When you have time for a longer vacation, I’ll take you to the Maldives.”</p><p>“Mhm.” Filled with happiness, Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>At that moment, their in-suite phone rang…</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“Okay, I got it.”</p><p>“Let’s go eat.”</p><p>The two descended to the fifteenth floor where a high-class western restaurant was located.</p><p>When Huo Mian entered, to her surprise, she realized that they were the only two people inside this huge rotating restaurant.</p><p>“Why are there so little guests? It’s just the two of us?” Huo Mian was confused.</p><p>“The hotel manager probably asked the others to clear out,” Qin Chu guessed.</p><p>Of course, as the two took their seats, a chubby man in his forties walked up to them.</p><p>Clad in a high-end suit, he walked up to Qin Chu and lightly bowed, “President Qin, why didn’t you call ahead? I could’ve personally welcomed you.”</p><p>“It was a spontaneous decision on my part.”</p><p>“And this is your friend?” the hotel manager tactfully asked.</p><p>“No, she’s my wife,” Qin Chu replied.</p><p>The hotel manager was a little shocked at first but bowed immediately, “Hello, Young Mistress.”</p><p>“Hi.” Huo Mian nodded back.</p><p>“President Qin, Young Mistress, lunch is ready for you. If you need anything, just let the kitchen know.”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“Then, I’ll go now. I hope you two have a great time here.”</p><p>When the hotel manager heard that the Corporation’s president was here, he dared not hesitate and immediately greeted them.</p><p>He even arranged a lavish lunch for the couple…</p><p>Looking at the red wine, steak, fruit salad, foie gras, caviar, and desserts filling the table made Huo Mian’s mood even better.</p><p>“It all looks delicious.” Huo Mian licked her lips.</p><p>Qin Chu smiled at her in a spoiled way and placed a roasted Argentinian shrimp in Huo Mian’s plate.</p><p>At that moment, Huo Mian suddenly remembered something and said, “Honey, I have something to tell you.”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“Huo Siqian went to South Side a few days ago, established the Huo Foundation, and made me the chairwoman.”</p><p>Huo Mian simply went over what Huo Siqian did, because she didn’t want to keep it from Qin Chu.</p><p>Upon hearing what she said, Qin Chu nodded and said, “If he wants to be a philanthropist, then let him be.”</p><p>“I thought so too, but… I feel like he has ulterior motives. Do you think… do you think that he is conspiring something?”</p><p>“I’m not sure, but we’ll see.” Qin Chu was quite cautious towards Huo Siqian.</p><p>“Mhm, you’re not angry?”</p><p>“Why would I be angry?”</p><p>“Huo Siqian always does stuff like this at South Side…” Huo Mian slowly said.</p><p>“As long as he doesn’t do anything that hinders you, let him. He’s fine as long as he doesn’t touch my bottom line.”</p><p>Qin Chu had no time to deal with Huo Siqian, because in his mind, Su Yu was relatively harder to deal with.</p><p>He didn’t want to tell Huo Mian that, or else she might overthink things and exhaust herself.</p><p>After the two ate a delicious lunch, Qin Chu went to the conference room for a video conference.</p><p>Huo Mian was bored and changed into a white outfit given to her by the PR department before going downstairs to stroll around.</p><p>“Young Mistress.”</p><p>“Hello, Young Mistress.”</p><p>On the way, no matter who saw her, they would all call her ‘Young Mistress”, making her quite uncomfortable.</p><p>She logged onto Weibo, which she had not used for a long time, and posted a few scenery photos.</p><p>She wrote, “I want a house, not a gorgeous one but one where I can happily grow old in.”</p><p>A few seconds later, Su Yu sent her a private message saying, “What kind of house do you want, I’ll buy you one.”</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":383,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:05.653","Link":"chapter-383-a-little-honey-moon-5-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 383 -  A Little Honey Moon (5)"},{"ID":18112095161555843,"Name":"Chapter 384 - A Little Honey Moon (6)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 384 - A Little Honey Moon (6)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 384: A Little Honey Moon (6)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“I don’t need one, thanks.”</p><p>“I am not joking, I am being serious,” Su Yu insisted.</p><p>“I’m not joking, I am being serious too.

To prevent fans from finding out, he couldn’t even comment.</p><p>He could only send her private messages, which pissed him off…</p><p>The main thing was that Huo Mian rarely used Weibo, only logging on when she remembered to. So, she spent very little time online.</p><p>Poor Su Yu had Weibo open twenty-four hours a day and only closely followed Huo Mian’s notifications. As soon as she updated her Weibo, he would immediately talk to her.</p><p>Simply, his method was quite childish…</p><p>After Qin Chu finished his meeting, he came straight downstairs to look for Huo Mian. The two held hands and walked around in the garden in front of the hotel.</p><p>Listening to the bird chirps all around, their moods were especially pleasant…</p><p>“Did you notice that the sky is bluer here than it is where we live?” raising her head to look at the sky, Huo Mian said.</p><p>She felt like the clouds were like white cotton candy floating in the crystal blue sky.</p><p>“The ecology is untouched here, there’s no exhaust, no heavy construction, and no factories. In turn, there’s no smog.”</p><p>“That’s great, this is the kind of place that’s actually fit for living. The concrete and steel feel like a cage. Honey, can we live out our retirement here?”</p><p>“Okay, we’ll go wherever you want to go.” Qin Chu dotingly looked at her.</p><p>“You seem busy lately.”</p><p>“Mhm, a little. The company is hosting a thirtieth-anniversary celebration soon.”</p><p>“Why did you take me out then?” Huo Mian was shocked.</p><p>“I’m taking a break while busy, right? Also, in a few days, I might not be able to take care of you while busy. So, I wanted to bring you here now to take your mind off of things. In an environment like South Side, you only get to interact with patients. Depression is inevitable if you work there for too long.”</p><p>“That’s true, all day, they complain about how much pain they’re in. I hear them complain so often that I feel like I can literally feel their pain.”</p><p>Huo Mian covered her mouth and smiled…</p><p>Before dinner at dusk, Huo Mian and Qin Chu went to a hot spring closeby under the arrangements of the hotel.</p><p>It was a natural spring; Huo Mian really liked it because it was formed completely naturally and hadn’t been tampered by humans.</p><p>Above the hot spring was the Yunding Mountain range.

It never melted.</p><p>So, many tourists from the south would shriek in surprise when they visited, as they had never seen snow in their lives.</p><p>It was too beautiful, almost like a fantasy kingdom made of snow…</p><p>“Mr. Qin, thank you for taking me to such a great place, treating me to delicious food, and letting me see such breathtaking views.” In the hot spring, Huo Mian raised up a small wine glass and smiled.</p><p>“Goddess Huo, thank you for coming back to me and being with me night and day, walking with my hand in yours through thick and thin. Thank you for leaving the lights on for me when I get home late.” Qin Chu raised his cup as well.</p><p>“Do you think it’s good for us to be so sentimental?” Huo Mian softly laughed.</p><p>Qin Chu didn’t reply, but he scooted closer with his wine glass and kissed Huo Mian’s rosy lips from the side, catching her off guard.</p><p>( Comment if you can’t see TL Thought)</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":384,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:06.157","Link":"chapter-384-a-little-honey-moon-6-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 384 - A Little Honey Moon (6)"},{"ID":18112095167048286,"Name":"Chapter 385 - A Mini Honey Moon (7)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 385 - A Mini Honey Moon (7)","Description":"<p></p><h3 id=\"chapter385aminihoneymoon7\">Chapter 385: A Mini Honey Moon (7)</h3><h6 id=\"translatornoodletowntranslatededitornoodletowntranslated\">Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</h6><p></p><p>Inside the forty-five degrees celsius natural spring…</p><p>There were only the two of them silently embracing each other and kissing…</p><p>Occasionally, blankets of snowflakes fluttered down from the mountain…</p><p>Huo Mian knew she would never forget such a tender moment as long as she lived…</p><p>She believed that even years later, she would still tear up upon thinking about this occasion.</p><p>Qin Chu had put in so much thought and effort to make a sentence she said as a young girl come true.</p><p>It was seven years ago…</p><p>The two went to a ski resort together, and Huo Mian had said, “It would be great if we have our own resort in the future with snow as it’s theme. It’ll have hot springs, a skating rink, and when we’re in the hot spring, it would be snowing. Wow, I’m dying from just thinking about how fun that would be. It’s so romantic just thinking about it.”</p><p>“That day will come.” Back then, Qin Chu only casually said those words.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t take it to her heart. Seven years had passed, and she had forgotten that they once had this conversation.</p><p>As for Qin Chu, he went to painstaking lengths to fulfill something that she couldn’t even remember…</p><p>After a long time, Qin Chu unwillingly let go of Huo Mian…</p><p>Then, the two clinked their glasses together and sipped red wine…</p><p>At dinner time, the manager of the hot springs carefully walked out and reminded them, “President Qin, Young Mistress, dinner is ready for you. Please move to the fifteenth floor.”</p><p>Qin Chu nodded and pulled Huo Mian out of the hot springs by her hand, draping a white towel around her.</p><p>After they changed into evening wear, the two returned to the hotel.</p><p>Qin Chu’s employees were very reliable. As soon as they heard that the President and the Young Mistress were dining, they began preparing.</p><p>The outfits that they wore all fit the style of a dinner banquet. Qin Chu was wearing an all-black suit; the slim fit made him stylish.</p><p>Huo Mian was wearing a white strapless evening gown with an elegant blooming peony by her collar bones, perfectly covering her chest. (TL Note: Peony sounds like p on me, hehe)</p><p>Paired with a pair of white heels, her temperament was through the roof…</p><p>After changing in her suite, Huo Mian slowly walked out. She rarely wore heels and was afraid of falling.</p><p>As soon as Qin Chu saw Huo Mian, his eyes showed his amazement…</p><p>He always knew that when his Mian dressed up, her aura became extremely strong.</p><p>“We’re just eating, do I have to dress up so formally?” Huo Mian was a little embarrassed.</p><p>She wasn’t used to this type of dress up and felt the inability to be herself.</p><p>“Let’s go, we have guests to see in a bit.”</p><p>“Guests?” Huo Mian was confused. They were dressed so formally, who could it be?</p><p>Huo Mian felt slightly unsettled after remembering something…</p><p>“Qin Chu… Listen to me, I’m not ready yet…:”</p><p>“I know what you’re worrying about, rest assured, I’m not taking you to meet my parents.” Qin Chu carefully patted Huo Mian’s hands and comforted her.</p><p>Seeing Qin Chu settling her nerves with one sentence, Huo Mian lowered her head and did not say anything…</p><p>She didn’t care who it was as long as it wasn’t Qin Chu’s parents, because she knew that she wouldn’t be able to sit through an enjoyable dinner with her in-laws.</p><p>When Qin Chu and Huo Mian walked by, many female employees whispered.</p><p>“President Qin is so handsome… God, he’s much hotter in person than in pictures. He looks like a superstar.”</p><p>“Yeah, he looks young too, he’s probably not even thirty.”</p><p>“Young Mistress looks alright, she’s not that stunning. I don’t know how she managed to capture the president’s heart.”</p><p>“That’s right, the president’s so perfect and a little wasted marrying Young Mistress.”</p><p>Although their voices were low, Huo Mian occasionally heard the complaints…</p><p>She couldn’t resist a quick chuckle as she tightened her grasp around Qin Chu’s arm.</p><p>– Inside the Chinese restaurant on the fifteenth floor –</p><p>When Qin Chu and Huo Mian walked in, there were already people waiting there.</p><p>Huo Mian’s eyes filled with surprise when she saw who they were.</p><p>(TL Note: A little early release~)</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":385,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:06.707","Link":"chapter-385-a-mini-honey-moon-7-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 385 - A Mini Honey Moon (7)"},{"ID":18112095171762048,"Name":"Chapter 386 - A Mini Honey Moon (8)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 386 - A Mini Honey Moon (8)","Description":"<p></p><h3 id=\"chapter386aminihoneymoon8\">Chapter 386: A Mini Honey Moon (8)</h3><h6 id=\"translatornoodletowntranslatededitornoodletowntranslated-1\">Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</h6><p></p><p>“You two… How dare you surprise me with Qin Chu, do you still want to live? Huh? Take them out and behead them,” Huo Mian joked.</p><p>Zhu Lingling and Gao Ran both stood up…</p><p>Zhu Lingling was in a sexy maroon evening gown, with one of her shoulders exposed.</p><p>Gao Ran was in a navy blue suit, elegant yet luxurious. This formal getup was super out of the ordinary.</p><p>“Spare me, Queen Huo. It’s your husband who told me not to tell you because he wanted to give you a surprise.”</p><p>“I am surprised, so… did you guys make up?”</p><p>Gao Ran was silent…</p><p>Zhu Lingling said, “Uh…”</p><p>Huo Mian pointed at Zhu Lingling again, “You’re not mad at him anymore? Have you dragged him out of your blacklist?”</p><p>“Seeing how generous Mr. Qin is, treating us to free food and a presidential suite, I’ll drag him out.”</p><p>“Tsk, tsk… Your integrity is all over the floor…” Huo Mian softly chuckled.</p><p>“Why do I need integrity? I can’t eat integrity, but I can eat free food and enjoy myself without spending money.”</p><p>“That’s right, I’m not letting the free food go to waste.” Gao Ran backed her up.</p><p>“It’s like you came to try and eat each other…” Qin Chu lamented.</p><p>“Eh, how could us? President Qin, come and sit.” Gao Ran pulled out a chair and called at Qin Chu.</p><p>The four sat opposite from each other…</p><p>Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu, “If I knew that they were coming, I wouldn’t have dressed so formally.”</p><p>“Don’t be in such a hurry, you’ll see soon enough.” Qin Chu gave her a mysterious smile.</p><p>“What’s going on? Is Gao Ran going to ask Lingling out?” carelessly, Huo Mian asked.</p><p>“Ahem…” taken by surprise, Gao Ran coughed.</p><p>Zhu Lingling’s face, on the other hand, was covered with awkwardness…</p><p>“Is this event planned?” jokingly, Qin Chu asked Gao Ran.</p><p>Gao Ran waved his hands, “No, definitely not.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s eat first.”</p><p>Qin Chu waved his hands, and the servers began bringing food to their table…</p><p>In the middle of the table was a huge steel pan. It was still hot with a fire burning beneath it.</p><p>“Stove-roasted fish?” looking at the fish, Huo Mian curiously asked.</p><p>“It doesn’t look like it…” Zhu Lingling shook her head.</p><p>“This is a special recipe, the fish was caught in Yunding River and is very fresh. This species of fish is quite rare and can only be found in this area. It is very savory and has already been simmered for three hours with some local seasoning. It’s a dish that locals always prepare during the new year,” unlike his usual silent self, Qin Chu explained.</p><p>“It looks appetizing.” With his chopsticks in hand, Gao Ran couldn’t wait to try it.</p><p>Then, the servers brought up some local vegetables and fruits one by one.</p><p>Although there were only four people, the table was filled with food…</p><p>It was a feast of land and sea delicacies…</p><p>When Qin Chu called Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling and invited them here, they agreed without thinking. However, Qin Chu said that he had one request.</p><p>The request was that the two must come together and that Gao Ran must drive Zhu Lingling here in his car.</p><p>Otherwise, neither of them could come. So, losing all dignity in the face of food, drinks, and fun, the two miraculously made up.</p><p>During dinner, Qin Chu was busy putting food in Huo Mian plate. “Try this, it’s local wild vegetables.”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“Oh my god, can you two stop bullying us single people? Turn down your PDA, it’s annoying.” Gao Ran was green with jealousy.</p><p>“Showing PDA is a sin.” Zhu Lingling joined in.</p><p>Huo Mian raised her head and slowly said, “People who eat free food shouldn’t cause a scene. Just eat your food in peace.”</p><p>“No wonder she’s the Young Mistress, even her tone is so arrogant.”</p><p>Zhu Lingling and Gao Ran jested…</p><p>Everytime the four ate together, they would turn the earth with their fighting.</p><p>Even Qin Chu was more talkative than usual…</p><p>Everyone seemed to be in a good mood…</p><p>An hour later, Qin Chu looked at his watch and said, “It’s almost time. Let’s go, guys.”</p><p>“Where are we going? Is there something planned?” Gao Ran rose up with a smile on his face and asked.</p><p>“You’ll know when you get there.” Qin Chu didn’t want to say anything else.</p><p>Huo Mian had a feeling that Qin Chu was acting weird, not willing to reveal anything as if he had some secret to hide.</p><p>Noodletown_ Noodletown_ As I agreed to a fellow reader, two chaps came early tonight, the rest are coming at usual time~</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":386,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:07.177","Link":"chapter-386-a-mini-honey-moon-8-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 386 - A Mini Honey Moon (8)"},{"ID":18112095177531667,"Name":"Chapter 387 - A Mini Honey Moon (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 387 - A Mini Honey Moon (9)","Description":"<p></p><h3 id=\"chapter387aminihoneymoon9\">Chapter 387: A Mini Honey Moon (9)</h3><h6 id=\"translatornoodletowntranslatededitornoodletowntranslated-2\">Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</h6><p></p><p>Qin Chu led the three of them down to the second floor in the elevator, and they arrived inside the Noble Orchid Banquet Hall.</p><p>The second the door was pushed open, Huo Mian felt her eyes pierced by bright lights.</p><p>It was so bright that she could barely open her eyes…</p><p>“President Qin…” Many came over to say hi.</p><p>In the three or four hundred square meters was a western-style banquet, and it was packed with plenty of people.</p><p>“President Qin, you’re here! We’re ready,” the manager of the hotel carefully said as he walked over.</p><p>Qin Chu nodded and tilted his head to say to Huo Mian, “Wait for me.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Then the hotel manager led Qin Chu onto the stage…</p><p>“Let us welcome the president of our corporation, Mr. Qin, to say a few words.”</p><p>Then, clapping sounds shook the space…</p><p>“Don’t you see a halo above your man’s head right now?” asked Zhu Lingling as she smiled.</p><p>“What? You think he’s Cupid? With his own halo?” Huo Mian couldn’t hold in her laughter.</p><p>Just then, Huo Mian, Gao Ran, and Zhu Lingling stood beneath the stage and looked at Qin Chu speak with a halo.</p><p>He paid a few procedural thanks, and finally, he said, “Ever since I took on this vacation village, I did a lot of research, and realized that the financial situation of these mountainous regions is quite dire due to the lack of transportation. Many children don’t even have the money to finish elementary school, and I’m truly shocked by this. My wife works in the medical field and has a genuinely kind heart. I believe she shares my values and is willing to help those that need it. So today, I would like to announce the establishment of the Mian Angel Children’s Foundation, named after my wife. It will help the children living in Yunding Mountain who didn’t have the chance to attend school to re-establish their academics. Thank you, everyone.”</p><p>After Qin Chu spoke, claps shook the space…</p><p>Meanwhile, Huo Mian’s eyes were filled with tears…</p><p>She was truly shocked by Qin Chu’s secret….</p><p>“Mian Foundation? Whoa, your husband really loves you.” Even Zhu Lingling felt moved.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t make a sound as she bit into her lips…</p><p>When Qin Chu walked down from the stage…</p><p>Their eyes made contact, and this exchange of glances was worth more than tens of thousands of words…</p><p>“My beautiful wife, may I please have this dance?”</p><p>Qin Chu held out his hand like a gentleman as an invitation…</p><p>Huo Mian handed her pearly white hand to him, with tears in her eyes, and the two walked over to the dance floor…</p><p>Along with the music, they danced to the banquet’s first waltz…</p><p>Speaking of the waltz, Huo Mian wasn’t familiar with it since she didn’t have any money to take classes, but she did learn a little bit back when they were in school.</p><p>The two of them would go skating together, and while they skated, Qin Chu would teach her the waltz on ice.</p><p>Seven years later, Huo Mian still danced so well, surprising even Zhu Lingling.</p><p>“My gosh, when did this lady learn how to waltz? Even her dance steps are so up to standard.”</p><p>Gao Ran raised his thumb, looked at Qin Chu, and praised, “That Qin Chu always look like a quiet and reserved guy, but who knew he would be so good at picking up girls?”</p><p>The banquet was quite lively, as some local government officials and executives came as well, and many local entrepreneurs also received invitations.</p><p>Amongst this liveliness, Huo Mian never realized that she would be in such a high-profile setting.</p><p>Luckily, this was Yunding Mountain and not C City, so it wouldn’t end up on the papers, or be spread around. Most importantly, her mother wouldn’t know.</p><p>After they hung around the banquet, the four escaped from the scene together…</p><p>They ran outside the hotel to the field of grass for a breath of fresh air.</p><p>The stars in the sky were always so bright, and it was especially nice to look at the stars from this latitude.</p><p>Suddenly, a shooting star passed by…</p><p>“Look, a shooting star!” After she spoke, Zhu Lingling immediately closed her eyes to make a wish.</p><p>Then, Huo Mian and Gao Ran both closed their eyes and made their wishes.</p><p>“Qin Chu, why aren’t you making a wish?” Gao Ran opened his eyes after quite a while and saw that Qin Chu was just standing around, looking dumb.</p><p>“My wish… was already fulfilled a little over four months ago,” Qin Chu said as he gently looked at the side of Huo Mian’s face.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":387,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:07.753","Link":"chapter-387-a-mini-honey-moon-9-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 387 - A Mini Honey Moon (9)"},{"ID":18112095183019333,"Name":"Chapter 388 -  A Mini Honey Moon (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 388 -  A Mini Honey Moon (10)","Description":"<p></p><h3 id=\"chapter388aminihoneymoon10\">Chapter 388: A Mini Honey Moon (10)</h3><h6 id=\"translatornoodletowntranslatededitornoodletowntranslated-3\">Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</h6><p></p><p>Huo Mian slowly opened her eyes when she heard what he said, and her eyes met with Qin Chu’s with great sentiment…</p><p>“Sheesh, here we go again, they’re going to show off their love again.

Don’t touch me, you filthy cop!” Zhu Lingling clearly wasn’t done making her wish yet, so naturally, she was upset when Gao Ran pulled her.</p><p>“What did you wish for?” Qin Chu walked over and wrapped an arm around Huo Mian’s shoulder.</p><p>“It’s a secret.”</p><p>“Tell me, maybe I can help you make it come true.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t be a wish if it’s easily fulfilled.” Huo Mian smiled mysteriously.</p><p>“Yeah, my wife is always right.”</p><p>The four were having a great time in the hotel garden, and the light décor on the streets before the hotel were all quite unique.</p><p>They were like rays of rainbows, which seemed very breathtaking, as seven colors interchanged nonstop…</p><p>“Since it’s so nice today, why don’t we play a game?” Zhu Lingling proposed.</p><p>“Sure, what are we playing?” Asked Huo Mian as she laughed.</p><p>“Let’s count the words ‘Ping-Pong ball’, whoever gets it wrong has to jump into that fountain. Are you guys up for it?”</p><p>Gao Ran said with great excitement, as he pointed to the pond before them, which was no more than half a meter deep.</p><p>“Sure.” Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>“I’m in as well.” Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>“I’m don’t mind either, let’s play. I’m not scared of you.” Zhu Lingling raised her chin and seemed defiant.</p><p>“Then I’ll start first.”</p><p>Gao Ran immediately said, “Ping”.</p><p>Qin Chu, “Pong.”</p><p>Huo Mian, “Ball.”</p><p>Zhu Lingling, “Ball.”</p><p>“You should say ‘Ping’, I just said ‘Ball’.” Huo Mian looked at Zhu Lingling hopelessly.</p><p>Zhu Lingling had always had the slowest reaction out of the four of them, each and every time they played word games.</p><p>This was true seven years ago and still remained true seven years later…</p><p>“I made a mistake, this turn doesn’t count. Let’s do another round.” Zhu Lingling denied it.</p><p>“That’s cheating, look, you should hop into the pond, or else everyone will think it’s unfair,” Huo Mian said on purpose.</p><p>“That’s right. If everyone says it doesn’t count when they lose, then what’s the point?” Qin Chu followed suit.</p><p>“You two are really trying to send me into the water…” Zhu Lingling gritted her teeth from anger.</p><p>Just as she held up her dress and prepared to jump into the pond, Gao Ran suddenly said, “Wait, let me jump in for you. Your dress isn’t so convenient, it would be terrible if you trip and drown.”</p><p>“What? Do you know how to talk? You’re the one that will drown…” Zhu Lingling rolled her eyes from the same anger.</p><p>Just then, Gao Ran bravely jumped into the pond with a ‘psshhhh’ sound and water splashed out.</p><p>Huo Mian suddenly clapped and shouted, “How manly!”</p><p>“Of course… I didn’t learn anything else at the police academy, all we learned was how to torture ourselves,” Gao Ran replied as he wiped the water off his face.</p><p>Truth be told, Zhu Lingling was quite moved when Gao Ran jumped in for her.</p><p>Even though it was only a game, she was still surprised by what he did.</p><p>“What a hero you are for saving the damsel in distress. I give you nine points out of ten, and the last point is reserved so that you don’t get too proud,” Qin Chu said as he looked at Gao Ran.</p><p>The four played four rounds, and Zhu Lingling lost three rounds, but luckily Gao Ran helped her out, so he was the one that was completely soaked in the end.</p><p>As the four tiredly walked back into the hotel and headed back to their rooms, Huo Mian suddenly whispered a question into Qin Chu’s ear, “Mr. Qin, I want to know, how many rooms did you get for those two today?”</p><p>“Guess.” Qin Chu slightly raised the corners of his lips.</p><p>Noodletown_ Noodletown_ So my girlfriend and I (Cucumber), and the two other founders (Udon and Black Bean Sauce) at Noodletown are going on a cruise trip in December.

She had known Qin Chu for quite some time now, and they dated at a young age, so she was able to predict most of his thoughts.</p><p>“I did ask them to prepare two rooms, but…”</p><p>At that thought, Qin Chu stopped speaking…</p><p>“What?” Huo Mian was confused, could there be something else to it?</p><p>“Nothing, let’s see how it goes. I think it’ll get very interesting.” Qin Chu slightly lifted the corners of his mouth.</p><p>They were all on the same floor, the 18th floor, and both Zhu Lingling and Gao Ran were given room cards to their presidential suites. Qin Chu was very generous.</p><p>When Zhu Lingling entered her room, she screamed out loud…</p><p>Gao Ran immediately ran over when he heard the noise…</p><p>He noticed that the lights in Zhu Lingling’s room were broken, and none of them could light up… (TL Note: true iron lady)</p><p>She called the front desk, and they said that an electrician would come to repair it. However, since it was very late already, the electrician went back to the village to sleep, and it would take some time to get here on a bike. They waited around for half an hour before Zhu Lingling finally lost her patience.</p><p>“I can’t wait anymore, I’m too tired, just get me another room.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, there aren’t any other empty rooms,” replied the receptionist.</p><p>Zhu Lingling was oddly surprised, “I’m fine with other rooms, it doesn’t have to be the presidential suite.”</p><p>“Sorry, we’re fully booked tonight for all the rooms.”</p><p>“Are you kidding me? You’ve got eighteen floors here, and at least seven to eight hundred rooms. How could you be all booked up?” Zhu Lingling was filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Even though we have a lot of rooms, but because of the President’s charity gala tonight, there are a lot of guests that are staying over. We might have an empty room tomorrow.”</p><p>“Tomorrow? Then am I sleeping by the front desk tonight?” Zhu Lingling was pissed.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Miss. Zhu, why don’t you stay with your friend tonight?” asked the receptionist kindly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Gao Ran immediately replied, “I’ve got a presidential suite as well, and there are at least three bedrooms. It’s very convenient.”</p><p>“Yes Ms. Zhu, the presidential suite is very large and very private. You could stay in your friend’s room, and return to your suite tomorrow once the electrician fixes the lights. Is that okay?”</p><p>The front desk receptionist was being extremely polite the entire time because she knew that Zhu Lingling was a friend of the president….</p><p>What the receptionist said made sense, and soon Zhu Lingling was convinced.</p><p>“Fine, then I’ll stay in your room for a night, but let me warn you, don’t get any ideas…” Zhu Lingling felt cautious when she thought of what happened at the hotel last time.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t do anything even if you beg me. I was drunk last time, okay?” Gao Ran felt helpless.</p><p>Zhu Lingling settled down when she heard what Gao Ran said…</p><p>So, late at night, she walked over to Gao Ran’s room, located beside hers, in PJs…</p><p>– Inside another presidential suite –</p><p>Huo Mian lied on the soft bed and asked Qin Chu with a smile, “So… is it really okay for you to plot like this? If Lingling found out that you did this on purpose, she would definitely try to kill you.”</p><p>“Why would she kill me?

How could you sneakily watch me bathe so proudly?” Huo Mian laughed because of how angry she was.</p><p>“We’re husband and wife, there’s no such thing as ‘sneakily watching you’. It’s all legal now,” Qin Chu placed down the laptop and spoke righteously.</p><p>“Okay, then Mr. Qin, can you get out now? I’m going to begin bathing.”</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because… I want to help you,” After Qin Chu spoke, he walked over and directly placed his hand in the bubble bath.</p><p>“Ah…” Huo Mian screamed out loud.</p><p>The two played around inside the bathtub, and water splashed everywhere.</p><p>Once Qin Chu carried Huo Mian out of the water, it was already half past midnight.</p><p>The towel that was wrapped around Huo Mian fell to the ground, and under the dim lights, her perfect female figure couldn’t be more seductive.</p><p>Qin Chu’s eyes grew deep as he looked at her…</p><p>“Mian…” His voice grew rusty, containing a deadly seductive power.</p><p>Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu with deep sentiments…</p><p>She knew what was about to come…</p><p>“Can I?” Mr. Qin didn’t want to upset Huo Mian, so he even asked first.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded embarrassingly…</p><p>Her crisp white fingertips slid past his lips, and continued down to his neck…</p><p>Qin Chu swallowed, as the knot in the throat clearly moved. He thought that he was an extremely determined man, and didn’t have strong interests in anything, except Huo Mian. She was a poison that he could never get off of his whole life, and it had already corroded away his heart and body.</p><p>Inside the yellowish-white round curtains, two shadows intertwined, and even their breathing became hurried.</p><p>Qin Chu was no longer the impulsive youth from seven years ago, and Huo Mian was no longer an inexperienced girl.</p><p>They’ve both matured, and became so mature that even when they joined together for the first time in seven years, it was in such harmony…</p><p>Qin Chu kissed her slowly and lightly as if he was worshipping a godlike thing. He wanted to slowly taste her.</p><p>His hand continued down, in search of many unknown regions…</p><p>Huo Mian felt her body temperature rise, and her face grew redder and redder… She even had a hard time breathing.</p><p>Her leg wrapped around Qin Chu’s sturdy waist, while her hand was placed around his neck.

Is that why you got up so late?”</p><p>Of course, Gao Ran was the only one who would say such shameless things…</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t talk back like usual; instead, her face grew red…</p><p>Zhu Lingling immediately noticed her abnormality, and she carefully pulled Huo Mian’s hand and quietly asked, “What happened last night?”</p><p>“Nothing happened.”</p><p>“That’s impossible, did you guys do it?” Zhu Lingling asked again.</p><p>“Do your head, hurry up and eat! Stop talking.” Huo Mian was pissed from embarrassment and refused to go on with Zhu Lingling.</p><p>Gao Ran continued to tease Qin Chu, “You’re in good shape Mr. Qin, you’re still able to get up today after your intense battle last night.”</p><p>Qin Chu calmly replied, “My kidney has always been decent, unlike you. You have to eat six boxes of supplements to get it up.”</p><p>“Ha… how is that possible? I’m in great shape; I don’t need those so-called supplements.

Didn’t you personally invite me to your suite? Did you think I wanted to go? I’ve realized, you’re a two-sided rotten cop, who acts like one person in front of some people and another behind others. How hypocritical.” Zhu Lingling was clearly mad.</p><p>“Yo, lady, I’m wrong, I didn’t mean it like that. I meant to tell Huo Mian that the two of us can’t compare with the two of them. We’ve both got work, I’ve got stuff to do at the police bureau, and she can’t push her things back, so we’ll head back early. I’ll come again once I’m on vacation, it’s so pretty here,” Gao Ran sighed.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll get someone to fill up your car with a tank of gas.” Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>“What about you guys? When are you going back?” asked Gao Ran.</p><p>“Maybe tomorrow, we’ll be home tomorrow night.”</p><p>“Okay, then let’s get together once you guys come back.”</p><p>After breakfast, Qin Chu ordered for Gao Ran’s car to be driven over, and then he saw off Gao Ran and Zhu Lingling.</p><p>Truth be told, Huo Mian didn’t want to see those two leave, but they had no choice.</p><p>They had to go to work, so after they left, Huo Mian pulled Qin Chu’s hand and asked, “Where are we going today?”</p><p>“We’re going deep into the mountains today.”</p><p>“Deep into the mountains?” Huo Mian froze.</p><p>She didn’t seem to know what sort of new plans Qin Chu came up with, but she has always been pleasantly surprised by his plans.</p><p>She has liked everything he planned… this was quite clear.</p><p>Qin Chu drove along the Yunding Mountain range with Huo Mian for about an hour or so.</p><p>The road became harder and harder to drive on, and just as Qin Chu stopped the car, he pointed towards an averagely sized opening and said, “We can’t drive up that road, so we’ll have to walk in.”</p><p>“Uhm… it looks dark, there shouldn’t be any ferocious beasts, right?” Huo Mian felt a bit scared.</p><p>“There aren’t any, trust me, I’m here.”</p><p>“That’s true, other beasts won’t show up with you around, because you’re the biggest beast of them all.” Huo Mian covered her mouth as she laughed.</p><p>Qin Chu, “…”</p><p>“You’re pretty arrogant, just wait to see how I punish you tonight.” Qin Chu raised his finger and flicked Huo Mian’s head dotingly.</p><p>“I’m on my period, you can’t…” Huo Mian was full of pride.</p><p>“Huh? Honey, you seemed to be mistaken, when I said punish, I meant tickling you.”</p><p>“Uhm… that.” Huo Mian felt somewhat awkward.</p><p>“What else did you think I was talking about?’ Qin Chu smiled teasingly.</p><p>“Nothing, come, hurry up, what are we waiting for?” Huo Mian changed her tone and topic when she realized that she couldn’t beat Qin Chu.</p><p>Qin Chu and Huo Mian held hands as they walked into the mountains…</p><p>The mountain path was very rugged, but it became more interesting when they saw there were wooden steps.</p><p>“These steps are beautiful, they must have been pricey to build,” Huo Mian exclaimed as she looked down.</p><p>“These finished not long ago. I got them to design it, and it was expensive to build. Normal wood wouldn’t do the job since it would corrode over long periods of time and become too dangerous, so I ordered them to carefully craft these stairs with special wood.”</p><p>“Huh? You ordered someone to design it…? Why?” Huo Mian was confused.</p><p>Huo Mian thought that Qin Chu wasn’t such a careless big spender who would use large amounts of money to build stairs inside the depth of the woods.</p><p>There must be a reason behind his actions…</p><p>“Because… you’ll find out when you see it.” Qin Chu remained mysterious, refusing to tell her why.</p><p>“Ever since we came to Yunding Mountain, you’ve always been acting all mysterious around me.” Huo Mian looked at Qin Chu as she thought it was funny. She had no idea what he planned on doing.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":392,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:10.223","Link":"chapter-392-sudden-change-within-one-night-2-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 392 - Sudden Change Within One Night (2)"},{"ID":181120951107544426,"Name":"Chapter 393 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 393 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (3)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 393: Sudden Change Within One Night (3)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Huo Mian knew that he was acting all mysterious again, and there might be another surprise that was to come.</p><p>After they walked about three miles of the mountain path, Huo Mian was shocked by the beautiful scenery in front of her eyes…</p><p>Yellow tree leafs filled both sides of the path, and because birch trees turned golden in the fall, it was very beautiful.</p><p>However, after three miles, the yellow suddenly turned into a sea of deep red…</p><p>It was as if a spell was cast upon this area…</p><p>“My gosh, it’s gorgeous…” Huo Mian looked at the red leaves around her as she spun around. She felt like she was inside a fairy-tale.</p><p>Qin Chu raised his head and said as he looked at those trees, “These are birch trees. Each and every fall, the leaves will turn deep red for half a month. It’s very beautiful, and those who work in the hotel also live here, so I thought that it was nice when they told me about this place. I bought this piece of land, and I want to turn it into a maple leaf tourist area. But to maintain the natural beauty of these trees, it would only be open to the public for fifteen days each year and only accept two hundred tourists each day.”</p><p>Huo Mian raised her thumb. “Good idea, I’ll give you tons of likes.”</p><p>“Do you like it?”</p><p>“I do… it’s gorgeous here, I never imagined that a place like this existed. If I walked around this path in the woods during a rainy day, it would be so romantic with the red leaves and small drops of rain….”</p><p>Qin Chu felt truly happy when he saw Huo Mian in such joy.</p><p>“Hubby, when we’re old, let’s build a wooden mansion here, and live within the depth of these red leaves. We can have a bunch of chickens, ducks, and geese, along with a dog, and eat naturally-grown, non-polluted greens… Wouldn’t that be heavenly?”</p><p>“We’ll also have a bunch of kids, then it’ll be more lively,” Qin Chu added.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately rolled her eyes at him, “Do you think I’m a pig? A bunch?”</p><p>“Let’s have enough babies for a whole soccer team. I will definitely want them to try out for the World Cup,” teased Qin Chu.</p><p>Huo Mian burst out in laughter…</p><p>She lowered her head, picked up a red leaf, and placed it on her left eye. It was extremely beautiful…</p><p>Qin Chu couldn’t help it but take out his phone, and with a ‘snap’, he captured this alluring moment…</p><p>“It’s stunning, why aren’t you taking photos?” Qin Chu reminded her.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, “Many beautiful sceneries can’t be captured in a photo, you have to personally be in it and actually see it to truly enjoy it. Sometimes your eyes are the best cameras.”</p><p>“You’re always right, honey.” Qin Chu smiled and placed the phone back into his pockets.</p><p>It might be because that Huo Mian was in such a good mood that she ran a few steps up the stairs…</p><p>“Mian, come back, you can’t go there,” Qin Chu warned as his expressions slightly changed.</p><p>“Why not? Did you hide a lover of yours in the depth of the woods? Hiding away the beauty in some mansion? Huh?” Huo Mian laughed as she ran up two steps at a time, and Qin Chu couldn’t stop her, so he had no choice but to follow closely behind.</p><p>“Hiding some beauty in a mansion? How could you even think of that, what a tale…” Qin Chu felt helpless. He followed her closely worried that something would happen to her.</p><p>After all, this mountain region had only been developed recently, so it wasn’t very safe yet. Within the first five miles was the shallow mountain region, where small squirrels, monkeys, or other kinds of small wild animals lived. But if one continued onwards, there might be unknown dangers.</p><p>Even though he hadn’t heard of tigers or black bears appearing nearby, it was better to be careful…</p><p>Huo Mian ran a mile in one breath, and as she grew tired, she stopped and breathed in huge breaths of fresh air.</p><p>Suddenly a colorful thing beside a tree on the bottom left corner caught her eye. It was round.</p><p>“What a cute little mushroom.” She lowered her body and reached out to pick it.</p><p>Qin Chu, a few steps behind her, saw this. Terrified, he exclaimed, “Mian, don’t!”</p><p>Huo Mian immediately stopped her movements, and just then the round thing spread out, one curve after another…</p><p>Then, it spat out a deep red tongue…</p><p>“Ahh, a snake!” Huo Mian screamed out. Perhaps it would’ve been better if she didn’t scream, because when she did, it terrified that little snake, causing it to immediately leap up towards Huo Mian’s arm.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":393,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:10.757","Link":"chapter-393-sudden-change-within-one-night-3-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 393 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (3)"},{"ID":181120951112141013,"Name":"Chapter 394 - Sudden Change Within One Night (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 394 - Sudden Change Within One Night (4)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 394: Sudden Change Within One Night (4)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>Due to the emergency, Qin Chu flew over and protected Huo Mian. The little snake ended up biting into Qin Chu’s arm.</p><p>Luckily, it was fall and was a bit cold in the morning, so Qin Chu wore a light grey long sleeve shirt, and the clothing protected him by quite a bit…</p><p>With his other hand, Qin Chu carefully pinched the little snake, and then slowly placed it on the ground before suddenly letting go…</p><p>The little snake seemed to have been frightened, as it waved its tail, and hid away into the grass with a ‘swoosh’.</p><p>“You’ve been bit, let me take a look.” Huo Mian’s expression dramatically changed as she pulled up Qin Chu’s sleeve.</p><p>She could clearly two teeth prints with blood slowly flowing out…</p><p>“It’s all my fault, you were bitten because of me. Let me get the congested blood out first, it might hurt, but it’ll be over soon.” After Huo Mian spoke, she forcefully pressed down with both her hands, causing the blood to flow out.</p><p>“Are you going to suck out the poison for me? That’s what they do on T.V.,” Qin Chu said.</p><p>“Why would I do that? What if this snake is a deadly poisonous one? I will die for sure,” Huo Mian calmly said.</p><p>Qin Chu, “…”</p><p>“So you want to wait until I die, and run off with my tens of millions of assets, Mrs. Qin?” Qin Chu calmly looked at Huo Mian.</p><p>“Okay, both of us have studied medicine. Sure you could trick others, but you can’t trick me. This snake is a pine-flower snake, or otherwise called the cauliflower Snake. It’s very ferocious but isn’t poisonous. Its main attribute is its massive physique, and many are as thick as a bowl opening, so it’s also called the pine-flower python. This type of snake can be found in ten or so provinces in our country, and that one we just saw was clearly a recently born little snake, so it’s fine. I’ve done research on this type of snake during a summer internship when I was in medical school.”</p><p>Qin Chu was hopeless at how calm Huo Mian sounded.</p><p>Finally, he calmly sighed, “So, it’s no fun marrying such a rational wife.”</p><p>“I made a mistake, that little guy wrapped itself around, and was all round, so I thought it was a small mushroom before getting a closer look, but why would you run up when you knew what kind of snake it was? It wasn’t poisonous.” Huo Mian felt bad, as she took out a water bottle to rinse Qin Chu’s wounds and a tissue to lightly dab at it.</p><p>“I didn’t want you to get bit, it would hurt,” replied Qin Chu as if he was wronged.</p><p>Huo Mian felt very moved; Qin Chu didn’t want her to suffer even one bit of pain.</p><p>Clearly, he had spoiled her rotten to an extreme extent, no wonder Gao Ran and Lingling often said that it was tormenting to watch how overly protectively Qin Chu was to his wife.</p><p>After she took care of the wounds, Huo Mian held onto Qin Chu’s arm and they walked down the mountain together…</p><p>“Honey, do you know why people are scared to see snakes? Even if they knew it wasn’t poisonous, and even if it was only a small snake, they will still be scared when they see it,” asked Huo Mian in all seriousness.</p><p>“Gut response maybe,” Qin Chu replied carelessly.</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head instead, “Gut response means that one would be scared if they often see snakes and are bitten by snakes, but many are scared even if it’s the first time they see a snake. This is called genetic influence, something that happens during evolution.”</p><p>“I’ve seen my mentor in America especially write essays on this topic, but I wasn’t interested, so I never looked into it,” Qin Chu slowly replied.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded, “I’ve read that report. The scientist first placed a lab rat into a glass room. Then they placed white smoke, and the rat didn’t respond to it. Later, when they put in the white smoke, they would also electrically shock the rat, and then the rat would gradually become terrified of the white smoke. Once the rat produced its third generation, they no longer needed to electrically shock them for them to be scared of the white smoke. This means that humans must have been bitten by snakes hundreds of thousands of times when we were just evolving into humans from apes. Therefore, whenever later generations see snakes, they would be terrified from deep within. This is an evolutionary theory, don’t you think it’s cool?”</p><p>“It is… Mother Nature is too mysterious, human beings only know the tip of the iceberg,” Qin Chu also exclaimed.</p><p>However, it was peculiar that the couple could profoundly discuss an evolutionary theory just because of a tiny snake bite…</p><p>If an academically-achieved husband married an academically-achieved wife, their mundane lives would become even more fulfilling and interesting…</p><p>Qin Chu received a call when the two returned to the hotel, and then his expressions turned ugly.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“I have to head back now, something happened at GK.” Qin Chu’s looked concerned.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":394,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:11.217","Link":"chapter-394-sudden-change-within-one-night-4-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 394 - Sudden Change Within One Night (4)"},{"ID":181120951117043139,"Name":"Chapter 395 - Sudden Change Within One Night (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 395 - Sudden Change Within One Night (5)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 395: Sudden Change Within One Night (5)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Okay.” Huo Mian nodded; she knew that it was an emergency, or else Qin Chu wouldn’t be this concerned.</p><p>Qin Chu sped back to C City, only taking four hours for a five-hour trip.</p><p>The sun didn’t even set when they arrived at C City…</p><p>“I will head to the company now, you should head home first and rest,” Qin Chu softly said.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded and got off the car at the gates of Imperial Park…</p><p>Qin Chu drove to the company’s headquarters.</p><p>“Dad, why did you need me in such a hurry?” Qin Chu saw his father sitting on his own office chair as soon as he entered.

There is also a shortage of teachers.”</p><p>“What does that have to do with you? That’s the government’s problem, you’re only a businessman; your job is to earn money, expand GK’s market, and increase sales. Why would you put in so much effort into charity work? Each year, GK symbolically donates an amount of money, but there’s no need to take charity so seriously. You’re a businessman, not a saint, do you understand?”</p><p>Qin Yumin was obviously furious that his son made this decision without consulting him. Even though fifty million wasn’t a big amount, he was very uncomfortable that his son had spent an amount like this on charity.</p><p>“Dad… you’re very knowledgeable and talented, so you must know that the money spent will find its way back. There’s endless money to be earned, but our life is limited, why can’t we do something else that’s within our ability? Yunding Mountain is a major project of mine, and once it’s developed, the money will pour in endlessly. But, we should bring prosperity to the locals, and not a disaster that destroys their homes… We are businessmen, and we are in it for the money, but I think that there’s nothing wrong with doing good for the general public while earning money.”</p><p>“Don’t you argue with me, You would never suddenly do something this for no reason. Truth be told, was it Huo Mian’s idea? Did she push you? Only poor peasants like her would want to do things like this.” Qin Yumin was certain that his son was dating Huo Mian, and so he blamed everything on her.</p><p>Qin Chu was upset when he heard his father blame Huo Mian, “Dad, it’s completely my idea, it has nothing to do with Huo Mian.”</p><p>“Don’t try to trick me, do you think that I don’t know? You even named it the Mian Foundation. What a joke, son… just look at yourself, is this something a businessman like you should be doing?” Qin Yumin slapped the table in anger.</p><p>“I admit the charity was named after her, but that only shows how important she is to me,” Qin Chu uprightly admitted.</p><p>“Fool… I’ve already contacted the Financial Department to pull back the fifty million, the money shouldn’t be used on redundant projects.”</p><p>“Dad, you can’t do that. I’m the President, while you’re already half-retired, you shouldn’t interfere too much,” Qin Chu stared at his father and warned in all seriousness.</p><p>“Chu, I admit that you’re a brilliant businessman who is good at making money, but you’re still very immature sometimes, and I don’t agree with this project. I won’t approve of this, that’s it.”</p><p>Qin Yumin seemed determined to reject the establishment of the Mian Foundation.</p><p>“Then fine, Dad, then I’d like to officially resign.”</p><p>“What?” Qin Yumin suddenly turned around and stared at his son in fury.</p><p>(TL Note: For beginners, we made a video on how to get all the free spirit stones!

You and grandpa built GK from scratch, and I was lucky enough to be born into the Qin family. GK doesn’t belong to me, and I never wanted it for myself. I can leave this place with Huo Mian and start over again in another city. I’m still young, and there are lots of things that I still haven’t tried yet. If you can give me this opportunity, I will be extremely grateful.”</p><p>Qin Chu’s eyes filled with sincererity when he said this</p><p>This wasn’t something he said to purposefully agitate his father; this thought had been on his mind for a while now.</p><p>He never really wanted to be the GK’s president. However, it was a family business, and therefore he had no choice but to step up and take responsibility.</p><p>But, if his father said for himself that he didn’t need to take over GK, then that’s good; he’ll be completely free.</p><p>With his current status as an MD who graduated from Harvard’s Medical School, his and Huo Mian’s lives would be set if they were to open a hospital.</p><p>So money, fame, and status were not at all appealing to him…</p><p>“You’re my only son. I can’t believe that you would say something like this. Your mother and I spent so much effort raising you, and that’s how you are going to repay us?”</p><p>“I thank you and my mom for giving birth to me, I truly am grateful for that. It’s just that, over these years, you guys seemed to have intervened in my life too many times, and I nearly lost what’s nearest and dearest to my heart. Dad, I’m not you, so I can’t feel what you feel, and I don’t want to say how much I hate you and mother for what you’ve done. However the truth is, growing up, I’ve been hurt more times than any other child, all because of the two of you. Up until today, I still respected your decisions and opinions, but there’s only one thing I have left to say to you. If the charity isn’t approved, then I will immediately resign And if you ever disapprove of any of my decisions later on, I will still immediately resign”</p><p>“You?” Qin Yumin was overwhelmed with rage as he looked at the son that he and his wife raised for almost thirty years.</p><p>“Qin Chu, you’ve disappointed me too much,” Qin Yumin said profoundly as he looked at his son.</p><p>“Truth be told, Dad. You and mother have disappointed me as well, but I don’t blame you.”</p><p>“So you’re never going to give up on Huo Mian? No matter what I say?” Qin Yumin made one last attempt.</p><p>After Qin Chu hesitated for three seconds, he slowly looked up and said, “Dad, I’ve already married Huo Mian.”</p><p>“What?” Qin Yumin stumbled back several steps and looked at his son, his eyes widened with shock.</p><p>Qin Chu added, “We’re really married, even though there wasn’t a wedding, we are already registered at the Civil Affairs Bureau, so Huo Mian and I are legally married, making Huo Mian my wife. How could I ever give up on my most beloved wife?”</p><p>Qin Yumin’s chest raced like a motor when he suddenly heard the news that his son was married</p><p>He couldn’t digest it all at once…</p><p>He only just tried to convince his son to give up on that unworthy peasant girl.</p><p>Qin Yumin always felt like Huo Mian had sway over Qin Chu’s thoughts and made him more peasant-like.</p><p>He was no longer cold, no longer decisive, and no longer like a merciless businessman</p><p>“You when did you two get married?” Qin Yumin asked each word with extreme difficulty.</p><p>“A little over four months ago not long after I returned to China,” Qin Chu faintly replied.</p><p>Qin Yumin felt his head explode and he momentarily lost his ability to think; the shock was just too much for him to handle.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":396,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:12.27","Link":"chapter-396-sudden-change-within-one-night-6-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 396 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (6)"},{"ID":1811209511315408,"Name":"Chapter 397 - Sudden Change Within One Night (7)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 397 - Sudden Change Within One Night (7)","Description":"<p></p><h3>Chapter 397: Sudden Change Within One Night (7)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p><p>Qin Chu pondered for a moment and continued, “You can have a day to think this over, Dad. If you respect my decision, then I will continue to work at GK. However, if you question my abilities and believe that I am too impulsive and reckless, then starting tomorrow, I will no longer work at GK. I very much appreciate the opportunity you have given me, take care.”</p><p>Qin Chu turned on his heel and walked out as he finished speaking. Qin Yumin fell back to his office chair in defeat…</p><p>“You have an important meeting soon, Sir,” Yang said anxiously when he saw Qin Chu walking out.</p><p>“Having the chairman is enough.” Qin Chu threw in his words lightly and left the corporation.</p><p>Huo Mian was in the midst of cleaning when Qin Chu arrived home…</p><p>She wore a cartoon apron and was in the middle of mopping the floors. Having a big condo was great and all, but cleaning it sure took a long time.</p><p>She had been cleaning for a while but still hadn’t finished the first floor. However, it was her house after all, so everything she was doing was enjoyable.</p><p>As she mopped, she hummed the theme song of Bonnie Bear without a care in the world.</p><p>She looked up as soon as Qin Chu walked in the door, “You’re home early! I thought you would be working until midnight again.”</p><p>“Why are you doing all this?” Qin Chu walked over in a couple of steps and grabbed the mop from Huo Mian’s hands.</p><p>“It’s not like I had anything else to do. We haven’t been home in a couple of days and the house was getting dusty. We are germophobic, haha, we can’t allow for any messes!” She chuckled.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be cleaning, you’re on your period. I can hire a cleaner for this.” Qin Chu’s heart ached.</p><p>“Oh c’mon, Mr. Qin, I’m not a princess! It’s a period, not pregnancy. These are not tough chores, it’s not a big deal.”</p><p>“Even so, be a good girl.” Qin Chu held onto Huo Mian’s hand and led her to the sofa.</p><p>He then took off his jacket quietly and began mopping…</p><p>“This is not something that a man should do, put that down!” Huo Mian genuinely thought Qin Chu was unsuited to do these chores.</p><p>“This is my home as well, why can’t I do it? You should rest, leave it all to me.”</p><p>Qin Chu was an extremely efficient person. The first floor was spotless in no time, even the corners were impeccable.</p><p>Finally, after cleaning, he sat down on the sofa and hugged Huo Mian with one arm. Suddenly, he felt light and content.</p><p>“What’s up? Did something good happen? You’re smirking.” Huo Mian wondered.</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“What is it? Can you share it with me?”</p><p>“Would you still like me if I was no longer the president of GK?” Qin Chu teased Huo Mian intentionally.</p><p>“Of course not! Why would anyone like you when you’re not the president?”</p><p>Qin Chu was speechless.</p><p>“No, seriously. I have a great plan! If I’m no longer the president, we can use the money we’ve saved up and spend a year traveling around the world. We can then settle down somewhere with beautiful scenery. Whether it is a small town, a village, or a big city, as long as we like it, we can open a private hospital there. I will be the doctor, and you can be the nurse.”</p><p>“No, I want to be the hospital director!” Huo Mian interrupted happily.</p><p>“Okay, you can be the director and I will be the deputy director. We will spend the rest of our lives in peace and happiness.”</p><p>“Sounds like a good plan, in theory. But you’re the only child in your family, who’s going to be the president then? Don’t tell me your dad is thinking of selling GK.”</p><p>“Nope.” Qin Chu shook his head.</p><p>Huo Mian rested her head on Qin Chu’s shoulder and asked gently, “Did you have a fight with your father?”</p><p>“Not much of a fight, more like a small argument…” Qin Chu said honestly.</p><p>“Was it because of me?” Huo Mian squirmed a little closer to Qin Chu.</p><p>Qin Chu looked down and stroked her hair affectionally, “Mrs. Qin, can you be anymore smarter?”</p><p>“I’m guessing it’s because of the Mian Foundation? Maybe you should name it something else, it’s a big deal…”</p><p>“That’s not the problem, don’t worry,” Qin Chu comforted her.</p><p>“But…” Huo Mian continued but was immediately interrupted by Qin Chu.</p><p>“Honey, when is your Aunt Flo leaving?” Qin Chu eagerly asked.

I am a good law-abiding citizen…” Qin Chu replied in all seriousness. (TL Note: running red lights is another saying for having the boink boink when the woman’s period isn’t over.)</p><p>Running red lights? Huo Mian didn’t know if she should laugh or cry at the fact that he would come up with such a dirty thought…</p><p>The two of them went to Ah-Xin’s Ramen for dinner, and during that time, they called the residential district management to have some cleaners tidy up their condo.</p><p>Huo Mian had no idea that she would see Su Yu at Ah-Xin’s ramen. After all, someone with his identity would never come to a place like this.</p><p>– Inside the Ramen House –</p><p>“Don’t mind me saying this, but why the heck are you eating ramen here? Gosh, Master Su, what’s wrong with you?” Wei Liao was someone with a reversed biological clock. He was always out partying during the night and sleeping in during the day. However, before he even had the chance to wake up, Su Yu pulled him out to eat at this ‘authentic’ restaurant.</p><p>It wasn’t until they arrived that he realized it was a tiny ghetto ramen house in a street behind a high school.</p><p>The most speechless thing was the fact that a bowl of ramen only cost two yuan.</p><p>“Quit talking and eat,” Su Yu said impatiently.</p><p>“Don’t tell me the authenticity of this place is the price, two yuan per bowl? Are you short on money? Is your company having cash flow issues? Haha, c’mon you can tell me, I can recommend you a place to sell as*,” Wei Liao ridiculed.</p><p>Su Yu didn’t say anything and continued to eat his ramen in silence…</p><p>Wei Liao noticed that he was a little odd today…</p><p>He was just about to tease Su Yu a little more when he saw Qin Chu and Huo Mian walk in hand in hand, in a very intimate fashion.</p><p>Huo Mian wore a black leather jacket with a white t-shirt underneath. She paired it with a dark pair of jeans and a pair of kitten heels. Her hair was pulled up in a messy bun, and overall, holy crap was she cute!</p><p>Qin Chu was classy and elegant as usual, with his diamond cufflinks from South Africa…</p><p>In order to avoid unwanted attention, the couple usually took Huo Mian’s Volkswagen to places like this instead of Qin Chu’s Maybach.</p><p>“Ay! Look who’s here!”</p><p>Wei Liao signaled at Su Yu with his eyes…</p><p>When Su Yu turned around, he was initially a little stunned. But, he quickly turned back around and continued to eat his noodles.</p><p>Huo Mian saw Su Yu the moment she walked in, but she pretended like she didn’t, especially since she was with Qin Chu. She would never take the initiative and wave either, this was not her personality.</p><p>“Boss, two bowls of ramen,” Huo Mian ordered.</p><p>“Coming right up!”</p><p>“What do you want to drink, Master Qin?” Huo Mian got up and walked towards the cooler.</p><p>“Whatever you’re drinking,” Qin Chu replied tenderly.</p><p>Huo Mian smiled, she took out two glass bottles of soda and walked back to the table.</p><p>“I want something to drink too. You, go get me one,” Su Yu looked at Wei Liao and said.</p><p>Wei Liao imitated Huo Mian and asked, “What do you want to drink, Master Su?”</p><p>“Whatever that table’s drinking,” Su Yu said stubbornly.</p><p>Wei Liao smiled and walked over to the cooler…</p><p>“Would you like to go and say hi?” Qin Chu knew that Huo Mian knew Su Yu; she had mentioned it herself.</p><p>“No, I don’t know him very well.” Huo Mian shook her head and rejected.</p><p>Qin Chu didn’t say much else…</p><p>Su Yu finished his bowl of ramen in a couple of bites.</p><p>“Let’s go,” said Wei Liao as he got up.</p><p>“Boss, give me another bowl,” Su Yu called out to Ah-Xin, but he was actually staringdirectly at Huo Mian.</p><p>“What? We’re still eating? Master Su, please I’m about to throw up.” Wei Liao looked rather disgusted. Since they walked in the door, the two of them have had six bowls of ramen. Yes, it was two yuan per bowl, but did they really have to take such advantage of cheap stuff?</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":398,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:13.487","Link":"chapter-398-sudden-change-within-one-night-8-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 398 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (8)"},{"ID":181120951139711297,"Name":"Chapter 399 - Sudden Change Within One Night (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 399 - Sudden Change Within One Night (9)","Description":"<p></p><h3>Chapter 399: Sudden Change Within One Night (9)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p><p>“I’m still hungry,” Su Yu said stubbornly.</p><p>At this time, Ah-Xin walked out of the kitchen feeling slightly embarrassed, “Sir, the last two bowls of ramen have been purchased by the two customers here. There aren’t enough noodles for another bowl. It will take around twenty minutes for me to knead the dough. Is that okay?”</p><p>“No, I can’t wait,” Su Yu rejected Ah-Xin’s offer right up front.</p><p>“Oh, so what should we do?” Ah-Xin looked rather baffled.</p><p>Su Yu glanced over at Huo Mian and Qin Chu, stubbornly taking out his wallet and pulling out two hundred yuan, “Give me their noodles, I can pay you extra. It’s two yuan per bowl, right? I will give you two hundred, so give me their bowls.”</p><p>“Sir, it’s not a matter of money. They are our regular customers, it’s against policy…”</p><p>“My words are the policy,” Su Yu argued with Ah-Xin, unwilling to admit defeat.</p><p>“Ah-Xin, you can give him my bowl. I can share with Huo Mian,” Qin Chu said.</p><p>“Mr. Qin, won’t that be a bit…” Ah-Xin really appreciated Qin Chu’s offer, but at the same time, he felt terrible that this was happening to his customer.</p><p>“It’s not a problem,” said Qin Chu; he clearly didn’t mind.</p><p>However, before Ah-Xin could say anything else, Su Yu got up, “Mr. Qin is sure generous. If you can give your noodles to me, would you be willing to give away other things as well?”</p><p>“Just the noodles, and that still has to depend on my mood. Other things? Don’t even think about it,” Qin Chu said coldly.</p><p>“Haha and here I am, thinking you’re generous. You are a cheapskate after all.” Su Yu chuckled.</p><p>“Stop being so immature, Su Yu. If you’re done with your noodles than get the hell out. Stop looking for trouble here.” The moment Huo Mian walked in, Su Yu had been looking for trouble. She couldn’t take it anymore now that he was giving Qin Chu a hard time.</p><p>Su Yu glanced over at Huo Mian, wanting to say something, but he held his tongue…</p><p>Wei Liao pulled on Su Yu’s arm, “C’mon, let’s go. We have some business elsewhere.”</p><p>Finally, Su Yu stopped his bickering with Qin Chu and followed Wei Liao out…</p><p>“Su Yu’s like that, don’t worry about him. He can be very much like a kid when he’s acting immature,” Huo Mian said to Qin Chu.</p><p>“Okay,” Qin Chu nodded and said nothing else.</p><p>A ramen date went wrong, all thanks to Su Yu…</p><p>At least Qin Chu didn’t ask Huo Mian any follow-up questions, so she stopped worrying about the incident.</p><p>– Next morning –</p><p>Huo Mian drove her car to work. When she arrived at South Side, she noticed that her office was covered in red roses. Rows and rows of roses, at least several thousands of them scattered around the entire office.</p><p>“What is all this?” Huo Mian looked confused.</p><p>“I’m not sure. It came in the morning for you,” a nurse said with much envy.</p><p>Huo Mian was almost sure that it was Su Yu, no one else would do such a <a class=\"__cf_email__\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"661403122614020302\">[email protected]</a> thing.</p><p>Out of exasperation and rage, she tried to remember his phone number and punched it into her phone.</p><p>Su Yu, on the other hand, was still fast asleep. No one would dare disturb him at this hour in the morning, or else the consequence would be dire.</p><p>“How many times do I have to tell you, don’t call me in the morning! Do you want to die?” Su Yu shouted with his eyes still closed.</p><p>“Su Yu, stop sending flowers! You annoying prick!”</p><p>Su Yu’s eyes popped open with a hint of delight as soon as he heard Huo Mian’s voice.</p><p>“Hey, how did you know my number?”</p><p>“Dude, that’s not the point, alright? The point is, tell your people to stop sending flowers!” Huo Mian shouted back angrily.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><script data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js\"></script><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":399,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:13.973","Link":"chapter-399-sudden-change-within-one-night-9-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 399 - Sudden Change Within One Night (9)"},{"ID":181120951145709279,"Name":"Chapter 400 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 400 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (10)","Description":"<p></p><h3>Chapter 400: Sudden Change Within One Night (10)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p><p>“Why?

You’re severely disturbing my personal and work life, please stop!”</p><p>“Huo Mian, I’m sending you flowers because I like it.” Su Yu wanted to tell her it was because he liked her, but in the end, he couldn’t confess.</p><p>Even though he knew 100% that he was falling for Huo Mian, he was still slightly embarrassed to confess his feelings so straightforwardly.</p><p>“So I should like receiving flowers because you like to send them? What’s wrong with you! If you don’t stop, I’m going to key your goddamn Lamborghini.”</p><p>“Oh please, come and key any shape you like.” Su Yu chuckled even happier.</p><p>“Ugh! You’re so annoying!” Huo Mian hung up the phone angrily.</p><p>Su Yu was able to dig up much more information about Huo Mian, including her childhood, ever since Qin Chu’s people stopped shielding away the information.</p><p>It was only then that he found out Huo Mian was a child prodigy, and that she was a very smart and intelligent individual with a high IQ and EQ.</p><p>It was her relationship with Qin Chu that stirred up much sensation. Eventually, the misfortune brought on to her family led her to forgo the bright future that she was promised.</p><p>No wonder Huo Mian was so medically skilled. She was a medical genius who was meant to do great things, but reality suppressed her into nothing more than a nurse.</p><p>He also found out that Ah-Xin’s Ramen was one of Huo Mian’s favorite restaurants when she was going to school.</p><p>Huo Mian’s best friend was Zhu Lingling, and she was her only friend after all these years.</p><p>Huo Mian had a mother who lived in a poor area, and she ran a convenience store for a living.</p><p>Huo Mian had a little brother who was going to a local university, and she loved him dearly.</p><p>Huo Mian liked to wear simple and elegant clothes, and she didn’t like to wear makeup.Her go-to hairstyle was either a ponytail or a messy bun, but most of the time, she wore her hair down.</p><p>Huo Mian also had an ex-boyfriend that was an ophthalmologist.They’ve broken up, and he was now married.</p><p>Huo Mian was the most popular kid in class, not because of her looks, but because of her personality.</p><p>He realized that the more he knew about her, the deeper he fell for her. He was so interested in everything about her.</p><p>Yesterday, he didn’t just go to Ah-Xin’s Ramen to taste the noodles, he was having a taste of the years where he was absent during Huo Mian’s youth.</p><p>He wanted to walk the roads she walked, speak to the people that she spoke to, and have a feel of the crazy things that she had done in the past…</p><p>Holy sh*t, when did I become such an emotional and artsy douche? Su Yu thought to himself alarmingly.</p><p>Su Yu’s actions made Huo Mian’s head throb. He liked doing very immature things.</p><p>Like intentionally rear-ending her…</p><p>Like sending her pig’s feet as a midnight snack…</p><p>Like filling her office with countless roses in the morning…</p><p>He surely thought those gestures were romantic, but to Huo Mian, he was just being unbelievably immature.</p><p>Huo Mian stared at the rose-covered floors and couldn’t stand it anymore, “Can you guys help me throw out all these flowers?”</p><p>“What? That’s such a waste!”</p><p>“Then send every department a batch of flowers, and say it’s a gift from South Side,” Huo Mian ordered.</p><p>Huo Mian’s phone began ringing before the nurses could say anything. It was a video call coming from Qin Chu.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Qin.” Huo Mian closed her office door since she was video-chatting.</p><p>“Are you busy?”</p><p>“Not yet, I just got here, but I do have a lot of documents that I need to organize.”</p><p>“I forgot to make you ginger and brown-sugar-water this one morning, I’ll ask someone to send you some later.”</p><p>“It’s okay, I have some at the office, I can make myself a cup.” Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>“Why are there so many flowers behind you?” Qin Chu suddenly noticed the sea of flowers behind her.</p><p>“Hm It’s a gift from South Side, and it will be sent to each department and clinic in a bit.”</p><p>“Your hospital gave you guys red roses as gifts?” Qin Chu asked sharply.</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":400,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:14.573","Link":"chapter-400-sudden-change-within-one-night-10-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 400 -  Sudden Change Within One Night (10)"},{"ID":181120951156778200,"Name":"Chapter 401 - The First Silent Treatment (1)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 401 - The First Silent Treatment (1)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 401: The First Silent Treatment (1)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“Hm… our hospital director has an exquisite taste.” Huo Mian laughed awkwardly.</p><p>He knew how Huo Mian felt about Su Yu, so he stopped asking as he was not worried.</p><p>“When do you get off work today?”</p><p>“I’m not sure yet, I took three days off, so there’s quite a bit of work piled up.” Huo Mian’s head throbbed as she stared at the pile of reports.</p><p>“Let’s eat together if you get off early.”</p><p>“Okay.” Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>“Remember to drink some ginger and brown-sugarwater,” Qin Chu reminded her with much seriousness in his voice.</p><p>“Yes Mom…” Qin Chu was often a miser with words, but when it came to Huo Mian, he always managed to become a nagging mother. Huo Mian was speechless.</p><p>The two of them got busy with their own work after hanging up.</p><p>In the afternoon, Huo Mian received a notice from the Finance Department that the Engineering Department will be using money from the Huo Foundation to service the hospital’s back garden.</p><p>Huo Mian immediately took off her lab coat and headed towards the Engineering Department.</p><p>Feng Yiqing, the director of the Engineering Department, was said to be Deputy Director Guo’s brother-in-law. He was a man that abused his power and bullied others, and he was a rather arrogant person.</p><p>Rumor had it that he would frequently use public funds for himself. Deputy Director Guo usually looked the other way since the amount was never too large.</p><p>In terms of other people in the hospital, they were much too afraid to displease the deputy director, and so, no one would ever escalate the matter to Director Wu. In turn, it only inflated Feng Yiqing’s arrogance.</p><p>“Director Feng?” Huo Mian knocked on the door.</p><p>“Oh hey, Mian, come in!” Feng Yiqing appeared extra welcoming when he saw Huo Mian.</p><p>“I just received notice from the Finance Department that you will be using three million yuan from the Huo Foundation to service the hospital’s back garden?” Huo Mian said as soon as she walked in, without wasting a single second.</p><p>“Yes! That’s correct. It was an emergency, so I didn’t have the chance to tell you yet. According to the regular process, I should speak to you first since you’re currently the chairman of the Huo Foundation.”</p><p>“Sorry, Director Feng, but that fund hasn’t passed through me yet. Any funding from the Huo Foundation requires signature directly from either Mr. Huo Siqian or me. Did the Finance Department not mention it to you?”</p><p>“Oh yes, they did, and it’s good that you’re here then! You can sign right here.” Feng Yiqing actually had the face to ask.</p><p>“I’m afraid there’s a misunderstanding. I’m not in agreement to approve the funding for this backyard service, so I can’t provide you with the money.”</p><p>“Why not? Wasn’t the Huo Foundation established to contribute to our hospital? It’s not like I’m using it for myself. Have you seen what the back garden looks like? It needs to be completely replaced, look at the grass, and the pavilions and bridges and how worn down they are. The industry will laugh at us if we are offering our patients such a terrible environment.”</p><p>Huo Mian waved her hand and immediately interrupted Feng Yiqing, “You’re still misunderstanding the situation. The Huo Foundation is a non-profit organization funded by Mr. Huo Siqian. It’s intended to help patients who live around here that can’t afford the down payment and is not intended to service the hospital. We’re a public hospital, and every year the government will provide funding for maintenance. So, you should be requesting funding from the deputy director, not from the Huo Foundation.”</p><p>“I know that, but my brother-in-law is out of town on a business trip right now. Who am I supposed to go to for funding then? How about this, why don’t you sign first, and we can pretend that you’re lending me the money. I will pay you back once my brother-in-law comes back.”</p><p>“Sorry, I can’t do that. These are different matters, and I don’t think servicing the back garden can be considered an emergency. It’s barely worth any mentioning compared to saving lives.”</p><p>“Mian, it’s wrong of you to say something like that. You must be new here, right? I’ve been working here for almost seven years. There’s something that you should know, by being a convenience to others, you are also bringing convenience to yourself. There’s no advantage for you to go against me.” Feng Yiqing threatened as he realized that Huo Mian had no intention of approving the funds.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":401,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:15.677","Link":"chapter-401-the-first-silent-treatment-1-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 401 - The First Silent Treatment (1)"},{"ID":181120951161354787,"Name":"Chapter 402 - The First Silent Treatment (2)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 402 - The First Silent Treatment (2)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Chapter 402</span>: The First Silent Treatment (2)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>Huo Mian chuckled slightly. “I’ve never heard of that before. But you know, whether I want to be a convenience is up to me. As the chairman of the Huo Foundation, it’s up to me how each penny is spent. How about this, why don’t you go directly to Mr. Huo Siqian and ask him yourself? If he approves the funding, then I will surely support it.”</p><p>“Now you’re just giving me a hard time. It’s not like I know Mr. Huo Siqian personally,” Feng Yiqing said. A big shot like Huo Siqian was someone even his brother-in-law had to pay the utmost respects to; he wouldn’t even have the chance to utter a sound.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then perhaps Director Feng should stop giving the Finance Department such a hard time. This is a done deal.” Huo Mian turned around and walked out after she finished speaking.</p><p>Feng Yiqing smacked his palm onto the table and muttered, “You think you’re a big shot, b*tch? You’re nothing more than a bastard child from the Huo Family. You better watch yourself or I will f**king show you what’s up.”</p><p>In the end, Feng Yiqing was unsuccessful in his attempt to use funding from the Huo Foundation. Not only that, but he was also criticized by Huo Mian, so he surely wasn’t too happy about that.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t think she made the wrong decision. It was true that the money came from Huo Siqian, but it was also her responsibility to determine what the money is being used on.</p><p>The funding was supposed to be used for a good purpose, so she was rather speechless that Feng Yiqing wanted to use the money to service South Side’s back garden.</p><p>“Head Nurse, you totally did the right thing this time. Somebody needs to show Feng Yiqing what’s up. You have no idea how bad of a person he is. Not only does he like to use public funding for himself, but he’s also always sexually harassing the nurses. It’s disgusting.”</p><p>The nurses were extremely happy that Huo Mian gave Feng Yiqing a hard time…</p><p>“I’m just sticking to the issue itself. I need to know where the money is going to make sure it is going to the right place. If not, what’s the point of this foundation? I won’t allow anyone to misuse the funds.”</p><p>Huo Mian was obstinate and hard-headed, almost a little to the extreme. Regardless of what it was, as long as she made a decision she would always stick to it. She was as stubborn as a mule.</p><p>She didn’t think much of the fact that she had offended the deputy director’s brother-in-law. After all, during the big meeting, she had also challenged the deputy director himself.</p><p>If she didn’t mind offending the deputy director, would she be bothered by offending his brother-in-law?</p><p>If she was, then she would not be Huo Mian.</p><p>Huo Mian’s phone remained silent all afternoon, and she didn’t receive a single message from Qin Chu.</p><p>She had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps Qin Chu was a little mad at her. Being the clever person that he was, he would for sure know where the roses came from.</p><p>She also lied, was that why Mr. Qin was mad at her?</p><p>She thought about it for a while and even picked up the phone, wanting to send him a message. But eventually, she ended up putting her phone down.</p><p>It’s not like she did anything. She didn’t want to tell the truth because she didn’t want to fight with him. Was she supposed to tell Qin Chu that Su Yu was courting her, and that was why he gave her roses? Wouldn’t Qin Chu be even angrier? Huo Mian thought to herself.</p><p>Huo Mian got off work at around six o’clock, and with the traffic, she got home at twenty past seven.</p><p>Qin Chu wasn’t home. Perhaps autumn was coming, but the house felt cold.</p><p>She turned on the lights and changed her shoes. She then sat down on the sofa and turned on the TV while she waited for Qin Chu to come home to have dinner with her.</p><p>There wasn’t any food in the fridge, so she was going to order a fruit pizza on her phone.</p><p>Right at this moment, Zhixin’s call came in.</p><p>“Zhixin.”</p><p>“Sis, are you off work?”</p><p>“Yup, I just got home. What’s up?”</p><p>“Sis… I have something to tell you, but please stay calm,” Zhixin spoke indecisively.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Huo Mian felt an uncomfortable feeling stir up in her stomach.</p><p>“Mom fainted, she’s at the First Hospital receiving treatment.”</p><p>“What?” Huo Mian panicked, hung up the phone, changed, and drove straight to the First Hospital.</p><p>– Outside the OR –</p><p>Huo Mian saw Jing Zhixin, whose face was filled with worry. “Zhixin, what happened to mom? Did she fall?”</p><p>“No.” Jing Zhixin shook his head.</p><p>“Then what is it?”</p><p>“It was Brother Qin Chu…”</p><p>“What’s wrong with Qin Chu?” Huo Mian felt even more nervous when she heard that whatever happened was related to Qin Chu.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":402,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:16.137","Link":"chapter-402-the-first-silent-treatment-2-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 402 - The First Silent Treatment (2)"},{"ID":181120951166153325,"Name":"Chapter 403 - The First Silent Treatment (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 403 - The First Silent Treatment (3)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 403: The First Silent Treatment (3)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>Jing Zhixin’s head hung low, and slowly he said, “Qin Chu’s mother came to our house and said something to mom. Mom got really upset so they started arguing. Mom then fell when she was pushed by Mrs. Qin’s bodyguard.”</p><p>“What?” Huo Mian’s brows knitted tightly together. The more she heard, the more her heart sank.</p><p>Qin Chu’s mother, once again…</p><p>His mother had already done this seven years ago, and she had the audacity to do it again seven years later? Did they really think Huo Mian’s family was so easily bullied?</p><p>“Zhixin, did you see it with your own eyes?” Huo Mian wanted to confirm.</p><p>“No, I wasn’t home. Auntie Wu was at our house, so she called me and told me what happened. I came to the hospital straight from school.”</p><p>Huo Mian remained silent… but her face took on a ghastly expression.</p><p>“Sis?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I think perhaps Mom found out about you and Qin Chu. That is why she was so upset.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Huo Mian was using all her effort to stay level-headed.</p><p>“So, what are you going to do now?” Jing Zhixin asked quietly, as he didn’t want to stress his sister out even more. But, on the other hand, he had no idea what he was supposed to do next. He wanted to hold on to the secret and unravel it slowly to their mother, but alas, a piece of paper was never able to cover up a flame. However, the real question is – how did Qin Chu’s mother know? Why did she have to go to their home and cause trouble?</p><p>Did Qin Chu tell his parents everything?</p><p>At the thought of this, Huo Mian felt an uncontrollable wave of rage…</p><p>“Where’s Auntie Wu?”</p><p>“Oh, she went out for water and should be back soon.”</p><p>Within a minute or so, Auntie Wu came back. She wore a flowery dress shirt with a pair of black pants and canvas flats.</p><p>“Auntie Wu.”</p><p>“Mian, you’re here.”</p><p>“Auntie Wu, what in the world happened?” Huo Mian asked immediately, as she wanted to know exactly how the incident unfolded.</p><p>Auntie Wu’s eyes glimmered, unknowing what to say…</p><p>“Auntie Wu, tell me exactly what you saw. Don’t hide anything from me, I will feel terrible. I don’t even know how my mom is doing right now, I’m really worried.”</p><p>“Mian, are you back together with that Qin family’s son again?” Auntie Wu asked profoundly and seriously.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t object, she remained silent in acceptance.</p><p>“I suppose Mrs. Qin wasn’t wrong then. She came to your house this afternoon when I was cross stitching with your mom. She was very angry and said a lot of unbearable things. She called your mom a wh*re and said she had raised a sl*t to seduce her son. It was terrible. Your mom didn’t believe her and they began arguing. You know how your mom is like, she was angry, so she went up to try and push Mrs. Qin. But, the big bodyguard behind her ran up and pushed your mom. Your mom slipped and fell, but Mrs. Qin said that your mom was intentionally pretending to be hurt, and she ended up driving away. Your mom looked like she had injured herself pretty badly, so I drove her to the hospital. She’s still in surgery, I wonder if she’s okay.”</p><p>Huo Mian’s heart felt even heavier upon hearing what Auntie Wu said…</p><p>The tragedy from seven years ago was playing itself out again. She brought misfortune onto her family again because she got back together with Qin Chu.</p><p>Tears began strolling down her face. She had no words and just wished that it was her inside the OR.</p><p>“Sis, don’t give yourself a hard time. I believe that Mom will be alright.” Jing Zhixin walked up and wiped away his sister’s tears with a tissue.</p><p>“Mian, I’m not trying to nag you, but you could’ve dated anyone! Why did you have to walk down the same path? You know very well what kind of people the Qins are. They are billionaires who can crush you like a bug! How can you be so foolish?” Auntie Wu blamed her.</p><p>Huo Mian said nothing as tears continued rolling down her cheeks…</p><p>“Auntie Wu, it is what it is, we can’t change anything. You can’t just blame my sis, it’s not like she can predict the future. She would never want Mom to end up like this. What you are saying is only making her feel worse,” Jing Zhixin interjected.</p><p>“You have a point, I won’t say much then. But, you’re old enough now. Think it through yourself.” Auntie Wu turned her head and looked at Huo Mian no more.</p><p>“Zhixin, was I wrong again?” Huo Mian looked up and asked her little brother, tears still streaming down her face.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":403,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:16.617","Link":"chapter-403-the-first-silent-treatment-3-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 403 - The First Silent Treatment (3)"},{"ID":181120951171245452,"Name":"Chapter 404 - The First Silent Treatment (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 404 - The First Silent Treatment (4)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 404: The First Silent Treatment (4)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“Sis, don’t say that.

Let’s just wait for Mom to wake up, okay?”</p><p>Huo Mian covered her face and nodded…</p><p>– Two hours later –</p><p>“Who’s the patient’s immediate family?” The OR door opened.</p><p>“I am.” Huo Mian walked over.</p><p>“The patient’s lumbar vertebrae is damaged and requires the usage of four steel nails. Did you guys want to use domestic ones or imported ones?”</p><p>“Is there a difference?” Jing Zhixin asked.</p><p>“Use imported ones, use imported for everything, even the medications.”</p><p>“Okay, you can go and pay for the operation fee first then. Pay a hundred thousand yuan first, and there may be more upcoming charges.” The doctor turned back to the OR as he finished speaking.</p><p>“A hundred thousand? Are they robbing money?” Auntie Wu complained.</p><p>She then grabbed Huo Mian by the arm and said, “Don’t let the doctor bullsh*t you. The domestic parts and imported parts are identical, they’re just trying to scam you.”</p><p>“It’s not the same, Auntie Wu. I’ve worked at the First Hospital before. Even if it’s the same medication, the results still vary depending on the manufacturer. My mom’s health is the most important thing, I can always earn more money.” Huo Mian then hurried downstairs to pay.</p><p>“It must be nice to be rich now. No wonder she didn’t like my son, she’s grabbed herself a money tree,” Auntie Wu said bitterly.</p><p>“Auntie Wu, my sis didn’t ‘grab a money tree’, she just got back together with her high school boyfriend, that’s all. They’re very much in love, and if it weren’t for my dad’s incident they would have gone abroad together. It’s not my sister’s fault.” Jing Zhixin was very protective when it came to his sister.</p><p>He wouldn’t tolerate anyone that spoke ill of his sister. He knows that his sister put a lot of effort into raising him up all these years.</p><p>She had done enough for the family and she shouldn’t have to put up with these unjustifiable accusations anymore…</p><p>Huo Mian’s phone rang as she was walking back upstairs after paying…</p><p>The call was from Qin Chu. At a sensitive moment like this, seeing Qin Chu’s name raised a deep sense of guilt within her.</p><p>Without thinking, she hung up the phone…</p><p>Qin Chu’s call came in again.</p><p>She hung up again and then proceeded to turn off her phone…</p><p>“We’re sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at the moment, please try again later.”</p><p>Qin Chu was a little surprised by the message. The call just went through a moment ago, did she turn off her phone after rejecting his call?</p><p>Was she in a meeting? Or did she run out of battery? Qin Chu wondered to himself.</p><p>The attending doctor was speaking to Jing Zhixin by the time Huo Mian got back to the OR entrance.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Sis, the doctor said Mom needs a blood transfusion, but there isn’t enough inventory. It will take too long to have them transfer over the blood bags. Good thing we’re both here, we can donate blood to Mom, it will save a lot of time.”</p><p>“We can, where should we go to donate?” Huo Mian asked.</p><p>“The clinic over there, the nurse will assist you in drawing blood.”</p><p>Huo Mian and Jing Zhixin walked over to the clinic next to them…</p><p>“Hi, we would like to draw blood for my mother’s surgery.”</p><p>“Do you know the standards for donating blood? You must have not given birth within the last year, or have anemia or any contagious diseases. You can’t donate if you have a cold. Also, you can’t donate blood if you’ve had surgery recently, or if you have cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and coronary disease. Finally, you can’t have donated blood recently.” The nurse fired out all the conditions in a row.</p><p>“I just had some medication for the common cold yesterday, is that okay?” Jing Zhixin smacked his head.</p><p>“No,” the nurse said strictly.</p><p>“Zhixin, why don’t you go wait by the entrance, I will handle it. I’m qualified.” As a health provider, she knew the standards. She sat down and waited for the nurse while Jing Zhixin walked back to the OR entrance appearing deflated.</p><p>“Do you know your blood type?” The nurse asked as she wrapped the rubber band around Huo Mian’s arm.</p><p>“Yes, I’m AB type,” Huo Mian said confidently.</p><p>“AB? The patient profile I have here shows that the patient is blood type B,” said the nurse, surprised.</p><p>Huo Mian looked slightly startled, “That’s impossible, can you double check?”</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":404,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:17.127","Link":"chapter-404-the-first-silent-treatment-4-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 404 - The First Silent Treatment (4)"},{"ID":181120951175969215,"Name":"Chapter 405 - The First Silent Treatment (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 405 - The First Silent Treatment (5)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 405: The First Silent Treatment (5)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“It can’t be wrong, it’s type B blood. We have inventory for the other blood types. We’re only lacking blood type B because there had been a large demand recently.”</p><p>Huo Mian felt her mind going blank. Not knowing what to think, she pulled back her arm.</p><p>She never paid much attention to her mother’s blood type and assumed that she was either type A or AB.</p><p>She was confident that she was type AB since she had multiple tests done in the past.</p><p>The last time she went to the hospital to visit Huo Zhenghai, she had checked his patient profile and was sure that he was blood type B.</p><p>So it had to mean that her mother was either type A or AB blood.</p><p>To have an AB type kid, if one of the parents was type B, then the other one had to be either A or AB type.</p><p>If both parents were blood type B, then the child would either have type B or O blood, meaning that having a child with AB type blood was impossible.</p><p>“Why don’t you ask another family member?” the nurse asked.</p><p>Huo Mian got up slowly, processing everything as calmly as she could. Could it be possible that her father wasn’t Huo Zhenghai?</p><p>Was Uncle Jing her real father? The answer was a definite ‘no’ as soon as the thought popped up.</p><p>Uncle Jing’s blood type was B as well, she had checked his death certificate.</p><p>So… what could it possibly mean if her blood type was AB?</p><p>Huo Mian wandered back to the entrance of the OR with her mind somewhat unhinged.</p><p>“Sis, you’re done? Did it hurt?” Jing Zhixin asked.</p><p>She knew Zhixin’s blood type was B from the last time he was in a car accident.</p><p>This means she was the only outlier within the family. If it weren’t for this blood transfusion incident, she would have always assumed her mom was blood type A or AB, just like her.</p><p>“Sis, what’s wrong?” Jing Zhixin called out several times upon seeing no response from his sister.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You’re spacing out. What’s wrong? Did you draw blood?”</p><p>“No.” Huo Mian shook her head.</p><p>She had always been as calm as a clam. However, the sudden impact of what just happened had struck her hard. She found herself unable to process the truth.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Did you not qualify as well?”</p><p>“I will drop by the OB/GYN department, I remember a couple of my coworkers have type B blood.” Huo Mian pulled her thoughts back and answered. However, she avoided answering Zhixin’s question.</p><p>Huo Mian turned on her heels after speaking…</p><p>Huang Yue and another coworker, Zhang Caiyun came over in a flash when they heard that Huo Mian’s mother needed blood.</p><p>They were both blood type B, so it solved the lack of inventory issue for Huo Mian’s mother.</p><p>“Huo Mian, our hospital sucks. They never prepare any back-up, and then the blood bank runs out during an emergency. In the end, the family member needs to donate themselves, and they don’t even give you a discount on the fees. That’s terrible.”</p><p>“If Director Wu heard what you just said, he would fire you in a heartbeat!” Zhang Caiyun chuckled.</p><p>“Of course I won’t say that when he’s here! I will definitely kiss his ass.”</p><p>Regardless of what Huang Yue and Zhang Caiyun were talking about, Huo Mian’s mind was still far away.</p><p>“Huo Mian, what’s wrong? You don’t look too well.” Huang Yue poked Huo Mian gently.</p><p>” I think I’m just too worried about my mother.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, she will be fine. Auntie has luck on her side.” Huang Yue comforted.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded…</p><p>Huang Yue intentionally walked by the entrance of the OR after she finished donating blood. She was particularly happy to see Jing Zhixin, “Don’t worry, Auntie will be alright.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Jing Zhixin nodded.</p><p>An hour later, the OR door finally opened slowly…</p><p>“Doc, is my mom okay?” Huo Mian and Jing Zhixin crowded together.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":405,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:17.597","Link":"chapter-405-the-first-silent-treatment-5-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 405 - The First Silent Treatment (5)"},{"ID":181120951181566881,"Name":"Chapter 406 - The First Silent Treatment (6)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 406 - The First Silent Treatment (6)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 406: The First Silent Treatment (6)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“The patient is no longer in critical condition. However, we just operated on her spine, so she will need to rest. We’ll have to monitor her for a while, so we’ll send her to a VIP room.”</p><p>Huo Mian’s heart ached as she stared at Yang Meirong’s pale face…</p><p>She was still unconscious from the anesthesia.</p><p>Huo Mian gave Jing Zhixin some money and asked him to take Auntie Wu out for food. She, herself, stayed behind to take care of her mother.</p><p>“Sis, what do you want to eat? Want me to bring you some take-out?”</p><p>“I don’t want anything, no appetite.” Huo Mian shook her head in exhaustion.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll come and find you in a bit.”</p><p>Jing Zhixin then took Auntie Wu, who had been helping them the entire day, out for a meal…</p><p>Huo Mian held onto Yang Meirong’s hand with a sunken heart…</p><p>If Yang Meirong wasn’t her biological mother, then who was?</p><p>Does that also mean other than Huo Zhenghai and Jing De, she’s also got a biological father?</p><p>But Yang Meirong never mentioned such things. She would have to really dig into this incident after her mother wakes up.</p><p>She had been alive for 24 years, and suddenly she was no longer who she thought she was. Her world felt shattered.</p><p>However, regardless of who Yang Meirong was, whether she was or wasn’t her real mother, she still raised her. Her heart still bled as she watched Yang Meirong lie on the hospital bed because of her.</p><p>“Mom… I pray that you will be okay and that you will get better soon.” Tears glimmered in Huo Mian’s eyes as she watched the person on the bed.</p><p>Jing Zhixin came back after thirty minutes. Auntie Wu, on the other hand, headed home after hearing that Yang Meirong’s condition was no longer critical.</p><p>“Sis, I will take over the watch, you should rest.”</p><p>“I’m fine. You should go home and sleep, you have school tomorrow.”</p><p>“My classes are okay, but you still have work. You can’t do this alone.” Jing Zhixin passed over the take-out in his hands.</p><p>“Here is some congee and pickles. Just have a little, or else your body won’t be able to take it.”</p><p>“I don’t have any appetite. Zhixin, you watch mom, I will go buy some food for my colleagues.”</p><p>After she left the VIP room, Huo Mian ordered an abundance of food from a restaurant.</p><p>Huang Yue and Zhang Caiyun donated 400CC of blood each, it was very generous for them to do so.</p><p>Like Huang Yue said, her eyes went dark and she almost fainted after donating blood…</p><p>400CC is quite a bit for a girl.</p><p>Since Huang Yue and Zhang Caiyun were close with Huo Mian, she couldn’t possibly give money to them as it would be a sign of disrespect.</p><p>So, Huo Mian purchased a lot of delicious cuisines that were high in nutritional content for her two coworkers.</p><p>During downtime, Huo Mian chatted with Head Nurse Xu Yan outside the OB/GYN clinic.</p><p>“Head Nurse, a B blood type mother and father would never be able to have an AB blood type child, right?”</p><p>“Of course not. Two B typed persons can only have a type B or O child. Weren’t you taught during your first-year intro course? That’s a silly question for a top student like you!” Xu Yan chuckled.</p><p>“Haha, it was just a thought!” Huo Mian laughed it off awkwardly.</p><p>On the other side, Qin Chu thought it was odd that Huo Mian wasn’t picking up her phone. She would very rarely turn off her phone.</p><p>There were spare chargers at home, work, and in her car, so she would be able to charge it immediately.</p><p>Unless… did something happen to her?</p><p>The more Qin Chu thought about it, the more worried he became. Finally, he made the decision to head home immediately. Today was supposed to be the day where he went to GK to delegate his duties to others. After all, he did tell his father that he was quitting. However, he got tied up by the shareholders meeting as soon as he arrived. A couple of the big shareholders were throwing tantrums, and his father was nowhere to be found. Assistant Yang was so busy that he was practically running in circles. So, Qin Chu had to come out and take care of the situation. After a full day of work, he wanted to pick up Huo Mian for dinner. However, he hadn’t been able to reach her at all, and therefore started to worry.</p><p>Huo Mian wasn’t at home either by the time he arrived. Qin Chu felt a slight panic rush over him…</p><p>He pulled out his phone and was about to try to dial her number again, he received a call from home.</p><p>‘Young Master, please come home. Mr. and Mrs. Qin had a terrible fight, Mrs. Qin is crying and threatening to leave home.”</p><p>Qin Chu furrowed his brows as the maid finished speaking. He couldn’t help but sigh, for misfortunes always come in a pair.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":406,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:18.157","Link":"chapter-406-the-first-silent-treatment-6-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 406 - The First Silent Treatment (6)"},{"ID":181120951187246499,"Name":"Chapter 407 - The First Silent Treatment (7)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 407 - The First Silent Treatment (7)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 407: The First Silent Treatment (7)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>– The Qin Manor –</p><p>All the lights in the grand, majestic mansion were lit…</p><p>As soon as Qin Chu pushed open the front door, he saw the living room in shambles; Qin Yumin sat on the couch, quietly smoking a cigarette.</p><p>His mother, on the other hand, had a piece of luggage in her hand, as if she were going somewhere…</p><p>“Mom… what are you doing?” Qin Chu frowned; he didn’t seem to approve his parents’ actions.</p><p>Over the years, his mother had always been somewhat high maintenance and ill-tempered, but she knew when to compromise. His father was the one who made the big decisions in their family.</p><p>Usually, his mother made smaller, day-to-day decisions, like which brand of soy sauce to buy. Qin Chu didn’t know what kind of problem would cause them to fight as seriously as they were.</p><p>“Son, you came back at the perfect time. I don’t want to live with your dad anymore, I want a divorce.”</p><p>As soon as Mrs. Qin saw her son come back, she immediately began playing the role of the poor, sad lady – there were tears in her eyes as if she had been badly wronged.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Your dad said that he approved your resignation, but I’m not going to agree to it. How can you guys not discuss something as big as this with me? Do the two of you not treat me as a part of the family?”</p><p>“Mom, it’s company business,” Qin Chu objected.</p><p>“Company business? Isn’t GK the family’s company? Anyways… I told him that you’re our only son, and you can’t leave GK or us. We already tolerated your decision to move out, but how can you have the heart to… completely leave us? I bet your father is cooking something up behind me. Maybe he has a mistress and an illegitimate child somewhere, that’s why he’s treating you and me with such indifference.”</p><p>“Don’t you cast malicious slanders at me…” Qin Yumin pointed at his wife with trembling fingers.</p><p>Him agreeing to Qin Chu’s resignation was a heat-of-the-moment thing; of course, he wasn’t going to actually cut ties with his son.</p><p>“Mom… my dad’s not like that. You’ve been married for so long, you should know him better than I do. Don’t say hurtful things like you’re giving out candy; you may not mean it, but he might be hurt by what you say.”</p><p>Qin Chu always thought that his mother had a poisonous tongue – if she was in the right, she would rub it in others’ faces; if she was in the wrong, she would still argue as much as she could.</p><p>All these years, his father had treated his mother quite well and never quibbled with her over the small details.</p><p>Now that they were older, his father wanted to protect his reputation. He couldn’t stand someone accusing him of having a mistress and illegitimate child.</p><p>“Who knows? Everyone knows that he’s calculating and shrewd, but I’m not about to be tricked by him.” Mrs. Qin was holding her stance.</p><p>“If you want to go, just go, I won’t stop you. I’ve had enough of you over these years.” Qin Yumin waved his hand in fury.</p><p>“Great, son, listen to him, he finally said the truth. You can tell he wants to chase me out of the house. I’ve lived here for so long, he doesn’t have to award me, but I did so much work around here. I also gave birth to Chu; Qin Yumin, I can’t believe you have the audacity to treat me like this, do you really have the guts…”</p><p>Mrs. Qin didn’t seem to be in a hurry to head out the door; she pointed at Qin Yumin as she shrieked at him, much like a shrewd b*tch.</p><p>“Mom… stop it, you guys.”</p><p>“Chu, look at your dad…” Mrs. Qin continued.</p><p>“Mom, stop putting on a show. I know you guys better than you know yourselves, so stop acting in front of me, there are just too many flaws. Oh, and… you guys are doing this so that I don’t leave the company, right? Fine, I didn’t say that I had to resign. However, if I don’t, then Dad, you cannot interfere with any of my decisions in the future. You don’t have to go through all that trouble to play pity in front of me, your son isn’t that stupid,” Qin Chu leaned by the door, looking helplessly at his parents and telling them what he thought.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":407,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:18.723","Link":"chapter-407-the-first-silent-treatment-7-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 407 - The First Silent Treatment (7)"},{"ID":181120951193763609,"Name":"Chapter 408 - The First Silent Treatment (8)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 408 - The First Silent Treatment (8)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 408: The First Silent Treatment (8)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>Qin Chu was helpless in front of his mother’s act; it might have seemed real, but… he immediately caught onto the flaws in their fight.</p><p>His parents’ expressions turned awkward after their act was exposed…</p><p>Qin Yumin looked down and coughed, not sure what he was thinking about.</p><p>Mrs. Qin reached out to grab her son’s arm and nagged, “Don’t worry, your father will never interfere with anything you do in the future, you can do whatever you want, even if you take the company down, it’s okay, I have enough money in our Swiss Bank’s account for us to live the rest of our lives with. Just… don’t date Huo Mian anymore.”</p><p>“Didn’t dad tell you?”</p><p>“Tell me what?” Mrs. Qin froze for a second.</p><p>“Huo Mian and I… are already married. We got our marriage certificate a while ago.”</p><p>“WHAT?” Mrs. Qin shrieked.</p><p>Qin Yumin hadn’t yet told this news to his wife; he only beat around the bushes by telling her that their son was still dating Huo Mian.</p><p>Even then, Mrs. Qin, furious, ran over to create chaos at Huo Mian’s mother’s home…</p><p>If she found out that they were married, things would not have been as ‘peaceful’.</p><p>“We got married a little over 4 months ago. After I moved out, I moved in with her,” Qin Chu said peacefully.</p><p>Mrs. Qin’s expression changed drastically…</p><p>“No wonder you don’t seem to be interested in anyone else, it’s because you married that little vixen b*tch.”</p><p>“Mom, use your words wisely. Mian isn’t a vixen b*tch. Legally, she’s your daughter-in-law.”</p><p>“Yeah right, I will never recognize her as my daughter-in-law. Oh, and her vixen b*tch mother, it looks like I didn’t yell at her enough today. I should’ve ripped their house apart and forced them onto the street when I had the chance. They’re both calculating b*tches, both of them!” Mrs. Qin cursed aloud, completely forgetting that she was someone of high social status.</p><p>“What did you say?” Qin Chu frowned at what his mother said.</p><p>“I went to their little crappy house today and saw her mom… that foolish woman didn’t know what she was going against and tried to scratch me. Thank god I brought bodyguards with me, and that stupid b*tch pretended that she was hurt and fell to the ground. Seriously, I almost laughed out loud. I knew that poor b*tches like them only want money. Actually, I can give them money, as much as they want. Why order their daughter to seduce my son and pull dirty tricks like this? I knew that damned girl was a seducing b*tch, even all those years ago. I was right, they’re…”</p><p>Mrs. Qin didn’t get to finish her sentence before Qin Chu turned around to leave…</p><p>“Hey, son, where are you going?” Mrs. Qin shouted behind him, but Qin Chu didn’t look back.</p><p>He finally understood why Huo Mian refused to pick up her phone…</p><p>“Say something to your son too! Do you think he went looking for that b*tch again?” Mrs. Qin looked at Qin Yumin furiously.</p><p>“I think you went overboard this time, you shouldn’t have gone to her house to pick a bone with her. If something really happens to her mother, money won’t be able to solve it. Don’t forget, they’re married, you and that girl’s mother are technically in-laws…”</p><p>“Pfft, there’s no way I would recognize that poor and lowly woman as my in-law, we’re going to be laughed at if others find out! That woman was no good when she was young, she used her face and figure to sing a few songs and star in a few TV shows, and then she seduced that good-for-nothing Huo Zhenghai. Look at what came out of it! She got played and kicked out like a plague! She got pregnant, and he refused to give her child support. He won’t even recognize that girl as his daughter! I bet she was laughed at by all her neighbors. If I were her, I would’ve been too ashamed to live and throw myself in front of a car.”</p><p>“You need to be more careful with your choice of words…” Qin Yumin looked helplessly at his wife.</p><p>It was useless; Mrs. Qin wasn’t born rich, but still, her parents were high-level officials.</p><p>Qin Chu’s maternal grandparents were officials at the Ministry of Finance, and they lived a comfortable life. Five years ago, Qin Chu’s grandfather died, and his grandmother immigrated to New Zealand with his uncle. Mrs. Qin was someone who was born arrogant and always looked down on poor women with bad reputations.</p><p>She looked at people like that with extreme bias, and that was why she was so rude to Yang Meirong…</p><p>Qin Chu drove his car all the way to Huo Mian’s home. He knocked and knocked, but no one answered the door. He tried calling, but Huo Mian’s phone was powered off.</p><p>“Who are you looking for?” Auntie Wu had just finished eating lunch when she saw someone standing outside Yang Meirong’s house.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":408,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:19.38","Link":"chapter-408-the-first-silent-treatment-8-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 408 - The First Silent Treatment (8)"},{"ID":18112095119839196,"Name":"Chapter 409 - The First Silent Treatment (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 409 - The First Silent Treatment (9)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 409: The First Silent Treatment (9)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“I’m looking for Huo Mian.”</p><p>“She’s not at home.”</p><p>“What about other members of her family?” Qin Chu asked.</p><p>“None of them are at home. You must be Mian’s boyfriend.” Auntie Wu sounded unfriendly.</p><p>“Yeah.” Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>“It’s good that you’re here. I suggest that you have a talk with your mom and tell her not to come here creating a scene again. Let’s put reputation aside, Meirong has worked really hard to bring up two children. Her health isn’t that good, and she has high blood pressure. She usually tries to maintain her health, but then today, your mom showed up like that with her bodyguards, and pushed her to the ground, hospitalizing her. Then, your mom strode away with her bodyguards without even giving her money to go to the hospital. She sure is heartless, you all are. I really don’t know what Mian sees in you, she’s a good girl, it’s such a shame.”</p><p>Auntie Wu didn’t know what Qin Chu did for a living, but from the way he acted, the clothes he wore and the expensive car he drove, she knew that he was rich.</p><p>Therefore, Auntie Wu pointed at Qin Chu and gave him a good talking to…</p><p>“Could you please tell me where they are right now?”</p><p>“She’s at the hospital, Mian and Zhixin are with her. It’s serious, the operation lasted a couple of hours, and the doctor said something about putting bolts in her to stabilize her condition. I saw the bodyguard that your mom brought with her, he pushed Meirong really hard. Sue them if you want to, but I will testify for Meirong. Your mom looks like a nice, elegant, and sophisticated lady from the outside, but the truth is, she is a really bad and vicious person. Oh, and… if your parents don’t approve of her, then why chase after Mian? You’ve… angered everyone.”</p><p>Auntie Wu droned on, but Qin Chu politely nodded his head and said, “Thank you.”</p><p>Then, he drove as fast as he could to the hospital. Aside from the First Hospital, he didn’t know where else to go…</p><p>As soon as he arrived, he found their information in the VIP area.</p><p>When Qin Chu went in, Huo Mian was sitting on a bench, her hands supporting her head. He didn’t know what she was thinking about.</p><p>“Mian…” He quietly called her name.</p><p>Huo Mian slowly looked up; when she looked at him, her expression was icy cold, without a speck of gentleness.</p><p>“Why didn’t you pick up?” Qin Chu walked over to ask her.</p><p>“I didn’t want to.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me that something this big happened?”</p><p>“So what if I did? Would you have pushed your mom for me to make it even?” Huo Mian demanded coldly.</p><p>Qin Chu fell silent…</p><p>He had seen Huo Mian as cold and determined like this before. It was seven years ago when she broke up with him.</p><p>She was willing to say anything that would hurt him.</p><p>Qin Chu raised his hands and placed them on Huo Mian’s shoulders, “Mian, don’t be like that… I didn’t want things to be this way.”</p><p>“Didn’t everything happen because of you? If you hadn’t told your parents, they wouldn’t have created a scene at my house. I told you to keep our marriage a secret, but it was all bullshit to you, wasn’t it?” Huo Mian was agitated.</p><p>“No, it wasn’t, I didn’t think they would act so rashly… I just wanted to let the whole world know that we’re together, I don’t want to be in a secret marriage for the rest of my life.”</p><p>“What was wrong with living a secret life? I’m not scared, so what are you, a grown man, scared of? Isn’t us staying a secret better than what’s happening right now? Do you know what idiotic thing your mom did? She brought bodyguards over to my house to bully my mom. She was forced to get surgery and had to get bolts put into her body! She’s still not awake! What about your mom? I bet she’s enjoying her afternoon tea at home, isn’t she?”</p><p>“Mian… let me deal with this.”</p><p>“Deal with this? How? I’m intrigued.”</p><p>“Once your mother wakes up, I will personally apologize to her. I will take responsibility for everything, whether she wants to kill me or cut me up into pieces.” Qin Chu thought that everything happened because of him, so… he was willing to take full responsibility.</p><p>“You’re hilarious, you didn’t do anything wrong, why should you have to take responsibility?”</p><p>Huo Mian’s mouth lifted into an icy smile…</p><p>Qin Chu was scared of how distant Huo Mian seemed to be…</p><p>“Mian, listen to me, I think…” Qin Chu grabbed Huo Mian’s arm and tried to patiently explain the situation to her.</p><p>However, Huo Mian struggled away from Qin Chu’s embrace, looked into his eyes, and said, “Qin Chu, let’s get a divorce.”</p><p>“What… did you say?” Qin Chu’s body went into shock.</p><p>Noodletown_ Noodletown_ Don’t worry guys, the fight’s not gonna last long looool</p><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":409,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:19.84","Link":"chapter-409-the-first-silent-treatment-9-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 409 - The First Silent Treatment (9)"},{"ID":181120951203817863,"Name":"Chapter 410 - The First Silent Treatment (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 410 - The First Silent Treatment (10)","Description":"<p></p><p>Chapter 410: The First Silent Treatment (10)</p><p>Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated</p><p>“I said, I want a divorce.”</p><p>“No, don’t even think about it.” Qin Chu immediately declined. From the moment he married her, he never thought about divorcing her.</p><p>“I wasn’t asking for your opinion, and I don’t care if you agree or not. I’m going to move out first, and in 6 months, I will ask the court for a divorce. That’s all.”</p><p>Then, Huo Mian got up to head into the patient’s room…</p><p>“Honey…” Qin Chu’s heart throbbed as he attempted to grab onto Huo Mian’s arm.</p><p>“Let go of me.” Huo Mian’s tone was cold and distant; she seemed like a completely different person.</p><p>“Don’t follow me. My mom is not awake yet, and I’m sure she won’t want to see your face.” Then, Huo Mian turned around to go into the room.</p><p>Qin Chu stood outside alone, feeling the slight throbbing at the bottom of his heart…</p><p>This was something that he was most afraid of facing, but it still happened…</p><p>Seven years ago, Huo Mian went back on their deal to go to the States with him when her uncle died.</p><p>She ended up breaking up with him…</p><p>He went to the U.S. alone and didn’t come back for 7 years, not even for his grandfather’s funeral.</p><p>He never would’ve thought that tragedy would repeat itself…</p><p>His arrogant and rude mother was the source of everything bad that had happened…</p><p>Qin Chu left the hospital with a heavy heart. He put down 500,000 yuan in deposit for Huo Mian’s mother’s hospitalization before driving away from the hospital…</p><p>“Where are you?”</p><p>“At the bureau.”</p><p>“Come out for a drink.”</p><p>“Right now?” Gao Ran was confused.</p><p>“Yes, right now.”</p><p>“Okay, let me finish up with this grand larceny case I’m on, and I’ll be there soon, okay? Wait for me.”</p><p>Then, Gao Ran quickly hung up the phone…</p><p>That night, her mother hadn’t yet awoken, so Huo Mian asked the doctor how she was doing.</p><p>Apparently, because her body was weak, it’ll take a while before she wakes up, but her stats had all stabilized.</p><p>When Huo Mian came back, she was afraid of going into the room because she felt guilty towards her mother.</p><p>She stood by the corner of the corridor, with a cigarette in her hand…</p><p>It was a Russian cigarette – brown and thin, but strong.</p><p>Huo Mian wasn’t addicted, but she liked the smell of cigarettes. Call it a hobby if you will.</p><p>Therefore, she always kept a pack in her purse; when she was stressed out or tired, she would take it out and take a sniff.</p><p>She never lit it up…</p><p>But today was different; she found a lighter, lit up the cigarette, and held it between her index and middle fingers.</p><p>Then, she sucked in with all her might…</p><p>She didn’t know how to smoke, so her lungs reacted immediately, and she began coughing like crazy…</p><p>“Sis… are you smoking?” Jing Zhixin had been looking everywhere for his sister before finally seeing her at the end of the corridor.</p><p>Seeing a cigarette in his sister’s hand, he immediately grabbed it, threw it onto the ground, and repeatedly stomped on it.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t make a sound; she seemed to be in a trance…</p><p>“Sis… if you want to cry, just cry, I know how bad you must be feeling.” Jing Zhixin looked at his sister sympathetically.</p><p>Even he wanted to cry – he knew the dilemma his sister must be in. She loved her mother and loved Qin Chu.</p><p>However, she had to choose between love and family. It was impossible, but his sister was forced to make that decision once already, seven years ago.</p><p>Seven years later, she had to make the same decision. Normal people would not be able to withstand something like that…</p><p>“I’m fine, I’m okay,” Huo Mian replied with a hoarse voice.</p><p>“Sis, don’t blame yourself. Mom is fine, and her life isn’t in danger…” Jing Zhixin consoled.</p><p>Huo Mian combed through her hair with her fingers and smoothed it out. Then, she smiled depressingly, “Zhixin… do you think that your sister is a good-for-nothing?”</p><p>“Why would you say that?” Jing Zhixin didn’t know what his sister was talking about.</p><p>Huo Mian patted Jing Zhixin’s shoulder, “Stay with mom, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Then, she quickly went downstairs; Jing Zhixin was worried as he saw his sister leave…</p><ul><li>Qin Manor –</li></ul><p>“Who are you looking for?” The housekeeper opened the door to see an unfamiliar face.</p><p>“I’m looking for Mrs. Qin.” Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>“Mrs. Qin, someone’s looking for you.”</p><p>“Coming.” Mrs. Qin had wreaked havoc the entire evening; just as she was about to take a shower and put on a beauty face mask, she heard someone looking for her. She came out in her bathrobe, and her expression changed dramatically at the sight of Huo Mian.</p><p>“Long time no see…” Huo Mian beamed brightly at Mrs. Qin.</p><p>Noodletown_ Noodletown_ Don’t worry, the fight between Qin Chu and Huo Mian won’t even last a day… have some faith in them lool.

Therefore, although they hadn’t seen each other in years, she would never forget Huo Mian’s face.</p><p>Ignoring Mrs. Qin’s question completely, Huo Mian walked straight in and sat down on their leather couch.</p><p>Then, she slowly leaned back…</p><p>“I’m curious, I made the decision to be with Qin Chu, why do you keep looking for my mom? Just because she’s poor and her= status isn’t as high as yours, she’s supposed to be bullied?” Huo Mian’s voice was icy.</p><p>“It’s a father’s fault for not teaching his child right. But since you didn’t have a father growing up, of course I was supposed to pick my bone with your mom. Who else should I look for? You? Do you really think that you’re a good girl, doing disgraceful and shameful things like this?”</p><p>Mrs. Qin became agitated as soon as Huo Mian brought up this subject, so she threw rude remarks at Huo Mian…</p><p>Huo Mian smiled coldly, “What disgraceful thing did I do?”</p><p>“You’re disgraceful for seducing my son, how can a girl as young as you know how to seduce someone like that? You and your mom are two peas in a pod.”</p><p>“But isn’t seducing a man a kind of talent? If you hadn’t seduced Qin Chu’s father, would he really have married you?”</p><p>Mrs. Qin’s expression changed as she pointed at Huo Mian and cursed, “You little b*tch, what do you think you’re talking about? Do you think that established families like mine with a great reputation would be the same as a lowlife like you?”</p><p>“Who knows, you may seem all high and mighty, but the things that you do are mean and shameless. At least lowlifes like me don’t do things behind others’ backs. I categorize people like you as ‘those who look fine from the outside but are actually rotten on the inside’.” Huo Mian stared at Mrs. Qin as she enunciated each word.</p><p>“Stop this nonsense, I’m telling you, I don’t care if you and my son are married, the Qin Family will never recognize you, stop fantasizing!”</p><p>Huo Mian shook her head, “No, you’re wrong. The truth is, I don’t care if the Qin family recognizes me, that’s not important to me. I only care whether Qin Chu and the law recognizes me. Just to let you know, we didn’t even get a prenup. If I sue for divorce right now, I’d probably get half of the GK empire… Tsk tsk… That’s a good idea.”</p><p>Mrs. Qin’s face turned pale white upon hearing Huo Mian’s remarks…</p><p>She knew that her stupid son would never get a prenup before he married her.</p><p>That means that if they got divorced, Qin Chu would have to give her a sky-high alimony, or even half of everything he had.</p><p>“See? I knew it, you don’t even love Chu, you are with him for our money. You’ve finally revealed yourself, haven’t you?” Mrs. Qin scolded Huo Mian’s love for money and was so furious her face almost turned purple.</p><p>Huo Mian answered slowly, “It’s none of your business whether I love Qin Chu or not, I don’t have to prove it to anyone. It’s also none of your business if I love money or not, I don’t have to explain anything to you. You seem to despise me, don’t you?”</p><p>“I hate you… You’re the most hateful woman on this earth.” Mrs. Qin stared at Huo Mian with disgust, not concealing her true thoughts at all.</p><p>“Therefore… your hatred towards me gave me a better idea.” Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>“What idea? Don’t you just want to divorce my son and take his money? We have our own legal team, you won’t get what you wish.” A bad feeling crept up Mrs. Qin’s spine when she saw Huo Mian smiling; she knew that she wasn’t as simple as that.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":411,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:20.873","Link":"chapter-411-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-1-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 411 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (1)"},{"ID":181120951213446576,"Name":"Chapter 412 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (2)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 412 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (2)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 412: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (2)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“No, I originally did want to do that, but I suddenly changed my mind. If you hate me so much, then I’m not going to get divorced. Not only that, I’m going to live with Qin Chu for the rest of my life, right under your eyeballs. You won’t be able to get rid of me and can live the rest of your life in agony. I think that’s the best outcome for someone like you.”</p><p>“What did you say?” Mrs. Qin’s pupils dilated in disbelief after hearing what Huo Mian said.</p><p>She was shocked that a seemingly weak and feeble girl like Huo Mian would say something so vicious…</p><p>To Mrs. Qin, Huo Mian was a horrifically vicious woman…</p><p>They had crossed paths a couple of times seven years ago, but Huo Mian never said anything to this extent.</p><p>Even when her stepfather died, she never really blamed or cursed at Qin Chu’s mother.</p><p>After all, back then, she felt like she was the one responsible, so she was extremely guilty and blamed herself for everything.</p><p>However, things were different now. Huo Mian felt like Mrs. Qin had crossed the line…</p><p>Mrs. Qin wasn’t happy, so she used her mother as a punching bag, causing her mother to be hospitalized and have to undergo surgery.</p><p>This time, Huo Mian wasn’t going to back down, mentally or verbally… she was going to talk to her as she saw fit.</p><p>Mrs. Qin was furious; she wanted to rip Huo Mian into little pieces…</p><p>“I’m shocked at how evil you are, and at such a young age! How could my son fall so hard for someone like you?” Mrs. Qin shivered; she got goosebumps upon hearing what Huo Mian just said.</p><p>If things went Huo Mian’s way and she really had to see her for the rest of her life, then she would really rather die.</p><p>“I’m evil? No, I’m nothing compared to you. You brought bodyguards to arrogantly bully my widowed mother. Now, that’s evil. Are you trying to suppress people with your power and wealth? That’s fine because I believe in karma. I will avenge what you did to my mother little by little, please… enjoy.”</p><p>Then, Huo Mian got up to leave…</p><p>“Stop right there, I’m not done yet…” Mrs. Qin was so furious that she reached out to grab Huo Mian’s arm.</p><p>Huo Mian quickly avoided her, causing Mrs. Qin to slip and fall. Her arms and legs fumbled at the same time, and she crashed onto the ground.</p><p>“Ah! Someone quickly, call the police, this woman is beating me up!” Mrs. Qin immediately lied on the floor and wailed.</p><p>Huo Mian stopped in her tracks and looked back at her, her expression as icy as ever.</p><p>“Are you sure you want to call the cops? If you’re not afraid of tainting the reputation of your company, your husband, and your son, be my guest. Either way, I don’t care. If you lock me up in detention, Qin Chu will not only bail me out at once, he’ll also blame you…” Huo Mian smiled.</p><p>“You…” A surge of fury bubbled in Mrs. Qin’s throat, but she couldn’t let it out.</p><p>“Mrs. Qin, what should we do? Should we call the cops?” The housekeeper saw Mrs. Qin lying on the ground and wasn’t sure what to do.</p><p>Mrs. Qin wasn’t stupid; she thought about what Huo Mian said and thought that she had a great point.</p><p>After weighing the advantages against the disadvantages, she decided not to call the cops. After all, doing so would put Qin Chu in a pickle.</p><p>“You win this time, just you wait,” Mrs. Qin spat at her.</p><p>“I’ll be waiting.” Huo Mian sneered; then, she turned around to leave the Qin manor.</p><p>As soon as Huo Mian left, Mrs. Qin told the housekeeper to call Qin Chu.</p><p>Qin Chu was drinking with Gao Ran and picked up his phone in a daze.</p><p>“Young master, something happened. A woman came to the house just now and got into a fight with Mrs. Qin and pushed her onto the floor. Mrs. Qin is agitated, and that woman… I think she’s your girlfriend or something, you should come back quickly!”</p><p>“Where’s my mom?” Qin Chu wasn’t surprised, because he knew his mother’s temper too well.</p><p>“She’s resting in the bedroom.”</p><p>“Put her on,” Qin Chu ordered.</p><p>“Son… you didn’t know, but Huo Mian just came to our house to provoke me. She cursed at me and pushed me to the ground. She’s evil, you can’t stay married to her anymore, do you hear me?”</p><p>“Mian went to our house?” Qin Chu’s expression turned soft at the mention of Huo Mian’s name.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":412,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:21.347","Link":"chapter-412-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-2-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 412 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (2)"},{"ID":181120951218502290,"Name":"Chapter 413 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 413 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (3)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 413: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (3)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“She really came, I’m not lying to you, that woman is unbelievable…” Mrs. Qin droned on and on.</p><p>Qin Chu was silent for a while and then quietly said, “Mom, I love her very much.”</p><p>“Why are you such a good-for-nothing, do you know what she said to me? She said that she got married to you because she wanted to divorce you and inherit your money!”</p><p>“I’d rather it be that way. I have a lot of money. If she loves me, I can give her as much money as she wants. As long as she doesn’t leave me,” Qin Chu replied slowly.</p><p>“That woman also said that she didn’t want to get divorced anymore, she wants to piss me off until I’m dead, and stand up against me for the rest of my life. Look at how evil she is, she’s too young to be this evil! What did the Qin family do to deserve this? Son, why would you fall for a woman like that? There are so many women in the world, and you had to pick her? Are you trying to kill me?” Mrs. Qin wanted to tattle to his son about how rude and evil Huo Mian was, but to her disappointment, her son remained unmoved.</p><p>“She said… that she didn’t want a divorce anymore?” A pleasant surprise flashed before Qin Chu’s eyes, and his tone changed slightly.</p><p>“Yeah, she wants to piss me off until I drop dead. This woman isn’t well educated by her parents, her character is awful. Son… listen to mom, don’t stay with her. You guys need to get divorced. We have a legal team, let’s frame her for cheating on you or something, and make her leave without a cent of our money…” Mrs. Qin rambled on nonstop.</p><p>However, Qin Chu didn’t listen to any of that; he only had one phrase in his mind, and that was ‘Huo Mian said she didn’t want to get divorced anymore’…</p><p>No matter what she meant by that, Qin Chu felt better, as long as she didn’t want to divorce him anymore.</p><p>“Mom… Huo Mian will be your only daughter-in-law in this life, please be kind to her.” Then, Qin Chu hung up the phone.</p><p>“What? You want me to be kind to her… are you trying to kill me as well? Hello? Hello?” Mrs. Qin shrieked uncontrollably.</p><p>However, Qin Chu had already hung up the phone…</p><p>When she called back, his phone went straight to voicemail…</p><p>Furious, Mrs. Qin complained to the housekeeper all night.</p><p>That night, when Qin Yumin came back, she recreated the scene to him.</p><p>Upon hearing what happened, Qin Yumin said earnestly, “Things wouldn’t have gotten this bad if you hadn’t gone to their house to cause a scene. I hear that her mother was pretty seriously injured, and I think you overdid it this time. It’s not weird for Huo Mian to treat you like that.” (TL Note: Noodletown’s spoiler page updated to unveil this clue left by the author)</p><p>“What are you talking about? Why are you taking her side?”</p><p>“I’m not taking sides, I’m just speaking the truth.” Qin Yumin sighed.</p><p>“Speaking the truth? The truth is that little b*tch came to declare war at my house and said that she was going to live under my eyeballs for the rest of my life. Seriously, she’s shameless,” Mrs. Qin shrieked.</p><p>“Calm down…”</p><p>“No, I can’t believe that she would challenge me like that. I’m not scared of her, I will make her regret that she ever crossed me.” Mrs. Qin had a hot temper – as soon as she was provoked, she would immediately erupt. Therefore, she was determined to fight Huo Mian to the death, rather than think back at what she might have done wrong…</p><p>That night, after Huo Mian left the Qin Manor, she didn’t go back to the hospital. Rather, she walked alone on the streets in her beige wind coat.</p><p>The autumn night felt nice, and cool breezes blew past her now and then. At that moment, she didn’t know where she was supposed to go.</p><p>She didn’t want to go back to Imperial Park, and no one was at her mother’s home because both her mother and Zhixin were at the hospital.</p><p>“Sis, where are you?” Zhixin called.</p><p>“Outside.”</p><p>“Sis, our mom is awake, you should come back,” Jing Zhixin said anxiously.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":413,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:21.85","Link":"chapter-413-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-3-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 413 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (3)"},{"ID":181120951223836369,"Name":"Chapter 414 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 414 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (4)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 414: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (4)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“Okay, take care of her for now.” Huo Mian sighed slightly after she hung up the phone.</p><p>She was scared and didn’t know how to face her mother. She wasn’t worried about being blamed or cursed at, but she was terrified of her mother’s silent treatment.</p><p>It scared her more than any words could…</p><p>By accident, Huo Mian arrived outside the Seductive Fox Nightclub. Last time she came here was to pick Zhu Lingling up.</p><p>In the end, a battle erupted… and she was sued.</p><p>This time, she came here because she didn’t know where else to go. Therefore, as if she were in a trance, Huo Mian walked in.</p><p>The first floor was the bar; it was a 500-square-meter area, with eardrum-blowing music blasting from the speakers.</p><p>“Hi Miss, what would you like to drink?” a waiter asked politely.</p><p>“A dozen bottles of Budweiser, thank you.” Huo Mian opened her mouth faintly. (TL Note: Budweiser you can mail me the cheque)</p><p>“Okay, please wait.”</p><p>Soon, the waiter came back with the beer…</p><p>“Would you like me to open them?”</p><p>“Open them all.” Huo Mian nodded.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>The waiter opened the 12 bottles of beer for Huo Mian…</p><p>She sat by a wooden table in the southeast corner of the bar.</p><p>Not far from her, in the middle of the dancefloor, was a group of Russian beauties pole dancing.</p><p>Countless men and women moved to the beat around them…</p><p>Huo Mian stared at the bustling scene and felt even more depressed…</p><p>She suddenly remembered a song by Ah-Sun. The name of the song was ‘Leaves’.</p><p>There were two sentences in the song that really spoke to her –”being lonely is a one-person party; partying is just a group of people being lonely.”</p><p>Perhaps all the people here were lonely, and that’s why they were all here, drinking their troubles away.</p><p>Huo Mian was enjoying her beer when she suddenly heard a man’s voice from behind.</p><p>“Hey, pretty lady, are you here alone?”</p><p>Huo Mian turned around to see a middle-aged man in a white shirt and black suit pants. He looked well-learned and refined, with a smile on his face.</p><p>Huo Mian glanced at him but didn’t say anything. Then, she turned around and kept drinking.</p><p>“Are you upset about something? You’ve ordered so much to drink.” The man didn’t want to give up; he scooted up to Huo Mian and sat down across from her.</p><p>Huo Mian was still silent…</p><p>The man raised a hand and snapped his fingers.</p><p>A waiter immediately walked up, “Sir, what would you like?”</p><p>“A bottle of Jack Daniels, two fruit platters, and some dessert.” (TL Note: Jack Daniels, you can send me a cheque too)</p><p>“Okay, sir, please wait.”</p><p>After the waiter left, the man looked at Huo Mian with interest, “I love proud and mighty-looking pretty girls like you.”</p><p>Huo Mian glanced at him in disgust, “And I hate well-dressed nightclub studhorse animals like you.”</p><p>“A well-dressed animal? Me?” The man was a little surprised.</p><p>“I’m obviously not talking about myself,” Huo Mian replied coldly.</p><p>“Haha, that’s a good word, it describes me perfectly.” The man smiled; he didn’t seem to care.</p><p>“Sir, your drink.”</p><p>Soon, the waiter slowly brought them the liquor, fruit platters, and small plates of desserts.</p><p>“Pretty lady, let me buy you a drink.” The man opened the bottle of Jack Daniels and poured some into two glasses, both with ice and black tea.</p><p>He then handed a glass to Huo Mian…</p><p>“I only drink Budweiser.” Huo Mian didn’t even bother looking at him.</p><p>The man looked at Huo Mian’s profile closely; under the nightclub lights, this woman was beautiful.</p><p>The women at these nightclubs all wore revealing and sexy clothes. Therefore, his expression lit up when he saw Huo Mian, in a beige wind coat, jeans, low-heel shoes, and her hair up in a bun. Her outfit was casual yet graceful.</p><p>“Let’s get to know each other, this is my business card.” The man took out a golden business card from his pocket and pushed it over to Huo Mian. Huo Mian glanced at it and laughed.</p><p>“You work at GK?” Huo Mian finally seemed to be smiling as she looked at him.</p><p>“Yes, hi, allow me to introduce myself. I am the deputy manager of GK’s IT department, Wang Tao. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Oh, hi, Mr. Wang, I am the wife of GK’s President Qin Chu, my name is Huo Mian.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression changed immediately upon hearing this. Then, he laughed, “Pretty girl, quit joking around.”</p><p>“I’m serious. Why don’t you go and ask your president?” Huo Mian raised the beer bottle in her hand and smiled mysteriously.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":414,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:22.383","Link":"chapter-414-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-4-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 414 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (4)"},{"ID":181120951228962083,"Name":"Chapter 415 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 415 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (5)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 415: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (5)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“Haha… you must be kidding me. Our president returned to the country less than 6 months ago.”</p><p>“We got married less than 6 months ago,” Huo Mian replied.</p><p>“But… I never got news that our president got married. Apparently, he doesn’t even have a girlfriend.” Wang Tao seriously thought back at everything he heard about President Qin.</p><p>“An employee your level probably doesn’t have the clearance to know something like this.”</p><p>“Haha… I still don’t believe you, your joke is a little too much.”</p><p>Wang Tao was positive that this woman was bluffing…</p><p>Although she was wearing luxury-brand casual clothes, that didn’t mean that she was the president’s wife.</p><p>Huo Mian put down the beer bottle in her hand and said slowly, “So, do you want to make a bet with me?”</p><p>“What bet?” Wang Tao froze for a second.</p><p>“I can call Qin Chu right now and ask him to fire you immediately. If you are notified by the company when you get there tomorrow, that means I’m telling the truth. If nothing happens, then I’m lying. But you should consider this bet carefully, since you’ll be putting your career on the line. After all, you must’ve worked hard to become the deputy manager at a company like that. Let me see, looking at your current position, plus year-end bonuses, you must earn about 800,000 yuan a year. That’s not bad.”</p><p>Wang Tao became nervous at what she said…</p><p>“What if you were lying and lost the bet?”</p><p>“If I’m lying, I’ll kneel down in front of GK tomorrow morning and call you my daddy, what do you think?”</p><p>“No thanks.” He wasn’t an idiot; plus, he saw how confident Huo Mian was.</p><p>He wasn’t convinced, but he was also not willing to bet his entire career on this. After all, he worked hard and long to get to where he was now.</p><p>He was already 37 years old and finally successful. He would cry his eyes out if he lost everything because of a stupid bet.</p><p>Therefore, in the end, Wang Tao wasn’t brave enough to make the bet with Huo Mian…</p><p>“Pretty girl, since we met each other here, why don’t we have a drink and get to know each other…” Wang Tao thought about it; if that woman was really his boss’ wife, he should suck up to her right? If she ended up saying nice things about him to the president, he might be able to receive another promotion.</p><p>“Is it okay for you to harass your boss’s wife like this? Aren’t you afraid that the president will fire you? Be a smart guy and leave before I lose my patience. Or else… you’ll regret it.”</p><p>Huo Mian hated being hit on at a bar… She was here because she wasn’t in a good mood and wanted to drink.</p><p>Therefore, she issued an unfriendly warning to the man in front of him…</p><p>Wang Tao was truly afraid of stepping over the line. He nodded, “Okay then, I’ll be leaving now. Enjoy your stay.”</p><p>After Wang Tao left, Huo Mian sent Zhu Lingling a WeChat message, asking her to come out. However, she didn’t reply to her.</p><p>If Zhu Lingling didn’t reply, it meant that she was on a plane.</p><p>She had known Zhu Lingling for years but still didn’t understand her schedule. It always seemed super messy.</p><p>There was no set schedule…</p><p>Just then, a group of a dozen or so people, both men and women, sat down beside her.</p><p>A bald man, who looked like he was all fat and no brains, sat in the middle of the group. He was wearing a flowery shirt and a thick gold chain.</p><p>He had his fat arms around two pretty women on both sides…</p><p>As soon as they sat down, the waiter brought up some liquor and fruit.</p><p>“Big Brother Yong, that girl’s not bad.” A pointy-tongued, monkey-like man pointed at Huo Mian, who was sitting beside them.</p><p>The bald man looked over; he narrowed his eyes and checked her out up and down…</p><p>“Go, get her over here and ask her to have a drink with me.”</p><p>“Sounds good.” The pointy-faced, monkey-like man got up and shuffled over to her.</p><p>“Hi, pretty lady, my big brother here is asking you to go and have a drink with him.”</p><p>Huo Mian ignored him…</p><p>“Pretty lady, my big brother is not just anybody. You won’t have to drink for free. How does 1000 yuan per shot sound?” the man laughed as he asked her.</p><p>Huo Mian finally reacted. She looked over at the bald man and asked faintly, “Why don’t you ask your big brother to have a drink with me instead? I’ll pay him 10,000 yuan. What do you think?”</p><p>“What?” The man wasn’t sure if he heard right.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":415,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:22.897","Link":"chapter-415-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-5-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 415 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (5)"},{"ID":181120951234821702,"Name":"Chapter 416 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (6)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 416 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (6)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 416: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (6)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“It’s okay if you didn’t hear me the first time, but I won’t repeat myself.” Huo Mian seriously thought that too many idiots frequented bars. One just left, and another one immediately came flying in. Couldn’t she enjoy a drink in peace?</p><p>The Seductive Fox was the city’s most luxurious nightclub. There would probably be even more perverts hitting on her if she went to one of the lower-end bars.</p><p>The pointy-faced monkey-like man looked at Huo Mian and declared proudly, “Woman, do you know who my Big Brother Yong of the Jiang Bei Gang is? Haven’t you heard of him?”</p><p>“Nope, never heard of him, but I do know that Jiang Bei is famous for stinky fried tofu, does he own any of those carts?”</p><p>The pointy-faced monkey-like man was shocked speechless. “…”</p><p>“Also, what’s a gang? Do you guys walk around at night?” Huo Mian purposely batted her giant eyes at him.</p><p>The pointy-faced monkey-like man, “…”</p><p>“Good, wait here.”</p><p>Then, the man returned to his seat and said god-knows-what to the bald guy.</p><p>The bald guy seemed to be in a good mood and glanced over at Huo Mian a couple of times.</p><p>Finally, he stood up and walked over, his fat belly shaking as he walked. He looked at least 40 years old.</p><p>However, he was wearing a flowery shirt and tight jeans. The jeans looked so tight on him that they were about to burst; his pant size was probably XXXL.</p><p>Huo Mian couldn’t help but laugh at his choice of clothes.</p><p>If this was on the streets of England, Huo Mian would probably have asked him if he was a street performer.</p><p>“Pretty girl, I heard from my friend that you asked me to have a drink with you. What arrogance, you’re the first one to say something like that to me.”</p><p>“If you always walk by the river, you shouldn’t be surprised when your feet get wet. There’s always a first time for everything, you shouldn’t be so shocked,” Huo Mian said faintly.</p><p>She wasn’t scared of the 5 or 6 tattooed bodyguards behind the bald man either.</p><p>It wasn’t that Huo Mian was looking for trouble…</p><p>It was just because, last time when that incident happened, Qin Chu immediately found out what happened and even saw a video of it.</p><p>He was also able to obtain the original footage even before the Zhous tried to delete everything. That meant only one thing – Qin Chu knew the nightclub’s boss very well. Therefore, Huo Mian thought, even if she were here alone, she would still be safe, because if she was in danger, someone will definitely come out to help her.</p><p>That’s why she had the guts to act like that…</p><p>Huo Mian’s brain was smarter than that of others, and she knew how to protect herself.</p><p>She would never do anything stupid and put herself in danger for no reason.</p><p>The truth was, she guessed right. As soon as she entered the club, a man had been observing her through a screen in one of the top-floor lounges at Seductive Fox.</p><p>“Sir, Miss Huo just came into our club.”</p><p>“Keep an eye on her and guarantee her safety.”</p><p>As the boss of Seductive Fox, Rick was well aware of Huo Mian and Qin Chu’s relationship; therefore, he couldn’t let anything happen to her.</p><p>When the indecent hooligans surrounded Huo Mian, the person behind the screen became nervous, “Sir, should we do something about it?”</p><p>“Not yet, let’s watch them a while longer.” Rick supported his chin with his hands and stared at the women in the video.</p><p>No wonder she was Qin Chu’s woman – she sure was different…</p><p>She came into the club to drink alone. Not only did she not have a thick layer of makeup on, but her clothes were also not at all revealing. Anyone could tell that she was different from the rest.</p><p>A woman like that would always shine brightly, even if she was buried in a giant group of people…</p><p>“Pretty lady, I can drink with you, but I never do anything for free. I need to be paid. You said you’ll pay me 10,000 yuan for one drink, right? I don’t need money, I have all the money I could ever need. So, if I have a drink with you, why don’t you sleep with me tonight? What do you think?” The bald man laughed perversely.</p><p>Huo Mian sneered, “Sleep with you tonight? Aren’t you afraid that you won’t live to see tomorrow?”</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":416,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:23.483","Link":"chapter-416-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-6-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 416 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (6)"},{"ID":18112095124145780,"Name":"Chapter 417 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (7)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 417 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (7)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 417: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (7)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“B*tch, what did you say?!” At the sight of their boss being humiliated, the couple of followers standing behind him became riled up.</p><p>“Hey… no need to get excited. This girl’s really funny. I like it.”</p><p>The bald-headed man was used to ass-kissing, fake, high-pitched women. A woman as young and as mature as Huo Mian caught him off-guard; it was refreshing. He wasn’t angry at her at all…</p><p>“Beauty, here’s the thing, you’re not leaving today regardless if I drink this glass or not… why fight me on this?”</p><p>The bald-headed man’s threatening words earned nothing more than a smile from Huo Mian.</p><p>“I don’t want trouble. I just want to be alone with my drinks. You guys should leave… If you keep messing with me, you’ll find yourselves in a lot of trouble.”</p><p>“Hahaha… you’re very cute. What kind of trouble do you think we’ll be in?” The bald-headed man laughed at Huo Mian’s words.</p><p>Without a response, Huo Mian lifted up her beer and continued drinking, calm and unfazed.</p><p>“Jiang Chengyong.” Behind them, a man called out the bald-headed man’s name.</p><p>The man named Jiang Chengyong turned around and immediately froze…</p><p>“Young Master Wei… why are you here?” Jiang Chengyong looked at Wei Liao like a dog looking at its owner.</p><p>The truth was, Jiang Chengyong wasn’t really a dangerous man. He was nothing more than someone from the streets who made a name for himself as a gangster.</p><p>He survived off of charging protection fees and intimidating moms and stalls around the neighborhood, threatening to demolish their shops. He was hated all across the board…</p><p>He was also intelligent, however, as he only targeted ordinary citizens. He was too afraid to offend anyone powerful in the city.</p><p>Powerful people like Su Yu or Wei Liao…</p><p>“I f*cking saw you bully a young woman from very far away,” Wei Liao cursed.</p><p>Soon after, a couple of people came over…</p><p>Behind Wei Liao stood none other than Su Yu himself, dressed in a khaki jacket. Next to them was another young man.</p><p>They partied at Seductive Fox for a couple of hours and were just about to head home…</p><p>As they came downstairs, Wei Liao immediately recognized Huo Mian, sitting in a corner.</p><p>They then saw the group of lowlifes harassing her. Su Yu’s eyes turned green at the sight… He wanted to kill those bastards…</p><p>“I didn’t, I didn’t… haha… I was just drinking.” Jiang Chengyong treated Wei Liao like the latter was his father.</p><p>At the sight of Su Yu, Jiang Chengyong almost began kowtowing…</p><p>“Young… Young Master Su… you’re here too?” Jiang Chengyong asked, his body trembling.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Su Yu walked up to Jiang Chengyong and kicked him in the stomach.</p><p>The latter staggered back and fell to the ground as if he were a flipped turtle, comical as could be.</p><p>“Big Brother Yong!”</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>At this sight, the couple of followers behind him stepped forward to help him up…</p><p>“No, don’t touch me, let Young Master Su continue.” Jiang Chengyong didn’t dare anger Su Yu any further.</p><p>Su Yu walked up to Jiang Chengyong slowly, stomping his feet onto his stomach, crushing him with all his might…</p><p>“Ah…” Jiang Chengyong was clearly in pain as he made a muffled cry.</p><p>“If I see you or your dogs harass her one more time, your tombstone will appear at the north mountain wasteland tomorrow morning,” Su Yu enunciated every word, his entire body reeking of bone-chilling coldness…</p><p>When Su Yu was mad, his phoenix-like eyes shot out gazes as sharp as blades, cutting through anyone’s courage.</p><p>“Yes, Young Master Su… my apologies, I didn’t know she was yours…”</p><p>Jiang Chengyong was clever enough to realize what was going on. He regretted not listening to the girl’s words earlier on…</p><p>Enduring through the pain in his stomach, he held up his head and began to smack himself in the face.</p><p>He needed to demonstrate his loyalty and sincerity toward Su Yu…</p><p>“Forget it, Young Master Su, why bother with a dog?” Wei Liao laughed.</p><p>Tang Chuan also chimed in, “Yeah, not to mention a Shar-Pei.”</p><p>After a while, Su Yu slowly lifted his foot…</p><p>“F*ck off…”</p><p>“Yes, Young Master Su.” At the sight of Su Yu sparing him, the bald-headed man immediately left with his gang, too afraid to overstay by even a second.</p><p>After everything settled down, Su Yu walked up to Huo Mian. Seeing the six empty bottles in front of her, he felt a pang in his heart.</p><p>“What’s making you so sad? You drank so much.”</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":417,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:24.017","Link":"chapter-417-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-7-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 417 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (7)"},{"ID":181120951245137907,"Name":"Chapter 418 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (8)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 418 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (8)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 418: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (8)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“It’s none of your business.”</p><p>Huo Mian turned away and continued to drink. When she told Jiang Chengyong he was going to be in trouble, she didn’t mean Su Yu.</p><p>She was actually expecting the person behind the scenes of the bar to come out and help her.</p><p>She didn’t know how the person was related to Qin Chu, but she knew that they would protect her.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Su Yu inserted himself at that critical moment.</p><p>“Waiter, I’ll have what she’s having.”</p><p>Su Yu waved his hand at the waiter. At the sight of a person of his status, the waiter immediately came over with beers.</p><p>Without a word, Su Yu began to down the opened bottles, one after another… drinking six in one go…</p><p>He shocked Wei Liao, Tang Chuan and the others who were standing behind him…</p><p>“Is Su Yu… nuts?” Wei Liao was dumbfounded.</p><p>“He’s definitely drinking more than usual.” Tang Chuan was stupefied as well.</p><p>Although Su Yu had a high tolerance, it was mostly due to the nightclub life. But, they had never seen him drink so intensely.</p><p>Even if the beer bottles were small, downing six bottles in one go was potentially life-threatening.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?” At the sight of him downing six bottles at once, Huo Mian finally looked Su Yu in the eyes.</p><p>“I’m catching up to you. From now on, I’ll drink with you. It’ll be fair this way.” With that, he took his seventh bottle, tapped it against Huo Mian’s bottle, and began drinking.</p><p>Truthfully speaking, it was the first time Huo Mian saw such a manly side of this spoiled young master.</p><p>“Is something bothering you?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Huo Mian gave a low reply.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p>Su Yu, “…”</p><p>“Fine, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. We’ll just keep drinking.” Su Yu held up another bottle.</p><p>“It looks like they’re not leaving without getting completely hammered,” Wei Liao said quietly.</p><p>“But… if he drinks too much… he can’t… get it up… Should he really drink that much? Wasn’t his goal to get into her panties?” Tang Chuan looked at Su Yu with worry in his eyes.</p><p>“Uhh… you are thinking a bit too much.” Tang Chuan’s words scared Wei Liao.</p><p>Although Su Yu was interested in Huo Mian, he wasn’t about to bring her home tonight.</p><p>He wasn’t that disgusting…</p><p>Su Yu never drank at the bar on the first-floor before. This time, with him coming downstairs and drinking at the corner so boldly, the entire bar was sent into a ruckus…</p><p>If it hadn’t been for the waiters and the security guards holding down the fort, many women would have taken their clothes off and jumped at the chance of being noticed by Young Master Su…</p><p>Wei Liao and Tang Chuan were worried enough being his watchmen.</p><p>After a little more than an hour…</p><p>Huo Mian’s 12 bottles were completely empty…</p><p>Huo Mian’s cheeks ruddied from the effects of alcohol, but her eyes were as clear as day; she wasn’t drunk at all.</p><p>“You have high tolerance,” Su Yu complimented her.</p><p>“No more drinks… it’s getting boring.” Huo Mian stood up.</p><p>“Waiter, the bill.”</p><p>“Miss, Young Master Su has already paid,” the waiter replied politely.</p><p>“How much did the drinks come to?” Huo Mian asked.</p><p>“The total came to 994 yuan.”</p><p>Huo Mian opened her wallet slowly, took out 500 yuan and handed it to Su Yu.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Su Yu furrowed his brows.</p><p>“Combined, we drank 994 yuan worth of beer. If we split that, we should each pay 497 yuan. Unfortunately, I don’t have change on me, so I’ll just give you the extra 3 yuan as a tip.” With that, Huo Mian placed the money in Su Yu’s hands and immediately walked away…</p><p>“Damn woman… stop right there!” Su Yu roared.</p><p>Huo Mian continued to walk without turning her head…</p><p>Su Yu chased after her…</p><p>“This woman’s seriously generous. She even splits drinking bills in half. Hahaha, she’s so freaking adorable! No wonder Su Yu likes her. I would like her too.” It was Tang Chuan’s first time getting a taste of Huo Mian’s attitude, and he laughed so hard that his lungs almost gave in.</p><p>Wei Liao pursed his lips and said, “That’s why I called her a weirdo… she’s always caught up in something unbelievable.”</p><p>Prior to meeting her, he had thought that Su Yu was the toughest person he had ever met. Now, compared to Huo Mian, Su Yu was as weak as a baby…</p><p>She was meaner than Su Yu, and had the guts to throw 500 yuan at him as if he was no one. Nothing like this had ever happened to this man in his entire 20 or so years of existence.</p><p>No wonder he roared out loud…</p><p>“Huo Mian!” Su Yu shouted as soon as they came out of Seductive Fox.</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>“Stop right there.”</p><p>“What do you want? Hurry up!” Huo Mian stopped reluctantly.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":418,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:24.513","Link":"chapter-418-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-8-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 418 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (8)"},{"ID":18112095125535573,"Name":"Chapter 419 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (9)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 419 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (9)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 419: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (9)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“Why are you giving me money?”</p><p>“We’re splitting the bill.”</p><p>“What do you mean by splitting the bill?” Su Yu furrowed his brows.</p><p>“You spend your money, and I’ll spend mine.”</p><p>“Do we have to draw such clear boundaries?” Su Yu became more furious.</p><p>Huo Mian nodded. “Absolutely! We’re not close enough for you to spend money on me.”</p><p>“Seriously… as a woman, you’re really not cute.”</p><p>“I never said I was cute.”</p><p>“How unreasonable can you be? Who would like someone like you if you are like this?” Su Yu was more than annoyed.</p><p>“I’ll just like myself! Is that alright with you, Young Master Su?” Huo Mian made a face towards Su Yu.</p><p>She then turned around and walked away…</p><p>“Hey! Where are you going?”</p><p>“I’m going home! It’s so late, it’s not safe to hang out here.”</p><p>“I’ll take you home.”</p><p>“No thanks.” Huo Mian rejected immediately.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Look at you! You’re drunk and want to drive me? I really don’t want to be punished by traffic cops. I’ll take a cab home.”</p><p>With that, Huo Mian flagged down a taxi and got in…</p><p>“Huo Mian, come back here!”</p><p>After Su Yu came outside; the wind hit his head hard and he felt a bit dizzy.</p><p>He wanted to grab Huo Mian but he was light on his feet and his body was swerving.</p><p>In the end, he had no choice but to angrily watch Huo Mian’s taxi leave… leaving behind Young Master Su with the 500 yuan in his hands, staggering…</p><p>“What happened? Where’s the girl?” At the sight of Su Yu standing there alone, Tang Chuan mocked.</p><p>“Obviously, the girl left and our Young Master Su’s still reeling.” Wei Liao smiled.</p><p>Tang Chuan walked over and looked at the five 100 yuan bills in Su Yu’s hand.</p><p>“Young Master Su doesn’t need this kind of change. Give it to me! I can use it to buy some drinks and get a girl.”</p><p>Before Tang Chuan’s hand could touch the money, Su Yu immediately waved his hand away, holding onto the 500 yuan tightly as if it were something important…</p><p>“Wei Liao, drive me home.”</p><p>“Why don’t you drive yourself?” Wei Liao rolled his eyes.</p><p>“I drank, aren’t police officers focused on catching drunk drivers recently?” With that, Su Yu got onto the Lamborghini’s passenger seat.</p><p>“You? You’re afraid of a DUI charge? Are you joking? Dude, all the traffic cops know you, and no one dares to stop you.” Wei Liao was about to cough up blood.</p><p>“But I want to follow the traffic rules today,” Su Yu said stubbornly.</p><p>Wei Liao, “…”</p><p>Tang Chuan, “…”</p><p>In the end, Wei Liao couldn’t go against Young Master Su’s commands. He hopped into the Lamborghini’s driver’s seat and drove Su Yu home.</p><p>On the way, Su Yu remained silent. He was, however, very into the 500 yuan in his hands.</p><p>He looked at it every once in a while, completely confusing Wei Liao.</p><p>“Is there anything special about the 500 yuan? You seem to care about it a lot.”</p><p>Su Yu didn’t reply…</p><p>When Su Yu wasn’t paying attention, Wei Liao grabbed it from him…</p><p>“Hey… give that back to me.”</p><p>With one hand on the wheel and one hand holding the money, Wei Liao examined the bills carefully, unable to find anything special.</p><p>The only thing that made one of the bills unique was a four-character writing on its back– Long Live Falun Gong.</p><p>“Uh… so, you’re a disciple of Falun Gong?” Wei Liao teased.</p><p>“F*ck off.” Su Yu immediately took back the bills.</p><p>Wei Liao chuckled and didn’t say anything else. He knew that the money was important to Su Yu because it was given to him by Huo Mian.</p><p>That’s why he treasured it so much…</p><p>Wei Liao purposely didn’t say anything because he wanted to tease Su Yu.</p><p>Young Master Su was acting like a kid enchanted by puppy-love. He was seriously nothing but a fool in love.</p><p>Huo Mian, on the other hand, was like a cold CEO of some important company, like those in Chinese romance web novels… completely ignoring Su Yu.</p><p>Why did it feel like they’ve switched positions?</p><p>“You know… Su Yu, if you really like that girl, you need to keep trying. Try harder! Haven’t you heard of that saying?”</p><p>“What saying?” Su Yu glanced at Wei Liao.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":419,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:25.053","Link":"chapter-419-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-9-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 419 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (9)"},{"ID":181120951255507700,"Name":"Chapter 420 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (10)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 420 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (10)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 420: Let’s See Who’s More Ruthless (10)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“There are no inseparable couples, only a homewrecker who’s not hardworking enough.

Don’t drive into a tree.” Su Yu smacked Wei Liao across his head.</p><p>Wei Liao chuckled…</p><p>It was a miracle that Huo Mian didn’t get drunk from all that alcohol.</p><p>There were so many things weighing her heart down, too many burdens she couldn’t and didn’t want to voice.</p><p>When the taxi driver asked for her destination, she was momentarily speechless.</p><p>Was she supposed to go to Imperial Park? She didn’t want to. Her old house? No one was there.</p><p>“Miss, where would you like to go?” the taxi driver continued to ask.</p><p>“Just circle around the city,” Huo Mian said with slight sadness.</p><p>The taxi circled around the city, round and round, for more than an hour…</p><p>The meter had already increased to more than 300 yuan…</p><p>Finally, Huo Mian said, “Head to the city’s First Hospital.”</p><p>The taxi stopped at the hospital entrance. As Huo Mian got out, a cold breeze came up at her and she tightened her collar…</p><p>She had turned off her cell phone and was unaware of the number of phone calls Qin Chu had made.</p><p>After his drinking session with Gao Ran, Qin Chu returned home.

Why are you standing here?” Jing Zhixin was just about to call Huo Mian when he saw her smoking at the entrance.</p><p>He immediately took away her cigarette. “Don’t smoke, it’ll give you lung cancer.”</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Huo Mian replied faintly.</p><p>“Sis… did you drink?” Jing Zhixin furrowed his brows at the pungent alcoholic smell reeking from his sister.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t reply. She leaned her back against the hallway wall and sighed.</p><p>“Mom is awake. Her mood is pretty stable, she’s not as bad as you think. Although she hasn’t mentioned you, I can feel that she wants to see you.”</p><p>“I’m scared,” Huo Mian spoke frankly.</p><p>“Even if Mom is mad at you, she still loves you very much. You can’t avoid seeing her forever, right?”</p><p>Although he was young, Jing Zhixin’s words always made a lot of sense.</p><p>Huo Mian remained silent…</p><p>“Sis… are you really going to leave Qin Chu because of this?”</p><p>“I don’t know yet.”</p><p>“I really don’t want you guys to break up. You’ve already missed out on seven years, don’t waste another seven years just because your families don’t get along. Life is short, how many seven-years do you have to throw away?”</p><p>“Zhixin… somethings are too hard to explain. Love’s not the only thing that makes a relationship work. We can’t just live for ourselves, that’s too selfish.”</p><p>“I know, but I still hope that you won’t give up so easily. Don’t give up the love of your life just because there are obstacles. After all… some people may never come back once you let them go. You never stopped thinking about Qin Chu in the past years right? Last time, when I saw you guys at the cinema, I could tell how truly happy you were even from afar. I knew that you’re happy. You’ve never been that happy when you dated Ning Zhiyuan.”</p><p>Huo Mian lowered her head; it was impossible to tell if she was thinking about Zhixin’s words or something else…</p><p>“Sis, don’t be a coward. Persist through this… don’t quit so easily.”</p><p>“Should I just ignore what Mom thinks?”</p><p>“What if Mom wanted you to marry Xu Liang? Would you do it? Would you live with a man you don’t love just to please Mom? Your life is yours and only you know what’s best for yourself. Sis… you’re so intelligent and perceptive of others, but you can never see yourself clearly.”</p><p>“Zhixin…?”</p><p>“Basically, no matter how bad things have gotten, I still hope that you can hold onto your own happiness.”</p><p>Afterward, Jing Zhixin patted Huo Mian’s shoulders and said, “Don’t smoke anymore. If I see you smoke again, we will no longer be siblings.”</p><p>Huo Mian, “…”</p><p>“I’m going to go get us some breakfast, wait for me.” With that, Jing Zhixin immediately walked towards the door.</p><p>Completely dejected, Huo Mian put her hands on the room door, wanting to enter. Just then, a person called out her name.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Huo Mian asked, since Gao Ran was a strange sight to see at the hospital in the middle of the night.</p><p>“Qin Chu’s in the emergency room being treated for a stomach hemorrhage.” Gao Ran looked at Huo Mian coldly.</p><p>At the sound of his words, panic colored Huo Mian’s eyes…</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":420,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:25.553","Link":"chapter-420-let-s-see-who-s-more-ruthless-10-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 420 - Let's See Who's More Ruthless (10)"},{"ID":18112095126985366,"Name":"Chapter 421 - Don't Mess with Me (1)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 421 - Don't Mess with Me (1)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 421: Don’t Mess with Me (1)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“Where is he now?”</p><p>“In the emergency room downstairs,” Gao Ran said coldly.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Huo Mian ran downstairs…</p><p>“Doctor, how is he?” Huo Mian truly lost it; it was the first time she had felt so afraid.</p><p>If anything happens to Qin Chu, how was she going to live for the rest of her life?</p><p>“The patient suffered from excessive alcohol consumption, leading to gastric mucosal damage and bleeding. Fortunately, he was brought to the hospital in a timely manner. Otherwise, the consequences would be unthinkable. We’ve already placed him on I.V. He’ll just need a couple days of rest. Also… he can’t eat solid food for the next couple of days. We’ll have to keep him here for a week for observation.”</p><p>A couple of attending doctors explained Qin Chu’s conditions to Huo Mian…</p><p>Hearing that he was alright, Huo Mian’s heart began to calm down.</p><p>“Young people nowadays really don’t know how to take care of their bodies. How foolish of him to drink so much, he could’ve died…”</p><p>Listening to the doctors’ chatter, Huo Mian felt guilty as could be.</p><p>Qin Chu wasn’t an alcoholic; he was never one to drink his health away. Even when faced with important clients, he had one glass at most.</p><p>However, he had drunk himself to a stomach hemorrhage this time; it had to be because of her.</p><p>She turned off her cell phone, avoiding all his calls. Plus, she said those hurtful words to him; no wonder he was so hurt.</p><p>Huo Mian followed the nurse while Qin Chu was pushed to a VIP hospital room.</p><p>Looking at his colorless complexion, Huo Mian felt her heart ache with pain…</p><p>She regretted saying those hurtful words to Qin Chu, it wasn’t what she meant.</p><p>It was true that she hated Qin Chu’s mother, but she shouldn’t have lashed out her anger onto Qin Chu.</p><p>She was so clever, but still, she had forgotten about her significance in Qin Chu’s heart.</p><p>She had also forgotten about the seven years of love he felt for her…</p><p>– Inside the hospital room –</p><p>Huo Mian held onto Qin Chu’s hand, his fingers long and pale, devoid of any warmth.</p><p>Her heart hurt even as she held his hands…</p><p>He looked lovely asleep, eyelashes curled and calm as could be; it was almost as if he were a child.</p><p>“I’m so sorry…” Huo Mian felt her eyes well up, her tears almost falling down.</p><p>Just then, Gao Ran pushed open the door and came in. “How is he?”</p><p>“He’s fine now. The doctor said that he’ll recover after a couple days of rest.”</p><p>“Come out for a second,” Gao Ran said coldly.</p><p>Huo Mian tucked Qin Chu in and followed Gao Ran out of his room.</p><p>“Do you know how he ended up like this?” Gao Ran interrogated.</p><p>Huo Mian remained silent…</p><p>“Do you know how much he loves you?” He continued to question her.</p><p>Huo Mian still didn’t say anything…</p><p>“Huo Mian, we’ve known each other for a long time now and I see you as a good friend of mine, so I’m just going to say it. Sorry if it’s brutal to hear but this is my honest opinion. Since you and Qin Chu already got married, then you shouldn’t just throw it all away whenever something comes up. You’re a grownup and you shouldn’t make rash decisions. Saying hurtful words is like pouring out water, it cannot be taken back. I’ve known him for so many years. He’s a very strong person and has almost no vulnerabilities, but… you became his weakness seven years ago. You have him in the palms of your hands to the point where I almost feel like he’s sick over you. But you… you hurt him, again and again, because of external factors… how could you do that? Huo Mian, I really want to know, are you heartless? Or is your heart made of ice? Hm?”</p><p>Gao Ran had never spoken so ruthlessly, but Huo Mian wasn’t surprised at all.</p><p>She simply listened, without a hint of refutation…</p><p>Seeing her still so quiet, Gao Ran’s expression turned heavy. He took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and inhaled deeply. “You probably still don’t know the reason behind his disappearance seven years ago, do you? Why he didn’t contact you or come back to the country?”</p><p>Listening to his words, Huo Mian raised her head to look at Gao Ran. She could sense that he knew of things that she didn’t.</p><p>“Why?” She should’ve known that there were other reasons. If Qin Chu loved her so dearly, why didn’t he contact her or come back for seven years?</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":421,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:26.097","Link":"chapter-421-don-t-mess-with-me-1-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 421 - Don't Mess with Me (1)"},{"ID":181120951266067493,"Name":"Chapter 422 - Don't Mess with Me (2)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 422 - Don't Mess with Me (2)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 422: Don’t Mess with Me (2)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“He made a bet with his father.” With the cigarette in his mouth, Gao Ran explained slowly.</p><p>“What bet?” Huo Mian could sense that the truth was about to surface.</p><p>After a moment of silence…</p><p>Gan Ran took out the cigarette from his mouth and flicked off the ash. “Seven years ago, Qin Chu was only a boy. He wasn’t strong enough to give you a certain and happy future, so he made a bet with his father. He would study abroad for seven years and then return to take over the family business. He wouldn’t return within seven years and was not allowed to contact anyone back home, including you.”</p><p>“Why did he agree to his father so easily?” Huo Mian looked puzzled.</p><p>“Because his father stipulated a tempting condition.”</p><p>“What condition?” Huo Mian had an inkling that it had something to do with her.</p><p>Sure enough, Gao Ran took in a deep breath and looked at her as he said, “Once he returned seven years later, his father would let him marry you. Qin Chu only asked for one thing, and that was to marry you, Huo Mian. So, he agreed to all the impossibly difficult conditions his father put forth. He didn’t even come back for his grandfather’s funeral. Do you know how he got through those seven years? He only had one thought in his head, and that was to marry you. I’m very sure that marrying you was his biggest dream in life.”</p><p>Upon hearing what Gao Ran said, Huo Mian could only stand there, motionless…</p><p>She didn’t know if it was the stinging aroma of the cigarette or something else, but she began to cry…</p><p>Silent tears streamed down her face…</p><p>She had thought that he left for his own future and family business, and the reason had nothing to do with her.</p><p>After discovering that he had studied medicine, however, she knew that things weren’t as simple as she had originally thought.</p><p>Now that she heard about the true reason behind his seven-year disappearance and the bet that involved her, she couldn’t keep it in any longer.</p><p>Gao Ran was right. Even the coldest of hearts, at this moment, would melt…</p><p>“Although his father went back on his word, Qin Chu never wavered even a little bit. He even wanted to resign from his position as GK’s president to run away with you! But how did you repay him? As the love of his life, you talked about divorce and separation like it’s nothing. Don’t you know that his heart is bleeding? You cannot joke about marriage. Even if you were pressured into marrying him back then, weren’t you the one who made that decision? Why are you backing down now? As far as I’m concerned, you have two choices. Either leave him, go far away from him and cut him off completely, or stay with him for the rest of your life. Don’t torture him anymore. He’ll die.”</p><p>Gao Ran’s eyes were bloodshot red…</p><p>He had witnessed first-hand Qin Chu’s disregard for his own life. After they finished drinking, Qin Chu went back home and drank even more.</p><p>If it hadn’t been for his relentless calls and alertness, he wouldn’t have gotten the police to locate Qin Chu, they wouldn’t have found him at Imperial Park, unconscious from the pain of gastric bleeding.</p><p>If they didn’t discover him, Gao Ran may never be able to see his good friend ever again.</p><p>“Huo Mian, I beg of you, don’t torture him anymore. Whatever your decision may be, let him know as soon as possible.”</p><p>Huo Mian was crying her heart out by now…</p><p>“Thank you for telling me all of this.”</p><p>“So? What’s your plan?” Gao Ran asked coldly.</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t reply and Gao Ran couldn’t tell what she was thinking, but from her reaction, he could tell that she cared about Qin Chu deeply. She wouldn’t have cried this much otherwise…</p><p>After their conversation, Gao Ran left the hospital, completely worn-out. Huo Mian went into Qin Chu’s room, wetted a towel, and began cleaning his face.</p><p>After she finished, she took the towel to wet it again.</p><p>Just as she was getting up, someone grabbed her hand…</p><p>“Mian…” Holding onto Huo Mian’s wrist, Qin Chu opened his eyes weakly and called out her name.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":422,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:26.607","Link":"chapter-422-don-t-mess-with-me-2-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 422 - Don't Mess with Me (2)"},{"ID":1811209512736491,"Name":"Chapter 423 - Don't Mess with Me (3)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 423 - Don't Mess with Me (3)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 423: Don’t Mess with Me (3)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“You’re awake?” Huo Mian’s voice was raspy and weak.</p><p>“Don’t leave…” Like a child, he grabbed onto her hands tightly, unwilling to let go.</p><p>Huo Mian had never seen this side of Qin Chu before. He had always been so prideful, quiet, and cold, uninterested in anything that didn’t involve her. Now? He looked so weak, his face colorless and his lips purple, helpless as could be…</p><p>“I won’t leave.” Huo Mian turned back and sat down by his bedside.</p><p>“Mian… I can’t fix what my mother did. I’m so sorry… If I had known that she would be so extreme, I wouldn’t have let my father know that we were married. It’s all my fault. I’m sorry that your mother had to suffer.”</p><p>Although Qin Chu’s voice was weak, his gaze was honest and genuine…</p><p>Huo Mian could tell that he truly felt apologetic towards her mother…</p><p>“It’s okay, I can’t blame you for what your mother did. You are you and your mother is your mother. You shouldn’t pay for the crime she committed. The law even says that children shouldn’t pay for their parents’ monetary debts, not to mention something like this.” Huo Mian was much calmer after she combed through her thoughts.</p><p>Although she felt guilty towards her mother, she wasn’t about to put the blame on Qin Chu…</p><p>She could battle and hate his mother all she wanted, but she couldn’t bear to continue fighting Qin Chu.</p><p>He had been, after all, so good to her…</p><p>Qin Chu was surprised by what Huo Mian said. He had expected her to complain… but she didn’t, and she didn’t even plan on holding him accountable for anything.</p><p>“You’re not mad at me anymore?” Qin Chu asked quietly as he gazed at Huo Mian’s face.</p><p>“Mad? Of course I’m mad at you! I almost forgot about it! Who allowed you to drink so much? Don’t you know how dangerous that is? Gastric mucosal shedding, bleeding out… don’t you know that you can die from a stomach hemorrhage?” Huo Mian was infuriated by Qin Chu’s neglect towards his own health.</p><p>“I know…” Qin Chu smiled bitterly. He studied medicine, how could he not understand the risks.</p><p>“Then why did you do it? Do you want to kill yourself?!” Furious, Huo Mian tried to pull away from Qin Chu but her hands were tightly gripped and she was unable to escape his hold…</p><p>“All I know is, I will also die if I lose you,” Qin Chu enunciated every word.</p><p>Huo Mian felt the pain in his words. It was as if they turned into millions of needles, pricking at her heart…</p><p>With reddened eyes, Huo Mian looked at the weak but ridiculously handsome man in bed. “Qin Chu, are you stupid?”</p><p>“Of course not, I think I’m very smart.”</p><p>“You’re smart?” Huo Mian questioned him angrily. She didn’t think that someone who joked about death was smart.</p><p>“Because I married the world’s smartest woman.”</p><p>Huo Mian didn’t respond. She simply stared deep into his eyes…</p><p>She couldn’t imagine being him, surviving seven years in another country with no more than a simple belief.</p><p>The man in front of her had suffered so much, while she was being cowardly and apprehensive.</p><p>Zhixin was right. How many seven-years did they have left? She didn’t want to run away this time.</p><p>Huo Mian took the towel and continued to gently clean Qin Chu’s face…</p><p>Her strokes were slow and gentle… Qin Chu raised his head to carefully study Huo Mian’s face, gazing at her as if he couldn’t have enough.</p><p>Qin Chu had informed GK of his absence but said that he was on a trip, hiding the fact that he was hospitalized.</p><p>Assistant Yang sent out endless emails into Qin Chu’s mailbox for the things that had to be dealt with…</p><p>“Mian.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Why don’t we leave this place, go somewhere where no one knows us, and start over?”</p><p>Huo Mian’s towel-holding hand paused for a second…</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":423,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:27.037","Link":"chapter-423-don-t-mess-with-me-3-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 423 - Don't Mess with Me (3)"},{"ID":181120951275244254,"Name":"Chapter 424 - Don't Mess with Me (4)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 424 - Don't Mess with Me (4)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 424: Don’t Mess with Me (4)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“How will that be possible? You will no longer be the president of GK if you leave. Who would like you if you’re not a big president?” Huo Mian said jokingly.</p><p>“Mian, I’m serious… think about it.”</p><p>Qin Chu had actually thought about this for a while now. He knew that, for the time being, it was impossible to make his parents accept Huo Mian, make Huo Mian forgive his parents, or make Yang Meirong forgive him. The hatred between their families was not going to disappear easily.</p><p>So why not elope? Maybe time would heal everything…</p><p>Huo Mian still had her younger brother to take care of their mother. They would lead a terrific life as long as they left them with enough money.</p><p>As for his own parents, it was even easier. They had their driver outside and their nanny inside.</p><p>“I don’t want to leave,” Huo Mian thought about it for a moment and said.</p><p>She then continued, “I’ve lived here for more than two decades. Not only is my mom, my brother, Lingling, and my job here, I also have a lot of coworkers whom I’m close to. I’m not that young anymore and am no longer interested in new things or places. We should stay here, I don’t want to live in an unfamiliar city. I know what you’re worried about, but I’m sure we can think of a solution. Let’s take it one step at a time. Besides, ever since Uncle Jing passed away, my mother has been through a lot, raising Zhixin and I, and I can’t bear to leave them behind. If I did, I would always feel guilty, no matter how great my life is.”</p><p>“I didn’t think about all that… you’re right.” Upon hearing Huo Mian’s words, Qin Chu nodded.</p><p>Men and women definitely thought differently. Rather than a discrepancy in personality, there was an innate contrast between the sexes.</p><p>Daughters would buy their mothers flowers and presents during their birthday while sons may forget to even wish their mother a ‘happy birthday’. This doesn’t make the son unfilial, but rather boys were just generally less sensitive to these things when compared to girls.</p><p>No matter how intelligent and thoughtful Qin Chu was, he was nonetheless a man and wasn’t as aware of the small details as Huo Mian was…</p><p>He only understood everything after Huo Mian’s explanation…</p><p>“Don’t go to the company for the next couple of days. You have to stay here. You can’t take one step out of the hospital,” Huo Mian commanded.</p><p>“I understand, honey.”</p><p>“Hurry up and go to sleep. It’ll be good for your recovery.”</p><p>“Can you lie down beside me? I can’t sleep otherwise.”</p><p>“Mr. Qin, you are truly a baby.” Huo Mian chuckled.</p><p>“I can’t help it. I’ve been sleeping next to you for the past couple of months. I get insomnia whenever you’re not home,” Qin Chu said with the most pitiful expression ever.</p><p>Helpless, Huo Mian washed her hands, took off her jacket, and laid down beside Qin Chu carefully.</p><p>Luckily, the bed in Qin Chu’s VIP room was large enough to comfortably fit two people…</p><p>Qin Chu wrapped one arm around Huo Mian’s waist and took in her unique scent. At this moment, he was at peace…</p><p>He slowly closed his eyes and fell asleep…</p><p>Seeing Qin Chu’s face at such a close distance, Huo Mian couldn’t help but admire his profile; he was gorgeous even when he’s asleep.</p><p>Finally, she was unable to contain her fondness of him and stole a quick peck atop his nose.</p><p>“Don’t seduce me. I won’t be able to control myself…” Qin Chu’s sudden words startled Huo Mian.</p><p>“Weren’t you asleep?”</p><p>“How am I supposed to fall asleep when I’m holding you like this?” Qin Chu said as he opened his eyes intimately.</p><p>Huo Mian instantly understood the meaning to his words, and her cheeks ruddied immediately…</p><p>“Please, you’re currently trying to recover. Can you stop thinking about nonsense?” Huo Mian was speechless.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"adsmobiletop\" align=\"center\"><!-- full336 --><script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div><div align=\"left\">\nIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.</div>","Order":424,"BookID":181120947299333053,"CreatedDate":"2018-11-20T09:51:27.523","Link":"chapter-424-don-t-mess-with-me-4-","NameDisplay":"Chapter 424 - Don't Mess with Me (4)"},{"ID":18112095127972841,"Name":"Chapter 425 - Don't Mess with Me (5)","NameUnsign":"Chapter 425 - Don't Mess with Me (5)","Description":"<p></p><div class=\"cha-tit\"><h3>Chapter 425: Don’t Mess with Me (5)</h3><p></p><p><strong>Translator: </strong>Noodletown Translated <i class=\"_hr\"></i> <strong>Editor: </strong>Noodletown Translated</p></div><div class=\"cha-content\" data-report-l1=\"3\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><div class=\"cha-words\"><p>“If we can’t do it, can’t I at least think about it?” Qin Chu looked at Huo Mian with puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>Huo Mian almost caved in…</p><p>Ultimately, she was strong enough to stand up for herself. “Hurry up and go to sleep. Otherwise, I’m leaving.”</p><p>Sure enough, Qin Chu immediately closed his eyes and went to sleep…</p><p>The next morning, Huo Mian got up to buy Qin Chu breakfast. As she went out the door, she was greeted by Assistant Yang, who was carrying a heavy stack of files in his arms.</p><p>“Good morning!” At the sight of the president’s woman, Assistant Yang immediately greeted her enthusiastically.</p><p>“Good morning.” Huo Mian nodded at him. Just as she was about to walk away, she suddenly turned her head and shouted, “Hey, wait a second.”</p><p>“Hm?” Assistant Yang turned around.</p><p>“Are those files for Qin Chu?”</p><p>“Yes, these are all urgent documents that need to be handled.”</p><p>“But he’s very weak right now. Why don’t you get rid of some of the unimportant ones?” Huo Mian was worried about Qin Chu. She didn’t want his morning to be filled with the stress of work.</p><p>“But…” At the sight of the growing mountain of files, Assistant Yang’s expression heavied.</p><p>Truthfully, these documents were all quite urgent… He didn’t know which ones were the most important.</p><p>Miss Huo’s request truly stumped him…</p><p>Before he could answer, Huo Mian walked over and took away half of the documents he carried.</p><p>“…?”</p><p>“I’ll keep these for now and give them to him tomorrow. You can give him the rest.”</p><p>“Um…?” Assistant Yang was truly stunned. He thought to himself, <em>Miss Huo is truly the bossy type.</em></p><p>“Don’t worry, if your president asks, just tell him that I took the other files.”</p><p>“Al… alright.” Hearing her promise, Assistant Yang couldn’t do anything else but agree.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Huo Mian put away the ‘looted’ files in her hospital locker and headed out to buy Qin Chu breakfast.</p><p>“Are these all the documents for today?” Lying in bed, Qin Chu looked over the company files while he was hooked onto an I.V.</p><p>“Um…” Assistant Yang answered evasively.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Sensing that something was off, Qin Chu stared at Assistant Yang and questioned.</p><p>“Miss Huo… she, she took away half of the documents. She’s afraid that it’ll be too much for you.” Assistant Yang clenched his teeth and decided to betray Huo Mian.</p><p>“Mian took them away?” Qin Chu was first startled by the news, but immediately, the corners of his mouth curled upwards.</p><p>Although he wasn’t there, he could imagine the bossy expression on Huo Mian’s face when she took away the files from Assistant Yang.</p><p>“Miss Huo… she definitely cares about you. After all, she is your girlfriend.” Assistant Yang gave the biggest smile he could.</p><p>Qin Chu furrowed his brows. “What girlfriend? She’s my wife.”</p><p>“Wife?! Wha-” Assistant Yang was truly stunned.</p><p>“We’re legally married, got it? Watch what you call her from now on. Don’t call her Miss Huo, she’s Young Madame Qin.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>It was early in the morning and his boss had just dropped a major bombshell on him. Assistant Yang couldn’t keep his jaw up.</p><p>“Boss, when did you get married? Why didn’t I know anything about this?” Assistant Yang looked at Qin Chu with an almost constipated expression.</p><p>Luckily for him, he was smart and never offended Miss Huo. Otherwise, she would’ve killed him already.</p><p>He could be fired at any given time…</p><p>“We’ve been married for more than four months…” Qin Chu said slowly.</p><p>“More than four months? Let’s see… if my math is correct, you got married immediately after you came back from abroad? Oh…”</p><p>“What?” Qin Chu asked with a dark expression.</p><p>“Boss, you’re a pro at keeping your marriage a secret, haha.” Assistant Yang immediately kissed his boss’s ass.</p><p>When Huo Mian returned, Qin Chu was still busy with work so she put down his breakfast and took the rest upstairs to her mother’s room.</p><p>At the door, she handed Zhixin some food.</p><p>“Is Mom awake?” Huo Mian asked nervously.</p><p>“Yeah, she’s awake. Go in. Don’t worry, nothing will happen.” Zhixin patted his sister’s hands in encouragement.</p><p>With breakfast in her hands, Huo Mian took in a deep breath and pushed open the door…</p><p>“Mom… you’re awake.”</p><p>Yang Meirong gave Huo Mian a quick glare and didn’t respond.
